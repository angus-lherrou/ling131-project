there is a heated governor's race in Florida mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum\nRunning against Ron ...\nAnd then Rick Scott the current governor is running for the Senate against the incumbent Bill

point and there isn't I don't see you know all of this in all of this crazy they're ranged unhinged behavior of left wing activist\nI haven't heard one elected Democrat did announce it I haven't heard

Taylor Swift I don't I'm not comparing hurt your bag of a newer I'm saying\nThat's how it significant but I'm the drive by trying to take these things they're so\nDesperate for good news they're desperate\nFor you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team\n... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord benefit a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for they hold uptown Butowsky code red alert to Democrats what\nAre the Democrats were smoking I thought the Democrats are going to win everything like the hill got kind of had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama and one of the most popular respected public figures in America should spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate this column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats or the call to arms are the most popular in respect to Democrats with America's such as Michelle my bell Obama do leading the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance are Democrats and the mid term is what the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up\nI thought you're pretty much had the house already done\nAlthough she's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on and Trump or averse myself\nNow there's a twenty five percent chance that Democrats\nAnd the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves its moment for balding maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible that Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible the Democrats again only twenty seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republicans nominate with a smaller but even more right\nWing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate does even further to the right and even more partners than the GOP majority that day\n... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and try ... Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't show up [laughter] [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see if you don't understand love when you see it you do not understand confidence when you see it you see love\nYou see hatred UC excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies you somehow see division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant tropical scammed along side Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieved but unstoppable dominance\nOver his party our country in every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed this code red alert right to vote ... warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to\nCriminalize his opponent [laughter] what\nThere is the entire Democratic Party which is nothing but radical now\n\nMy point is again\nDo not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and then there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they really believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispirited or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up the turnout ... up interest and they're really ... and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News pull a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women are saying in polling\nData that they have ... new interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed\nTo happen that's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative\nSuburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say\nSo this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n[noise]\nBack in two thousand six soon as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of of uh\nConvinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent but nobody gave\nTrump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win Trump never even wanted to win Trump\nWas the most surprised guy in election night in the world when he won he didn't want to win and they were all the press the Trump headquarters that's what they want you to\nBelieve\nNow they started out saying the same thing is no power is a birthright that every American realizes the Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American ... says the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others\nWho are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the Chinese coms are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the midterms\nThis is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... are attempting to sway American opinion a head of the elections\nHold of a ... watt swim [noise]\nChai comes want the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party to win and they're trying to not our friends at try calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate and triumph over\nThe ...

white\nWomen I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now\nThe white vote has only then won twice in the last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential elections has Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n[laughter] ... ... the left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key\nTo American immigration policy\n\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats realized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections\nWith the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here to Christian I'm On four of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana and pour it saddens me because our judicial\nSystem has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your\nPrivate refuge you have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the\nCourts if you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak every liberal idea and belief that\nNow is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\n\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\n\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\nThe ass not by you in fact\nTo Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative Steve college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each\nOther Hillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christ you out on for listening to wanting\nThey're working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nGet blue in the face that's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles\nDefending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh\nAnyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy\nSenator from

uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrat shoved announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage route by applauded they support it that is who they are\nBut

a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have used or how you doing\nWell thank you long time listener measures her first time caller thank you\nSo it was just a wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing whereas I listened to do it last night I Can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if\nIf the party is destroying the things you believe in love that you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives I'm big on civil to the likes of her\nShort would sure whether it be that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise] [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democrat Party world\nUh our

Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR\nNo plans you may think that and I'm not going to try to just to ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't can\nYou imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump seemed to have any real entrance since he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not convey proper information about him this is only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your or hype\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best staffing pond yes\nOr should have the ... and ... [noise] hey my point is ah today a with Hillary's comments at a base\nOf liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even you set it uh but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility for barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again\nJust wanted to get your thoughts are ... but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism\nOr civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of either trending towards civility or barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant flocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it well\nIt seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempt on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father\nAnd I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy one more thing that\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word or whatnot when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time their basic uh\nIssue was a labor laws and a win\nFor what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been ruined\nIn an anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and had to go on in on militants and violet socialism to achieve their means my boys they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be Mitt were used radio\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance tremendous share where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bills\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure\nIt's worth looking into there is the reason is is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

Ninety six point\nThe arrival of Michael knowing you'll Calvin right there Katie okay new center hurricane Michael making landfall the Florida Panhandle here's Evan brown\nSo my point is that they're not as many people are seeing that men and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this is the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will powers at all\nYou can't miss that these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous\nAnd they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people having a great time these are people that are up beat him happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary democratic protest is Dr King\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was\nIt was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with unforgettable picture to me of these kids\nAre slowing and the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon right I get banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get in\nI didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the ... army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing that was inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies or the exact opposite\nAnd I don't mean that people at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event\nAnd even if you do have some happy people with the Democrats sponsored the audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minute worse the Trump rally crowd has find a way they're found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current about Senator Feinstein this another [noise]\nUsually the documents\n[noise]\nI don't want him to have you ever see no [noise] you know he just said no we didn't [noise]\nAnd I\nThink that talking about fights and can you blame\nWorst body language on another words did she get a hundred percent and match during our son is\nAnd you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\n\nYou don't hand matches do an arsonist you don't give power to an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in thin that Trump\nIs calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss up on dictionaries in a wicked PTO\nAnd trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up and did that Trump is daring they call their supporters a mob\nThey're just they're so used to having it throw in the right back at him with the same force they dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized and they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll [noise]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand sixty to two years ago two years exactly October tenth and the weapons\nWherever montage sheer of people from ABC CNN PMS

Party a flood of GOP lawmakers up bending their nominee F Chuck Todd of NBC the worst maybe you have to come with Trump\nThey may be staring at a total collapse of the party do we just saw that headline yesterday\nAt the hill dot com the Republican House is in collapse\nThat's the story that I had the headline that if you didn't know how to read it you wouldn't think that two hundred nine house seats are all of a sudden switching to the Democrats' side\n\nAnd that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\nThey do not change everything is so formulaic they are so predictable\nAnd predictably wrong they're doing it all over again and they're doing it on the same basis that everybody hates Trump\nThat whereas in two thousand sixteen it's impossible people are not going to vote for this guy\nThat has become people regret voting for this guy they can't believe they voted for this guy and they can't wait to show up and apologize to America for voting for this guy so they're going to do and the only thing they can do and vote Democrat they were wrong in two\nThousand sixteen some of them as we mentioned earlier

children I was amazed how many women were actually and I tend to fly by wire you amazed but I just\nKeep hearing that the suburban women have completely left the Republican Party and that was the exact opposite of what I witnessed last side of the political\nWell I can imagine you were surprised if you have you been buying into the idea that the women have Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a massage innocent all that and you show up at a Trump rally and it's it's at least fifty percent women I can imagine it'd be a little boondoggle by that\nIt was I I don't know if you got any feedback from any other Trump rallies but you get feedback from\nOr what about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were the husbands there could you detect that men were husbands or are they ah for\nThe guy that I was sitting next to his daughter they took out of school they taught her I was just amazed that I don't think that there's any massage any whatsoever of the Republican base I think that\nOf course there isn't this idea that this Republican war on women isn't completely manufactured ally you\nKnow Mitt Romney being asked to debate by Stephanopoulos states ought to have the right to ban contraception wide\nWho's talking about doing that George I don't care do you think so\nAnd Romney stumbled around ... finally made the mistake of answering the question Romney's says Exxon contraception Republican war on women was really boring and ... it's absurd\nIt's amazing the things they get away with the idea that the Republican Party he eats half the population I never understood how that works I mean how they pull that off in\nNon synthetic [noise]\nWhen you saw that last night [noise]\nBefore you go to the opening round the Oklahoma gun in the

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern of such behavior\nMayor told Elle magazine\nAnd her recollection of the Thomas hearings as James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this the first story\nThat was run about ... nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found it so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false sorry first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh up pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from ... Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name swept Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation aspect and an act on it you know we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts you mentioned that's a little bit yesterday but with this novel as it is and that Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried with the\nMom and they left an accident and then fattening or if they begin to help people um it just hadn't have worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything wrong firing of it comes to creating an armed guard on our cars", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "10"}
