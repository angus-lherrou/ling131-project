thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper worthy recipients that I also saw\nFox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable\nThat they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them\nBlow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this isn't everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd until a law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just when they had an assigned this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber mad go bomber because it creates first impressions it it created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh [noise] the narrative if you will as Dr buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what\nAre matters of same thing is happening today with the economic news we ever GDP report today the growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected and so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's\nNothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic\nGrowth is it didn't come in at the to predict in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath\n\nSpecifically Google also all those alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still chugging right along with the drive laws are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this\nFrom the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the\nMidterms nobody talks about this yesterday this was a I bought a left wing media narrative that has created but apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump to today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about the terms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's his tweets\nDid my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss a moment\nWe haven't seen any

have the ability to give him okay Jimmy in Omaha Nebraska we're experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks there what the Jimmy and all my heart rate to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um how much is going to say in advance I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical\nTowards the media and the radical left in this country that I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave or a blue wave I'm Sorry ...\nAnd I think I think these folks know that there's no red I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to eight seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are [noise] and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the I think these package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to hook rather hoping into turmoil I really do\nIt so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the deep state they're not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back so all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws as they can say\nElection invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy or\nPrevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years\nI mean I like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't [noise] I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being on a lot of trouble\nAnd then he said quote they may go past neutral ... thesis has been that the fed would be careful to slow down the program of rising rates if\nThe economy starts to react negatively while we still believe this is the case is comment about

Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot ... going to take action except the theory is\nCrock pot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempt in violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely threatening people and they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and and there's not there's never any condemnation of ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this kind of behavior\nThey chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump ... this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... about the stuff well this is politics you know what's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people's the inter find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our\nIssues they have lied about them if they did the miss characterize them they have attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative people spokesman\nPolicy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no wringing its hands over what's happening to our politics\nBecause the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter so we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to the Trump\nHow a lot of people said Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and high judgment over everybody else while exempting\nThemselves\nThey said Donald Trump is turkey perfectly capable and responsible for it\nAnd the behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it they're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act\nAnd then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this is Dan I mean if you if you wanted to decorate\nAnd dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop this is what you would do\nSo [noise] my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he\nConvened a meeting\nBlack Leadership Conference a young black leaders from all over the country this has not\nBeen done before in in this in this manner\n[noise] uh [noise] and he is talking about the rest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nJob by law enforcement we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I Want to again remind you of

Papadopoulos is thinking of pulling out of a plea agreement they made with Mahler details on that\nIt's not happening and so the sense was that the momentum was being lost\nBy Republicans Republican voters the story was that Republican voters were\n[noise] [noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I don't know what early vote a registered to vote was too late for that but whatever it was ... and now Trump has joined that parade\nPresident Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent the prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare\nHas distracted from news about the mid terms and even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans would go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow there are some who believe that this is another example of Trump pacing just like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nSort of lowering the boom on her at a rally pointing out\nThat she really had no evidence and the way the backup what she was alleging so some people think that he's um during the same thing here are basically tampering expectations\nWith the bombers suppression state but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great anyway\nAnd there's some people think that this is very very artful of Trump that he's getting really really good at this\nLowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome luck of the obstacles that we that we came through\nAnd we try out\nSo we will see Charlie Kirk a turning point you asked a\nTweet in uh let's see there be yesterday that the presidential approval rating has hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need a despite the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN\nPoll and it probably isn't an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen\nBut forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest\nAnd also forty seven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating under twenty ten midterms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\nThis there's certainly a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago\nIt seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president and mid term but how many seats the Republicans win\nIn two thousand ten men terms I\nThink the three\nThe Republicans one sick the free now in those terms conventional wisdom one out\nConventional wisdom is the party out of power ... big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but her point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and\nTherefore we uh we could be looking here at the\n... a bit of an upset [noise]\nThere's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find\nThis it is yes your ego barely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum\nWas leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron the Santa pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half so statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month\nTo put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum now there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate didn't I Am reading [noise] by the way\nIt is possible that the U.S\nBehind gonna in tight Gillum had some ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated for\nA we have the news that he had he paid an under\nCover ...\nThe money to buy Hamilton tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails and tax raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Curry could help him network with power for developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there's a Politico story today I actually saw it last night that Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThat Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win everything\nAnd so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political stir and that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThere are other news stories that suggest drugs drugs has links to them that are the socialists of America appear ready to win and dominate\nAnd convert America after long last too committed

Trump colluded with Russia that is so big\nThat is so outrageous\nWhat has been done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign lying to the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned that in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor\nOn the Trump campaign you never met Trump he never gave him any advice but he was hired early on because the media was happening Trump or your advice virtues obviously fills out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded in the Trump campaign a guy name Stephan helper\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joe submit Seward who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I don't know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador\nIs stepping options you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head\nHe didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true so Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigation go get the ... orange what's all bogus\nThat was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back we don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement\nTo our government the strings the levers of power their positions in at the un I cannot relate to we can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother and but this whole
