to do\nA but St point and you make a great point it's still a firearm it's still around\nAll the rules apply dope ... people don't shoot him if people are you know these are real you could hurt somebody you could conceivably even kill some people don't look people come and kill with blanks literally being killed several people have been killed blanks throughout history so take this stuff seriously\nUh Jay is on line three with a question I may not be able to help with but let's see what we could do hear Jay\nHi yet two things I Want to talk about black powder weapons being taken into Canada and then one time you had a caller who is talking about sanctuary cities which was a little off topic so I wanted to address something that he just overlooks doesn't pay attention to basic details\nWe don't have a lot of times we'll go quickly please\nOkay now I wanted to know about taking black powder weapons into Canada there's a single shot weapons I understand you can take them in the black powder\nAnd what about I I mean is this true still to this what I heard in the past and can you also take a repeating weapon a six shooter revolver with black powder that run a black powder\nI Do not know but a Canadian customs have a website or were you can look that up I'm looking at it right now under firearms in weapons they've got restricted prohibited firearms\nBut you could go to the or just do a Google or duct duct do go search for a government of Canada are Canadian customs now have that information I have a place that you could ask questions there\nSo I Can't help you on that one but I go to center city square the place\nOkay now there was a guy who was talking about sanctuary cities one time and\nI think he completely ah misses the point here is talking against having sanctuary cities when in fact the law enforcement those areas want sanctuary cities because it allows victims of crime to come forward to record their own crabs and it also allows\nThe eyewitnesses of crimes to come forward to what was the culprit Sean joined case somebody hitched on his weapons from him and there were a legal aliens they could come forth\nIt'd be a witness without fear of being recorded\nNow let me ask you a question because there's all the way we need to\nBack up we because there are a lot of things that are being called sinks were sees you talking about places where\nA illegal aliens illegal people people can come into the country are you talking about the gun related sites where cities there's two different things and unfortunately we've used up the time because now I don't have time to come back to you on that I I Apologize but you just uh I didn't know\nWhere you're going on that there are some places that are saying we are going to be sanctuary cities where the state's gun laws don't apply or just or whether we're ... we're not going to force them let me tell you the gun laws do apply it's kinda like these guys just found out when the state says well federal laws\nDon't apply here if we make a gun here and we're still here we use here didn't cross state lines so your federal laws on why yeah well you guys just got convicted of that so\nWork [noise] it's a lovely sentiment I get where it's coming from the frustration this ... foot you just got more changed the law changed the law [noise]\nTrying to just obey the laws say

the area where I heard it\nOpen ground and and ... not a tree around a lot of times you don't even see the deer closer than a couple of three hundred yards\nAnd my partner and I had went up the Snake River on an earlier on and we had seen the big us back God ever been around so he called me up at day or two later and wanted to know if I was still thinking about that one and I said\nSure was so I just purchased a new icon for fourteen skirt and\nMy six and I went out and I are doing that night at three hundred and fifty yards and we went up there and yet because of the bluff on that side of the river where the deer was he had to cross clear on the other side to even see what was up above\nThe insurer not that big buck was there so he took the quarter mile downriver drop me off I snuck up along the base that bluff crawled up to the top\nAnd he was up there still but it was really hard in the tall grass you couldn't see his legs and it was way different even in a life sized target I had shot at the night before\nTo judge the distance but I got my range founder out it was three hundred and sixty two yards and I had a bullet dropped compensation scope\nAnd I dropped it with one shot it came tumbling down the hill and I would have never been able to do that without the range fighter 'cause ... shooting up in the grass and a whole different setting where I cited in my gun a it was really tough to judge just how far away was\nIt actually gives you confidence to make a shot that you might pass up otherwise done\nExactly because over there I had taken previously were\nLuckily a hundred hundred and fifty yards at the ... I just happened down to you know in this open country that doesn't occur very often but I was able to get back and have twice the size\nRack than any of the others I've gotten and if I ever get a

environment is a debate that will be happy for some time what is clear is our need to examine how we got to the point where we go from here\nWe have some serious political differences here at home\nPermanent or not evil\nAnd Gen our opponents in the end we must recognize that we are all American Chris\nKevin thank you for joining me now the secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen secretary welcome back to Fox News Sunday\nThinking it's a pleasure to be here\nLet's start with that terrible synagogue shooting it as you do what now is this an act of terror was a hate crime and how do we better protect soft targets like a house of worship\nFirst let me be clear as to what a pure act or evil you heard that from the president and vice president yesterday or that's what it is a we all I can dentist and strong a term possible and as you know turning turning now to planning and training for a active shooter events\nTo the protection of targeting credits because in general\nI understand that in fact the address officials had been in this synagogue recently\nI asked a it's recently as march we actually conducted a site and visit there with our protected security advisor in the area and it's it's something we often do\nWatch the advice on how to handle it should if somebody comes in to a service in a synagogue what can you do\nWell each individual location eat until then it slightly different and that's why the planning and the training is so important in such and then there is rarely time to think through all her sponsored ability and the response has got to be automatic and that's where the drills in the workshop that we conduct I come in we've trained over nine hundred thousand a\nOfficial throughout the country or we will continue to do that in some cases I mean they just a shelter in place to come into orderly evacuate depended on the circumstances that you should always listen to the individual they're in charge here will direct you\nLet's turn to the mail bomb case is there any evidence at this point that Cesar say oc had any help in\nConstructing and funding these bombs is there a chance that there is an accomplished still at large\nYou know I could investigation is still under way what I can assure you is if there are additional perpetrators they will also be brought to jump to the president has directed all federal resources are to be on top of this or we are we continue to work closely through the secret service and our federal protective\nServices with the FBI and state and local officials and we will bring any and all perpetrators to ...\nFor this one is already signed up there is an accomplice\nZena the FBI in their press conference to announce that one individual I have been taken into custody or the rest of the investigation is ongoing and I I Know that we've all learned more in the hours and days to come\nI Want to hold up but you can't see it but I'm going to hold up the front page from the Washington Post's from yesterday about the GOP groceries or say up and it doesn't say suspect arrested what it says his bombs backed outspoken supporter of Trump\nResponsibility do you think President Trump bears for the actions of those individual [noise]\nThat the president has made it extraordinarily clear that we will never allow a political political violence to take root in this country\nA I firmly believe in the first amendment but anybody who uses the first amendment or are they covered to threaten or committed an act of violence I Will not be tolerated there is no place for hate in this country hate it hate violence and violence we will do all we can at the department of homeland security to ensure that such attacks are not perpetrated\nWe've been talking to this program about the coarsening of our political discourse during the height of the family separation controversy you were at a restaurant where you were as you age in the restaurant and later both doctors want us to your home and laughed at audio applying migrant children\nWith larger home a couple of questions secretary what those protesters did you think that was over the line and\nDo you think do you think the president's rhetoric and politics have contributed to the growing and civility in our in our politics\nI think that uh folks at you know first of all to the extent that folks exercise their First Amendment rights that it's protected in our country but there is a line when\nThose a shooting in the first amendment to incite violence to incite disruption a rather than being constructive to have conversations and that ... the part I I Do not support that\nI you know there was a time very recently credits where either daily had to review myself\nAll of the death threats against the great men and women at the department of homeland security or who everyday wake up to try to enforce the law and protect other American\nUh there is an appropriate way to express your solution to express your ideas I welcome them at all times but these calls to violent these calls and disruption are not affected not productive and frankly they just contribute to additional uh the construction of our ability to work together\nFor much turn to drop your day job but he but a lot of dirty jobs immigration there was a report that the president is considering making a major speech this week in which he will announce that he is feeling the border even two people seeking asylum on what's legal basis could he do that\nI think that the president has been thing and will continue to say and and certainly what a what I had been saying is a this caravan and I'm getting in\nThere is a legal way to enter this country or to choose to enter illegally will be stopped and we're working with our partners in Mexico they had to take an unprecedented efforts are within their territory to ensure an orderly flow and that those who had no legal right to be there are removed\nA we intend to do the same but my general message to this caravan and do not come you will not be allowed in there at the right way to immigrate to the United states and this is not as\nI Want to drill down with us a little bit with the secretary do because according to reports the president may use the same legal authority he did it for the first travel ban will just section to weld out of the immigration and nationality act I fully understand the\nPeople coming from Honduras don't have a right to come into the U.S illegally but on what basis can you say that this caravan poses a national security threat\nHave a crisis at the border right now we're stopping between Fifteen hundred and Seventeen hundred people a day trying to cross illegally into this country this caravan is one ... that but frankly we essentially the caravans every day with these numbers are so I think what the president making clear his every possible\nUh action authority executive per round is on the table to consider to ensure that it is clear that there is a ... right and legal way to come to this country and no other ways will be tolerated\nI fully understand that and a lot of people would say that we should reform the laws of question I have is is talking specifically about a provision where the president to protect national security we're talking in many cases here about women about children about babies how do they threaten national security\nThis isn't a ticket that you don't have a membership and the care of and there are a consistently moment to moment there are those who are raising their hand and saying they're part of the so called caravan and then there are others who yesterday said they were part of the Caribbean today say they're no longer part of caravan\nWhat we're really talking about is a flow of people that are headed towards the United states\nThey have chosen to break laws along the way you saw some of them are frankly overwhelming us through the border between Guatemala and the country of Mexico Mexico has offered them asylum in some cases they have refused Mexico has offer them work permits in some cases they have refused\nAnd I think what the president and I are both saying we want to be clear on this as if you seek asylum did so in that first safe country Mexico has offered the refuge if you want a job that is not asylum if you want to be reunited with your family that is not asylum if you want to just kind of live in the United states\nThat is not asylum their legal ways to do that\nBut this is about the rule of law and this is about understanding who is in the flow and Chris I cannot tell you a secretary of homeland security that I Know every person in this flow what I Do know is that we stopped three thousand people a year\nWho to travel a travel patterns similar to terrorists from attempting to come in the southwest border and as you know in general we stop across the United states pen donors suspected terrorists a day from getting into the United states\nI've got about a minute left I Want to ask you about another one of your day jobs are not the mid term elections coming up nine days from today can you guarantee to the American people that they're voting systems will be secure are now and we'll be through\nNovember a sex but if you go to vote a good you will be able to do so and if you are but we'll be counted\nAccurately and that the world\nNo one party has cornered the market on crazy I saw him at least you can point on that both\nThe way that this exchange is is a reflection of the challenge right now I'm making a point about the challenge of our political discourse and the lack of civility and the fact that the extremes of those were saying the extremes are are are rising and finding more homes to articulate their vision\nThat is what is challenging but I think you can point to a specific television show that advocating or is it as an alley waited on line is on cable news is in a variety of places and I would hope that everyone\nWhether they are a TV host whether they're an elected official whether it's me and my job in academia that we all do a better job of ...\nAnd I didn't think hoping for a politician who wants to come forward and say look I Want to unite the country I Want to see ... or not and adding to the climate of toxicity that we've seen I mean I\nHaven't really checked that package that you played that was that quote Nikki Haley shy and she had such John ... what happened in her state and I think there is a big opening for a politician who wants to be a healer\nThey agree or the one thing you could say where the tests on the politics nine days before an election everything has to do with politics All right we'll take a break here so you are a little later up next we'll just over a week

controls Congress on the house side Democrats need to flip at least twenty three states to take over but races and many battlegrounds remain tight\nJoining me now from New Mexico congressman Ben ray Lujan chair of the Democratic congressional campaign committee\nAnd from Ohio Congressman Steve Stivers head of the national Republican congressional committee\nGentleman we often talk about an October surprise another closing days of the campaign and I I Wonder whether the terrible October surprise this year is the outburst of violence or this last week a total of ... will Democrats\nMake this an issue that the outburst of violence in our politics and tie it to President Trump\nLook go first chapter thanks for having me this morning\nLook no one should be politicizing what happened this week number one be senseless acts of violence that we see in Pittsburgh um the number of people that were killed while they were at a place of worship or is it clear a reason why Congress must act to keep people safe number one um and then also with the number of people who are threatened as a result of those bombs that were were being built across America\nBut look we should come together as a country this should not be a political I'm a response but rather a response and how we can further bring us together\nCongressman's divers can President Trump clearly not be held responsible for the specific acts of violence but for like a culture a discourse that contributes to it [noise] well\nI agree with them that we should not be politicizing uh these acts of violence as your panel said earlier hate has no ideology um if you look at the baseball shooting last year or that happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter\nI'm we need to come together I agree with that I Want to say that a man is not my enemy Democrats are not my enemy they're my opponents and while we have different visions for the future of America in different directions for America we are all Americans first we need to come together and do what's in the best interests of America and no matter who wins\nIn ten days I Believe we can come together and make that happen\nAll right let's turn to some nuts and bolts starting with the real clear politics average a recent poll is going to put them on a screen on the generic ballot question which party do you support in your congressional district\nDemocrats still leading Republicans at this point forty nine and a half percent to forty one point nine percent congressman Lou on does that mean that there still is a blue wave and the Democrats are going to\nIt gained control of the house\nLook Chris what people describe this in different ways I'm confident the Democrats will win back the house this year we built our strategy around our candidates are incredible men and women with records of service many will have served our country in the U.S military a former CIA officers FBI agents were committed their lives to keeping our country safe\nAnd they're connecting with the American people talking about their personal stories I never said this would be easy but we made a commitment to build a battlefield and leaving no stone unturned and that's why I'm confident we will and the majority in just nine short days\nCongressman ... is the fact is history at least as against Joe since World War two the president's party has lost an average of twenty eight house seats in the first midterm after that new president is elected and when the president's job approval is below fifty percent as Mr Trump says now\nHis party loses an average of thirty seven house seats and again\nIf Democrats take twenty three states they take the majority\nCars and stuff is what makes you think history won't repeat itself again in this midterm\nWell Mike we've defied history already in the crabs looked very much [laughter]\nSorry sorry Chris we've we've defined a history already we've won\nA eight or nine special elections we actually have an economy where\nAre we have four percent economic growth we have unemployment at three point seven percent we have the highest consumer confidence we've ever had and we've lifted up all sub groups including a record low unemployment among African Americans and Eighteen to twenty five year olds so I think people will reward us for what we've done we have more work to do\nBut and we have great candidates we have\nFolks are incumbent members of Congress folks who are police officers military folks we have folks who are committed to moving our country forward working together to make a difference so I think we're going to be able to hold our majority uh and uh I feel like momentum is on our side in this last\nWeek congressman Lou ... on the fact is by all objective standards the economy is growing unemployment is down relatives up usually the economy if there's not a war going on is the key issue how do you beat that\nWell look Chris all across America hardworking middle class families are still telling us that their wages and salaries are not keeping up with the cost of living my Republican colleagues is you do not have a voting record to run on that has actually prioritize hardworking middle class families that's number one\nNumber two as you look at the data Chris with what you put on the board there well I never look at any one poll data on our side momentum on our side the energy is clear early voting is up all across America and as long as people continue to turn up and vote we will do well\nThe other thing is we're making sure that the American people know about their voting records of our Republican colleagues when it comes to health care voting to take away protections for people with preexisting conditions and moving an agenda forward that would have actually slapped in age tax on people between the ages of fifty and sixty four and\nResulted in increasing health care premiums deductibles and out of pocket costs for the American people that's what we're running on it again an agenda anchored around for the people around our candidates\nWe've been talking this hour about the tone the ugly town our politics has taken and I want to play some ads that both of your campaign committee or the two chairs of the campaign committees have run against some of your opponents\nWhich party or says a better job on the economy I also think immigration place to the president's strength and I don't know why this caravan issue or why the Democrats think that this works for them it's simply plays and I think to the lawlessness a that a\nPresident Trump has labeled them with the plays into the abolish ice the sanctuary cities this is more of a thing and I think this this is something that works better for the president than it does a for Democrats so that's another it'll\nIt'll be as interrupt for a minute we have a Democrat here what about immigration and the caravan is that an effective issue for Republicans\nTook I think there are two ... of emotions that Dr voters in any election hope and optimism or fear and anger this is clearly a fear and anger a dynamic and a ... a an election not a whole lot I I I think what has been motivating both sides in this election from day one is anger\nDemocrats have been angry since the morning after December or since November twenty sixteen that has worked very well for them throughout twenty Seventeen and has gotten to where they are now\nThe Republicans I think there was a bit of a complacency and then between cabinet and caravan we started to see the intensity and some anger on the right to begin to bubble up the president has been very effective ensuring that pot and trying to keep them as angry as possible which is going to which is going to win that will\nFind well I I I think that the to the congressman's point a local issues obviously play a big role in terms of what I Wonder if that was kind of national issues uh\nYes the uh the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the caravan have helped Republicans close that enthusiasm gap but I think what what the cameramen issue well this is a mass of humanity headed towards the border this was not spontaneous organic and these are these are people that have been rounded up by activists\nI'm an immigrant advocates told what to say to reporters and people at the border and\nAnd plus a bumper crop of not only right to to to do something about the I guess a duty to do something about this I'm very pro immigrant but I Do believe in a sovereign us border and and doing things the right way this is not the right way to seek asylum to America\nLook I I think Democrats have been using immigration to their advantage for much the past year when the president and his family separation policy was center stage\nUm you saw a huge outcry and I think Democrats um we're able to harness some of that energy and have been saying during this caravan a crisis or prior to me a discussion that\nUh that we need to address this issue at the source and and the president's failure to do that has helped to add to this but\nWhen when push comes to shove and you look at these districts the suburban swing districts across the country that are sort of the most competitive and the most nip and talk and people are talking about a caravan versus losing preexisting conditions which is going to be more of the motivator which is going to be more of the driver for talking about the politics of this moment\nI I think preexisting conditions is going to the water\nJason ... uh I I\nI what surprises me is because the economy is going so well that you would think that this would be a no brainer that Republicans would run on that and the president gets you mentioned that it doesn't want he spends most of his time talking about\nIs it that and you've got about thirty seconds here that he thinks and and Republicans thing people are more likely to vote in anger than and gratitude\nWell I think the idea that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would have the gamble that Maxine Waters it'd be the chairman of financial services is something we talk about all the time there's a criticism the mainstream media doesn't talk about the good news of the Trump pecan and me and I think that's very real but people feel it and they're in their pocket books and it helps to Republicans going into the election\nWell we've got a little bit more time to talk about it and then after that's over the election and then we can talk about the election of the speaker\nThere's always business was good these days like your panel say next Sunday up next as we hit the ... midterm campaign things are getting even more heated on the ... [noise]\n[noise] with only a husky ... ... ... and what hamstring\nBenjamin Franklin captured lightning and about\n\nThe end of an ugly week a political violence that's reassuring out most of the campaigning followed familiar lunch with top rhetoric and some funny moments and President Trump usually at center stage here's a look at the action on the trend\nThat live in Florida and all\nAnd God Bless president Donald Trump [noise] under Republican\nLeadership America is booming America is thriving\nFirst [noise]\nBut when you talk about economic murder goes right now remember who\nI grew up

I always loved my grandmother's Italian sausage [noise]\nAfter this dramatic way can we can only hope for more civil disagreements even about sausages and the final nine days with the campaign and that's it for that I have a great week and we'll see how that Fox News\nAnd after school you probably got a job in during your first day at work the human resource staff introduced you to the concept of the four one K. of a matching employer contributions and the advantages of 'em using pre tax money from your paycheck to find your retirement\nAfter investing in the market you had a reason to pay attention to what was going on in the financial world when I got to this point in my life I remember watching the nightly business report on uh PBS religiously\nAnd today most people watch the NBC or or Fox Business or Bloomberg but basically what I'm trying to say is that everything everyone from your professor do your job to the news to financial shows on TV [noise] they've always told you to work hard invest your money in the market\nAnd your retirement will be secure\nBut here's a tough question how's the retiring going for all those people that told you to put your money in the market and leave it there might be going All right but and a lot of cases it's not going as good as they would have you believe\nAnd here's what they're probably won't tell you they won't say my retirement money is doing just fine I'm participating in the market for the last Twenty years locking in my gains without participating in any market losses\nYou won't hear that you probably also won't hear that
