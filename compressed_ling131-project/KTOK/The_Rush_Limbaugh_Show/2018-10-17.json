today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch story so do you mean about ... said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up the entire intelligence community excuse or story\nOr having evidence of how to show you died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation of murder because it is apple watching here you'll come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nBlow it up and you didn't even know what I said well no because I wasn't aware they were using the watch as that\nAnd in trouble if at at elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible\nThere is no way that ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession of his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so on the last ... had entered the password\nFor the consulate wife by network on his watch which I Know he didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there and watch will work on why five\nMost people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife I network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not close together\nBut only if you have answered that why fi networks password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I myself didn't learn you had to do this until a

probably have seen this shit and pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating\nBlue wave including none other than the door yeah I'm\nA Democrat National Committee cheating and election ringing\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right\nSo see and I got rid of Fox willingly open our middle aged had done it Brazil on and hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time

left it couldn't happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact\nOf the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although there is even more survey data now that the ... story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats\nAnd the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focused on this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunned shocked where he was burnt rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what but rock knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nHere they go by and it's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here start campaigning is if this blue wave weren't a deadlock\nIf the blue wave or why you started him me [noise]\nOh yeah I got a ... couple of stories Democrats or something worse Obama they're asking where's Brock at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find mama I'm telling you Obama's not going to GO Campaign and the situation because the blue wave is not a walk and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have a coat

you want me simply couldn't turn it off do you vote for Hillary at what happened did\nAnd all this Trump was the ... late at night Hillary Rodham running them and\nSo he's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two or three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's Enron now I'm not sure you know it's a long time twenty days\n\nSo the a P pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why Trump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they tell about\nIt here's how the story begins facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in congressional elections\nPresident Donald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging in is there any other kinds of interviews and wide ranging\nDo you think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those [noise] [noise] no they're always in a\nWide ranging interview with three weeks before election day Trump dismissed suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor Denver midterm losses or view of the outcome as a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of in fact that's what he said he never said don't blame me\n\nCan I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcripts of the AP interview and their headline Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses house ready [noise] three two\nOne\nHey Pete reporter okay so my question is if Republicans were to lose control of the house in November sixth or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no I think I'm helping people\nI'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those forty eight hours you know where people that had no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names\nLook at Georgia governor many many races and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say that in the old days\nTheir opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have if they do not treat us fairly and therefore if I Do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk of myself\nAnd what about the your tweets are so far these people that say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting\nOh and I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that at some way of getting out the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox and I know of\nWhat some of those but there's so much this information being put at that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour [noise] I don't go to eat and I thought social media would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest economy and the history of our country and it's not being reported\nOr you go it's that simple he's the only way to get his message out he's not gonna stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated them and just CNN's media media whatever\nGuys they didn't do much talking residents just too much media there's too much he's gotta he's gotta stop promoting the country and so they're so frustrated they can't stop it

Don rollers wrapped it up mowing his big mother is going to be releasing at\nAny moment are going to be talking about before the midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's do the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that will then influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that port\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be trouble be removed after the midterms when lower it\nReleases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my\nAll of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really ended\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not that it is made public\nSo if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Mahler not conclude the investing particularly if he hasn't found any collusion of the Democrats win the house they're going to tell why don't we got time man we got all the time in the world keep getting\nI don't know what they do in my opinion smiling and can be\nOne out of every five more years returned from the\nMost traumatic stress disorder help support them

blown out the circuitry a necessity ... we were only there for what was the five minutes max\nNot even that uh we know when it goes down a on our own\nBecause we have warning systems early warning systems or emergency services warning so we know so we saw it immediately it was down and the only thing we could think of was that I blow it out with the energy level here of the content of the

to have you here\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russian I have two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor for ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay\nAgainst a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people are happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats were fair and my dad was a Democrat by mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening um he said the Trump ... and he says she only reason the only way I can get my message out well\nHis tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand [noise]\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which treat tweak most of the time and the press conference they ... they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well and that shocked geo right\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen\nHow we can take bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national depressed and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or audio ... that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea they hire a newscast and they\nWhy do you think that you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you is the reason\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with\nAll the jobs and all of them a ... wage is going up or might never seen anything\nMy point is I think you're going to be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all\nOf this and that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry that covers surprised they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have much to say Russia probably ... be met more amusing radio one thousand tape you can [noise]\nAll right to all of our

this doesn't happen to the recliner\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current\nIn either country it is a\nModern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspapers one of them's big one of them small one of them is very serious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than\nPure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people\nPowerful people rich people there obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the ... there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em\nOut and and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their\nCrosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs latte if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\n\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh\nIt's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them anything for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape\nA couple of times watching this thing at how brave in early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that

problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor who has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ... I'm not apologizing for anything if you don't like and live with it\nAnd the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to post or the pictures and the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise] it's just it's ... it's it's perfect it's the kind of personality you what happened to be if your job is destroying people no conscience\nThe belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nIs decent nobody is white [laughter] it's amazing how this ...\nISIS of a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine the real journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the ... story while the other paper\nPuts it on the cover having confirmed it because the editor at the other members doesn't care whether it's true or not whether he calls it got as a beat up I'll just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts to run it and so the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously you're not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of it is ...\nI have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed earring 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about a year and if you watch these kinds of things it's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not a current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's a it's a bad hip\nEverybody everybody as a rubber baked including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] uh I I have\nTo admit I was so [noise] anyway here's non of Brazil now I Would I did not lose

them back\nAnd yet and kept the generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought now NBC is is is very very worried\nThey're worried that something that's not a blue wave may be shaping up here that's what this headline is certain certain\nThey over a blue wave NBC News minds Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty four team to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen to current\nHelps put these numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include I complete picture of registration from those years\nWere asked plenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time well what that's all you need I mean if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it's that seems like a little\nHope will we don't have a full database or numbers for to do so they say well you've got enough to know\n[noise] so how can this be how can voter registration with Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration because there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake\nThen they call 'em from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull trying to help the Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans headlined\nWill the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\nWhat Megan McCarthy all in this op ed in the Washington Post is doing is

I I'm I'm not making the point is blue waves dumb but there's a lot of my\nEars that CNBC poll do not expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories in a row here plus ... Brazil about\nThis now I don't want to make too much of it but that's the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing it back\nFor Strategic reasons and still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able to discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades that'll bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but we'll get back to this\nI Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi and a Damien nice to have your welcome to the E R B network\nThank you Mr lumbar I appreciate it does have definitely a bucket list item from me well I'm Glad I appreciate that very much\nUm so I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the midterms\nNot not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh I don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the fight the Democrats' chances and no boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term [noise]\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worse there is\nIn in the in the quote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and vaunted department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections mean call me even cited\nAs reasons for doing some of the things that he did it out\nI Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact\nOpposite forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this it may even be a written the regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman late procedure that the the O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales that justice our wind the department of justice does nothing including indictments\nThat would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases that I had to exonerate heard their futures dependent on up\nTheir careers depended on it and she was a Democrat nominee they're not going to be in the business of charging and pursuing indicting the Democratic nominee again citing the unwritten regulations not impacting the election so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in Mahler report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to lead that Mueller is about finished\nSince they've decided to leak that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to [noise] not have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise]\nNow you know this is going to drive the left literally batty\nThat it ... they're not going to be able to restrain themselves\nHow long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is how long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian\n... Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we know it shouldn't affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not well let's play the game let's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's gonna be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what are you\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on Mahler to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see him and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week there's sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the good yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to get one T a blue\nWave if Mueller doesn't have any of that than there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nNow he's out they're calling the porn star who by the way is a back stabbing black mailing\nDouble crossing\nPorn star is that they're calling a horse race and there are shutters and the drive by maybe su Didi of the\nPresident's doesn't it you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called paragon virtue on the left where won ten perversion has become normal in their world and they demand that we accept wanting perversion as normal they sit there and act like\nYou all women Austin but we're not talking to a woman we're talking about a dual at ... um what porn star doubled crossing\nBack stabbing woman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer\nShe's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call her name she is a woman who attempted to him\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like people don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on people talk\nThis way this is what ... what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning pure as the driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply look at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people\nI mean they're they're comedy has become literally hate\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social ... Gresham genetic history of humanity has occurred when Donald Trump uses the term horse space\nOr when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in\nThe truth about her allegations I just I just find that that just a little bit hollow as though take your pick take ... take your pick any left wing or on media griping about Trump's\nUsing the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter never talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the presidency\n[noise] [noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they can try all day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters like she said that in fact that\nThere's so much good going on here focused and don't don't need to distract every body with\nThat stuff but he did\nThey're also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder\nOf the uh of the journalists is in the Saudi consulate in\nIstanbul a dramatic a shaggy they're still working on that but I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works and now I have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to printed yep just cleared the transom here\nUh it's about Trump's approval numbers are probably much better and much higher than anybody on the left and the media wants to add Mitt\nNow do you I Will continue only be miss where\nIf you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you can consider cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars guardian mobile delivers the medical ... right to your smartphone and it fits in your pocket and you can take an EKG anytime anywhere to order ... cardio dot\nCom and then you have a hard day I hate dot com and give you feel heart racing or other than that\nThey can EKG on your phone and it just thirty seconds you can have peace of mind knowing your heart rate them as normal cardio is also prevented attacks atrium relation comment heart condition and leading cause and I'm going to order ... today mythic guardian dot com K.

like the twenty fifth amendments always fall back when nothing else\nWorks\nNow to CNBC story about\nThe blue wave is next don't expect a big democratic wave this fall says and it was the NBC poll\nWith the economic optimism soaring in the country will Democrats be able to sweep the power in either house or will buoyant settlements help Republicans ski pole of their majorities latest CNBC all American economic survey\nOffers mixed signals that leans against a waiver Democrat election like that those that swept the Republicans to power in two thousand ten and two thousand fourteen\nNow those or red wave election thank you for rock Hussein oh\nCNBC survey not seeing it here and you see this more and more as we get closer and closer to the\nThat she didn't know anything about the event she couldn't tell anybody where it happened when it happened she couldn't describe the house where it was she wasn't even sure of the year much less than a month she\nIdentified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump there was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because the drive by it's had not\nAnd that then cause the meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cause which was getting rid of ...\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer immediate not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports over and over Trump saying it while accusing him\nOf mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo my career he would've had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he's simply\nReminded everybody in the real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point in the outcome of those hearings make no mistake\nOnce Trump\nDid that and caused the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford van is jihad no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople with a common sense there was nothing that you believe her yeah the basis of what well it just sort of that one but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said that we're there to say they weren't\n... she became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in cabinet came in and of course his his re testimony has re appearance was a subtle factor number whole thing is happening again\n\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum on ... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels\nAnd the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested\nA lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around a drive by Israel they're making a hero out of her Stormy Daniels became a cause lab even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart a judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump claiming it was bogus it had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn lawyer who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she\nHad been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the the the prostitute porn star is paying Trump\nWho among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it\nIgnoring that the stripper porn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees but when Trump called her horse race in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story\nHis victory so you can sit there and say that\nIsn't there is a guy guys they were talking about people that way I think it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original take or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take on the record\nMedia says wow it was very reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible vertical phone shantytowns surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you have no evidence and here's the evidence that she has no evidence blah blah by the\nTrump gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit a bit from the media was not reporting and she had to pay his legal fees the media was not reporting\nOf being Trump win\nAnd remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin\nTrump campaign finance violations and all that so you can say you may not like the methodology but it ends up working as an email friend of mine said this is ingenious at\nWork [noise] trust Trump\nYou mean too but he thinks it calling her horse race was genius somebody\n[noise] you have an email that I have here let's see what the Democrats try this headline this is\nFrom the hill dot com Democrats damp down hopes for climate change agenda what what does this say\nDemocrats are on the likely to pursue major climate change legislation even if they win the house majority despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address the issue\nIs represents a shift in strict the jury for when House Democrats last control the chamber in two thousand nine they they're not going to pursue it even if they win the house majority they're not going to pursue it\n[noise] a wonder why\nCould it be that in the span of forty years we've now have the force ten year warning\nAt least the fourth warning we only have ten years and in the midst of these forty years we've also had reports that we're beyond the point of no return that there really is nothing we can do\nThey've tried everything now they're even saying that climate change is going to destroy beer and there's nothing we can do you know why\nIs climate change going to ruin barley it's gonna ruin the ability to harvest and grow barely barely won the primary ingredients and beer [noise]\nBad news for judge capital right\nInvestors business daily Trump's approval rating is better than you think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure\nBut the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved or the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork you was it was\nAfter the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been if Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive crumble the GOP\nOr the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does\nI have to think that the drive buys are fully\nAware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher here's that story certainly you didn't believe it Daily Beast Democrats fear Obama going soft for the midterms\nI started to walk away and act actually helped me out a deli reading a transcript of your show coming home on the railroad everyday turned me into a conservative so thank you\nWow I [laughter] I'm flattered thank you\nI'm Sorry but\nIf you live in a district that is the closer you got to get out and vote because the alternative is just horrible and I compliment you for keeping up you know keeping people focused make sure as we get through the next three weeks that they are focused in and voting Republican and voting conservative\nBecause the alternative is just going to be totally ridiculous ... decade I Am\nI Am still in the in the process of preparing to alternative what would it be like today if Hillary had one and what will it be like after Democrats respect the house I think that's the best way to go about this rather than\nJust bugs and go to vote remember to go out there and let me ask you a question about that I'm sure you're you're you're on this program this program is is a\nTailor and it it has the audience have has do you really think the people in this audience or so soon the Fox News' audience do you think they really need to be reminded to go out and vote\nUnfortunately I think some do because um October surprises maybe Trump will do some sort of sweet as you mentioned earlier that might be\nLacking you know tone or judgment in some people's opinion that might change from last minute ah but you know the vast majority obviously are going to vote Republican but you know just\nThat they're just keep reminding them of what the alternative is it somehow they decide they are on the fence all of a sudden\n[noise] well I you know I Try not to do much differently as when predators be consistent uh all the time of year round and so forth um\nI kind of ... I look at vote turnout a in an election like this I I like to assume that's why I asked me why white to assume that the audience of this program is fully aware and up just like you are I think your typical of people in this audience there\nYou're here because you're concerned you here because you're\nEducated informed and involved and invest in in an outcome I most of the people in this in this audience are exceptions obviously so I I I worry that it's somehow talking down to people to\nNot remember you're talking about their vote you know you don't want the Democrats running out there are people already know that other words I'm looking for\nDifferent ways to accomplish the same motivation [noise] [noise]\nHi I'm Frank drink being an athlete professional fighter no stunt man is physically demanding but right now I feel at the top of my game after returning from fighting in my late thirties I was in ... injuries gain a ton of weight loss motivation [noise]\n... when I met with documentary cocky ... men like me physically demanding more stressful jobs are at risk below just not through my ... got me back in the right track I started being active again bringing my kids more and now I feel better and more broken\nHi I'm Dr are talking if you remember not too much thought it was physically demanding job like first responders or construction workers knew you were at risk for ...\nIf you'd like three ... energy decrease your strength or improve your performance and we can help\nCall universal men's clinic at four zero five nine for two thirty one hundred that's four zero five nine for two thirty one hundred more visiting universal men's clinic dot com\nOne hundred and twelve will be allowed to trick or treating this place and I know I wasn't for the Matthew society where they want the houses\n[noise]\nPlaces and I have a question I continue to get the emails about the [noise]\n\nSo called Washington Post journalist or jump off your shopping [noise] my\nQuestion is a really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid to what\nHas it been confirmed if something happens since this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia has it been confirmed not confirmed so it's still likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music while they did all of this\nAnd of course until I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like\nProof existed in the form of audio recordings to show ... knew what was in store for invented finagle is apple watching the recording this stuff and it was somehow is I found that very very unlikely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I have a tough time believing shall we even knew to do or how to do but\n\nAll of this concern and remember\nHillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in Ben gossipy\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see a a disparity here in proportion now of course\nWe all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way\nOf blaming Donald Trump for his CNN\nAll afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable a graphics that they are using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here\nAnd again I don't think the media realizes how obvious there's subterfuge is the people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had two ... two doors did you know that\nThe doctor balls the foreign had two doors that something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nAnd handed over to Google employees reading the ...\n\nWait a minute was a five hundred square foot plates and two front door is it the\n\nOther Google employees going back and they had their own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than\nMeeting at four claustrophobia and ... D\nLike being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years [noise] well anyway everybody has a home with a front door and the lockout um most people have one front door for some people that's\nAll they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every\nWindow is what's important to feel safe in the side\nNow how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was his name was fairly expensive and then simply save home security came along offering a solution\nTo protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using states will be our technology and the systems they make\nThey use ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the age the cameras emotion detectors the glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary base station in the house my wife ... already wires to run that is so\nSo important so crucial\nIn making this last complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to hack it I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife I connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use ... and they use computer chips in their sensors in an detectors in the age the cameras that come with every system send signals doors and windows are open\nAnd if you are armed or simply say system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or are there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do when you finish\nYou will have an intimate knowledge and awareness\nOf your system it comes pre tested in pre configured\nAll you have to do is installed or get somebody there to help me it's no big deal you can do it in less than an hour but don't let that make you believe it's not serious it's deadly serious it is serious serious it is just as effective in justice comprehensive as any other security system you would get that uses wires", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "17"}
