Fox News\nWe've heard Saudi Arabia's version of what happened to Washington Post columnist ... after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey now Turkey's president says his country will unveil its own findings on the show he's killing on Tuesday they asked at the U.S considers a response\nThe Saudis have not acted as our friend and they need to change their behavior\nI I understand I understand that but I'm asking you directly about the president's reaction he says he finds credible an account that you find incredible why do you think he's doing\nExactly [noise] I don't know uh the raising our cat answer for you know the president's thought process on this I can only say that I think many of us looking at the situation think that this could happen in an authoritarian government without the crown prince being involved\nAll right but let's talk now about punishment and what to do about it the president says he's going to work with Congress to try to find a way to sanction the Saudis but he made it clear one of the things he doesn't want to do areas\nThat would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand just\nNow last year long before all of this you came within four votes of blocking for their arms sales to the Saudis first of all what do you think the chances that you can get those four votes and blocked them this year and what about the president's argument that this means hundreds of thousands of American Jobs\nI think if we were to have a vote in the next couple of weeks on whether or not to sell arms to Saudi Arabia we would win overwhelmingly\nThat's why I think the powers that be we'll try to prevent us from having that vote they have to announce a specific case of arms being sold and my production is they'll avoid doing that as long as possible with regard to jobs I don't think armed should ever be seen as a jobs program\nBarn or arms are military arms the sophistication arms are part of our national defence these aren't something they're just owned by private companies they're owned by the country\nAnd I think we should never sell arms to any country unless it's in our national security interests I think the war in Yemen actually increases our national\nRisk it makes us less secure in the middle east it makes it more likely to be involved in another war in Yemen so I think we should not be supplying the Saudis with bombs have been indiscriminately killing civilians just in the last month fifty school children were killed in a in a in a bombing of a school to a school bus\nOr they killed a hundred and fifty people at a funeral procession do the Saudis have not been acting in adjust fashioned\nImage one of the poorest planets on the earth millions of people that are placed starvation over a million people at Colorado and the Saudis continue to block their pores so no I don't think that there was a national security reason for us to be involved in the war in Yemen and that's where our arms are going so I Would cut up arms sales that's the only thing the Saudis will listen to well\nAn interesting figure Russian President ...\nUh talked about this and he has said that he believes that the U.S has a double standard he noted that after\nThe alleged poisoning of that Russian spy in Britain that the U.S expelled ... Russian diplomats and imposed sanctions and he looked at the the lack of action so far and says that that's a double standard one does ... have a point\nAnd beyond blocking arms sales and you say you don't think that the White House's even offered them at this point what else should the u._s. do if anything ...\n[noise] well I think there are there is a double standard it I think that the Saudis need to be treated as who they are in the context of who they are I don't think they are a friendly ally they had been spreading hatred of our country for a decade after decade with regard to whether we sanction them or whether we have arms sales I\nThink the arms sales actually will go on I think they will avoid announcing the arms sales to try to prevent us from locking them so I'm not saying that the Trump Administration will stop arms sales I think they will continue the arms sales and I think this is a danger that Congress many in Congress\nWill act tough on this and they will pretend to do something which is sanctions but I'm not even calling for sanctions against Saudi Arabia in general I don't think we should quit trading was already Arabia I think we should specifically quit aiding and abetting them in an aggressive war in Yemen and\nHe'll have been as we pointed out you have been a real skeptic of our relationship with Saudi Arabia for many years when you are certainly given evidence of that today but here's the counter argument for President Trump he says that we depend on Saudi Arabia\nFor cheap oil or cheaper royal he says we depend on the Saudi Arabia as a potential counterweight to Iran and its ambitions in the middle east and that we can\nWe hope that Saudi Arabia will help us broker a peace deal between the Palestinians and Israelis you think he's wrong on all those French [noise]\nI think there's a thousand year old war in the middle east between Sunni and Shia and Saudi Saudi Arabia's put it up against around\nThe biggest thing that destabilize the middle east and I think the president agrees with me on this was Iraq War there was much more of a balance in the middle east at that time\nBut if you look at military spending right now the Saudis and the Gulf she dumps that are their allies spend eight times more than Iran and so there is an arms race but when we supply arms to Saudi Arabia Iran responds so when we complain about the Iranians having ballistic missiles\nThat they are developing they're doing that in response to the arming of the ... it's a bilateral arms race that goes on and on\nAnd so I wouldn't continue it I don't think we need the Saudis the Saudis need as much more than we need then we have incredible leverage their air forces entirely American planes they can't last a couple of months without parts and mechanics to help them run their air force we train their pilots they're completely dependent on us we need to tell them to have\nAnd if they're not going to have and that includes cutting off funding to all the schools that teach hatred of Christian Christians Jews and Ender's [noise]\nI I I Want to get and we're running out of time to one final subject it appears that President Trump is about to pull out to tell the Russians that we're going to pull out of the INS medium range missiles trade a a treaty that Ronald Reagan signed with Mikhail Gorbachev back in Nineteen eighty seven here as the president yesterday after\nThat have said in the agreement and we bonded agreements with Russia not hung onto the agreement so we're going to terminate anyway but we're going to pull out\nI got about a minute left the president says he will stay in the ... only if Russia and China which was not a signatory to the high enough rate will abide by its turns your reaction to this er [noise]\nI think it's a big mistake to flip in league get out of this historic agreement that Reagan and Gorbachev us on this was a big part of Reagan's legacy and we should not get rid of it it was an important step we went from sixty four thousand nuclear missiles down to Fifteen thousand it has been in historic agreement\nI think what we should do instead of getting out of it is I've asked the president and advised him privately and in public\nThat we should have a point nuclear negotiator nuclear arms control negotiators to actually work with the Soviets we have complaints that they're not in compliance they also have complaints that some of our missile launchers and Europe are not in compliance let's have a rational discussion with experts on this and see if we can resolve you\nSend out a tweet that said that you think this is one reason why John Bolton should stay out of this why haven't personally [noise]\nThink John Bolton is the one in ... the president to get out of the IMF trading and I don't think he recognizes the important achievement oregano Gorbachev on this look I spent an hour with Gorbachev a couple of months ago and they still regard this this production of nuclear arms in the disaster that would be nuclear war I think in a very sincere matter at least from Gorbachev\nThat reducing the arms was very important and I don't want to see another nuclear arms race with with Russia or with any other country\nUm I'm all for trying to sign an agreement with China but that would have to be a brand new agreement in there's no reason to end the agreement we have with Russia\nSen Paul thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you know I'm not for bringing our Sunday group to discuss the Saudi account of what

to join us today ... declined but congresswoman mix Ali joins us now from Tucson and congresswoman welcome back to Fox News Sunday\nMorning Chris thanks for having me on\nYou and send them a had a debate this week and the key moment came near the very end of the debate when you know to the back in two thousand and three your opponent was on a radio\nTalk show host hypothetically talked about joining the Taliban and cares for the most said quote I don't care if you want to do that\nAnd that led to this exchange from the debate I\nTo right now what we're going to apologize to the veterans me for saying it's truly are running out of the times found Martha has chosen to run a campaign like the one you're seeing right now it's ... and ridiculous attacks and clearing my campaign\nCongresswoman do really think that the restaurants that I was a proven ...\n[noise] well\nIt's her words crafts uh it's totally out of step with American values when she clearly says in this radio interview she has no problem with an American going to join the Taliban and look Chris this this is personal for those of us who served and actually fought against the Taliban\nSquadron commander over there with my eight ten squad and we're getting shot at by the Taliban the Taliban was killing Americans and I'll tell you the worst days we had at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nWas when an American gay there last breath fighting for our freedom and fighting over there and was killed by someone from the Taliban or their affiliates we would stop everything we're doing\nI think would line up along the ramp as their flag draped casket came by and we would each then salute and silence you couldn't hear a pin drop\nAs we said goodbye to this American Hero who was killed by the Taliban so this is this is out of step with American values this is personal to those of us who went over there to fight a and and it just shows that she's disqualified to being in either state senator\nI fully understand your your feelings and emotions about what you went through in it of course we honor your service as the first female a U.S fighter pilot to to ever see combat which was historic but but to get back to the campaign ... says look\nI had two brothers in the military one of them is still serving in the military she said this talk show host was going off of presenting all kinds of hypothetical ideas and I was just trying to shut him down and get back to the fact she says that she opposed the Iraq War which was just about to start in two thousand three\nWell Christie continue to make excuses as she has yet to make an apology but look this is a pattern for my opponent\nRight after nine eleven a moment when the country was unified in our healing and our morning but also unified that we've got to go back go after the Taliban who harbor dial ... who killed three thousand Americans here just cinema was protesting right after nine eleven any military action against\nTerrorists she was protesting later and I think to to\nShe was leading protests multiple protest inviting anarchist socialist other handing out flyers at her protests depicting American Soldiers\nI skeletons and saying we're the ones conducting terror in the middle east\nSo this is just a pattern of my opponent over many years where she has been a radical left activists a Green Party activists rock and very much against our military and I mean these are the facts that need to come out in this campaign I can I to me you know we serve twenty six years in the military three hundred and twenty five combat hours fighting for our freedoms\nAre on the other hand uh she's taking some uh attacks are making some attacks against you and I want to talk about one of them according to the latest Fox News poll the top issue for voters around the country as health care and son in law is hitting you on that she notes that you voted for repeal\nAnd replace last year which under its terms would have allowed stage to let the it would've been permitted to states do allow a insurance to be sold for people with preexisting conditions with higher premiums here is what ... said about you in the debate\nThe reality is that there are signs are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha voted to take that protection and what\nDo you acknowledge that protection for people with preexisting conditions was significant really weak or under repeal and replace than it was under Obamacare [noise]\nChris I Am passionate about protecting people with preexisting conditions and forcing insurance companies to provide them health insurance I voted to make sure that they had that uh that coverage\nOf this is a classic editor laughed all over the country the lives that they are perpetuating uh in order to play upon fear the reality is it Obamacare right now is not covering people with preexisting conditions we can't go back to we were in the past\nWe all know somebody who had diabetes or as a cancer survivor asthma who couldn't get access to health insurance\nBut their intentions don't equal policy outcomes I met an entrepreneur last week who decided to start a small business with a preexisting condition she uncovered right now under Obamacare So we're trying to move towards a system that provides more options more choice for people or the lower the cost or that allows the but come on and I personally\nWouldn't let me let me just jump in here ... under repeal and replace the building you voting for if someone had a lapse\nIn coverage of sixty three days and of course a lot of these are the case with a preexisting condition of people don't have insurance and then want to buy it\nOr if you had a lapse in in a covered for sixty three days states could force those people instead of buying it from an insurance company to buy it from a risk pool and knock down the premiums would be higher that's exactly the kind of thing that Obama\nThey're trying to prevent\nThat Chris what we're trying to do again is not have the federal government one size fits all top down approach while protecting people with preexisting conditions allowing state flexibility and I\nAdvocated we have a hundred billion dollars stability fund their I advocated for another Fifteen billion specifically for maternity and mental health\nAnother eight billion specifically to make sure that states are covering and supporting people with preexisting conditions again there's a complex this year we're not going to solve it all here this morning but we were trying to move away from the failures of Obamacare towards something that actually provided more options at lower cost\nWhile protecting people with preexisting condition again this is just ally we're seeing all over the country playing on people's fears but I wanted to voters to know I'm committed to protecting people the freezing conditions I'm fighting for it I fought for it and I voted for it and I'll keep doing that in the Senate\nOr there was a rally yesterday that the president attended and and and spoke very much draw on your behalf at that rally he also talked about that caravan of thousands of migrants headed and from Honduras to the U.S [noise] areas and [noise]\nI think there are wonderful for some people in those groups you got some people in those groups and I'll tell you what this country don't want them\nCongresswoman do you support the president's policy on migration even his threat to send troops to the southern border to shut down to prevent that caravan from coming in [noise]\nWell I share the president's frustration at the Democrats are obstructing on this issue I represent as southern border district eighty miles in the border I chaired the border security subcommittee and we've got fifth generation ranchers down there on the border right now\nDealing with the cartel activity continuing to traffic opioids and other drugs and human trafficking indirect communities\nAnd this is a public safety and the national security issue we also have like in the town of ... the city of Yuma\nIf that number of people that are being trafficked by the cartels taking advantage of the loop holes in our laws so that they know they're going to be released right into the interior of the United states never to show up for their court date and this is not going to where he just doesn't isn't working on my bill that I worked really closely with the White House on\nClosing loopholes only Congress can do it so that the minister Asian can enforce the law and make sure that we secure our border financial across Arizona\nCongresswoman before you supported what was known as the good lab bell you supported another billing twenty Fifteen your opponent says that you're on all sides of this issue because in the bill you supported in twenty Fifteen you opposed the the funding\nDACA and in fact you supported a path to citizenship for the dreamers so what about the argument goes in front of them makes that you've been inconsistent on this issue\nBut Chris you understand the legislative process I been consistently leading on this issue at the border security subcommittee ... isn't a difficult issue but when the president kick the doctor to Congress appropriately we work together Goodlatte McCall Labrador myself to lead to identify a solution\nAnd that's what they're doing I mean these are people carrying on they're carrying in their own country many\nCities are people who want a better future and they have to look at my mom came down the street and occupy your home because you know the nicer home today do you wouldn't say oh gosh I really feel sorry for you to be pretty angry that they were occupying you're on the average person look there are a Gallup survey a hundred and Seventy nine million people\nIn Latin America would like to come to the United states so at what point do we draw a number on when you draw the number I don't care how big it is I suppose you can say oh I'll take twelve million ... is she going to control the border machines and going to I\nThink we have to control our border I've never been against that are on but I think using this issue I thought that was the question I as an election not a campaign theme I think is is is very cynical we\nWish there were more Democrats in Congress today because there's nothing that partnership actually secure the\nBorder now well I was in I Would hate for years\nI Wish I Wish there were any Democrats platoon Congress to [noise]\nWhat does that mean [laughter] I mean they're all to the left and works on the left and where she wants to do agree with that\nI certainly will dramatically to the left\nI think both parties have lost the center and both parties are governed more from the um the the further out the Iraq going to call them extreme\nAnd it's a huge loss for good governance I just remember in Nineteen Ninety four penny case it I don't know if you're involved in that John ... and Tim Penny that a Democrat now an independent led an effort\nTo provide for a responsible budget cuts we got up to a hundred million dollars including defense cuts in I represented a defense dependent essay and an almost passed and then we all are an a banded together with you and President Clinton to pass a a balanced budget amendment Nineteen Ninety seven\nThat I don't know when I got it I Know a guy I was\nJust going to jump in I mean I one of the ironies of this Arizona race that we're focusing on for Senate is a trip to members current members of Congress are actually fairly middle of the road in the way they conduct themselves in Congress actually work together\nOn healthcare for now at each other's throats in the most are the two for the terms possible Martha McSally calling ... crater it appears to two or something and and that just shows that um even when people kind of have\nA moderate record they find themselves forced by the political circumstances to repudiate that and seem even more extreme than they actually have governors\nSo right I I Know you're not going to play ball but I'm going to ask the other three are quickly starting with you mark who's going to win the house\nI think the Democrats are more likely to hold out but think of Nancy Pelosi speaker with Maxine Waters that Adam Schiff for chairman of the best thing to work it out presents reelection twenty twenty congresswoman Democrats\nBy a small margin and I hope they have a vision for our future\nBut you don't know I Hope it's about a vision and speaker or they don't really go to Kevin McCarthy will be the next week for not supposed to be\nThere you go All right thank you and I ...

that's eight seven seven five for eight seven to three three [noise]\nAll right uh a very unique man ... Taleb I think I'm pronouncing that right has some a compelling ideas on the the subject of measuring risk\nA talent as a in a middle aged man of Greek a background from a prominent family in Lebanon and uh he's ... he was educated here in the United states he's an author scholar mathematics professor philosopher senior Wall Street trader and hedge fund manager and\nHe's an expert on mathematical science [laughter]\nA pretty smart guy sounds like a yeah that that's quite a mouthful and and saying that description or really hardly begins to describe him\nA Talib is is a formidable thinker and when he speaks he draws large crowds as you can imagine his most famous books are the hidden role of chance\nFooled by randomness and the black swan the impact of the highly improbable\n[noise] now you will not need to run out and buy these books and read them cover to cover although you could let me tell you what he has to say because it has profound meeting for you and me and really profound impact on the ideas of the everyday investor [noise]\nHe said that we all place too much weight on the odds that past events will repeat when on repeatable chance is a better explanation\n[noise] do you assume that the markets will continue to always go up that any downturns are temporary that bull markets continue forever or you do not even think about the risks\nEither way danger lies ahead Taleb a argues that the markets do not factor interests that are not measurable and that and most of the really big events in our world are rare unpredictable and not measurable\nThese advanced when that happened usually have a very significant downward impact on the investment markets are you probably remember what happened um on nine eleven of two thousand one\nTotally unpredictable\n[noise] but this is one of the ... the very big reasons why we spent so much time encouraging you to get off of that train and shift the risk to someone else\nShift the risk to whom we work with a billion

billion dollar companies willing to guarantee you a lifetime income provides\nA lot of comfort a lot of a relief and a lot of peace of mind for my clients [noise]\nBut uh back to ... have you heard the term black swan event or that term is what he calls these events that are rare and unpredictable\nThe term refers to seventeenth century idea\nAnd tell the sixteen hundreds it wasn't accepted truth that all swans are white in fact ... are white had been used for a long time as the standard example of a scientific truth\nThe equivalent today might be the earth rotates around the sun today would call that an indisputable scientific truth\nSo what were the odds of seen a black swan at that time\nWell impossible to calculate but are considered impossible until sixteen Ninety seven when explores found black swans and Australia imagine that they had a black swan event finding black swans and Australia when that was considered impossible\nAs I mentioned earlier we had a black swan event in two thousand one didn't wait [noise]\nWalking back socialism news radio was Casey okay he's done so late fees the industry should do and this is march of Nineteen Ninety seven so only view or there's\nBeen some of you listen to me from the very beginning some of your new listeners and so I really appreciate this time it's fairly new so I really appreciate you telling your friend friends and families will help him\nAnd I have a one of the best doctors in anti medicine this part of the country is also a specialist and painting that's what he started out in a news actually ... before he became an MD and then before him as another five years become into\nA functional medicine doctor on top of them the so\nDr Frank appreciate you being with us and\nSpeaking of paying a lot of people were in it I once was in it I herniated my back when I was playing football and I was in the Olympic weightlifting\nOr back in the sixties wasn't about what you could be the person so much you can put over your head\nI was good at it but I didn't have a coach and I was doing a lot of dumb things so uh I Know what it feels like and I know that they thought I should operate on my back but I did not break I visually go back to some pretty good\nSo dark thank you for being with someone that has your background what do you do how do you approach people things like that\nWell that's a great question Dan and your your personal experience as much like mine with a degenerative disc problems and you know this past week actually almost every week in my clinic I have somebody\nThat will come to me and it may be their back problems like that and the orthopedic doctor will show them an MRI scans they say you at budging desk that's pushing on your nerve and so we need to go in there and operate or they might the man and their knees have been bothering them and they have an X ray or they have an MRI rushed into their knees and\nAnd the doctor will say say your bone on Bo the only thing left to do is replaced those names\nUm and and then another common one probably would be people that have shoulder injury and the doctor say yeah you have a rotator cuff tear we need to go in and operate unstable that or you know somehow repair that and\nAnd what I Would say bear in mind not only was acupuncture and before medicine but I'm I'm also an anesthesiologist so I've taken thousands of patients to the operating room with your doctors and the general surgeons and so forth\nAnd the good news is is that really most of the time\nUh these things can be addressed through the original stem cell therapy that regenerate healthy structure so that you support the back and it's not putting pressure on the the ... and so forth it's it's\nIt's regenerating a healthy rotator cuff and in fact it's actually regenerating healthy cartilage within the knees so the vast majority of these patients eighty eighty five percent will not need surgery that can regenerate new healthy structure\n... through the stem cell activation of furlough therapy\nThat's interesting because I Would have thought at one time uh that if you have bona bone cartilage very hard thing to generally speaking to regenerate because of the much blood flow and it's great to know that you can actually do that\nYeah well with with ... therapy the original stem cell therapy uh eighty eighty five percent will regenerate healthy cartilage within a short series of four to six treatments\nThat is pretty amazing that is very amazing folks remember that you're going to be if you don't have the problem you're going to talk to someone uh I'm at the gym a lot and so I'm always talking to someone that has a new problem to know that they can actually do that without having to have surgery on it\nUh because a lot of time surgery like especially the shoulder road take up they'll cut into the shoulder in the snow real food will be drain and it may never come back\nIt wants to it so even though they may have saved the you know the top of the humorous or something in there it's still has a problem a ... after ... doesn't have it right away but after a few weeks it might be worse than it was before ... scar tissue is now build up so\nWhat do you know how do you deal with rotator cuff you actually find out which I'm ... tendon of the muscles not working and you go in and since it's a inject that and get the Simpson co working on that is that how you doing\nYeah not not only that you know we examine the shoulder stand your culture or superior lateral wait we examined the shoulder or in a very detailed passion and they're often not just the rotator cuff but other associated tendons and ligaments that may be\nA weekend for injury and and so we treat all of those ... therapy which is the original stem cell therapy and and so the solution we put into the treatment is going to stimulate the patients very own stem cells to come in and he'll and repair those structures\nI is really cool I mean the idea that you know at one time folks I may live as a physical therapist based on exercise equipment I did it\nAnd uh if I got someone before ... shoulder surgery a lot of times I've been saving the surgery ... many times on knee surgery but if I got an afterwards on the shoulder it was much harder\nBecause of the drain in the snow real flu and the scar tissue and everything so I'm really excited that idea that not only a you know that you can get a ... you can get a person back to normal and saving the surgery which used to not even be considered and I know when I had a bulging disc and my low back\nAnd my lumbar showed up almost like bone on the X ray or there was so tight\nBack then I think they thought the only thing you do for the surgery\nYeah and you know they're not it's not that we have bad doctors that's what they're trying to do is to operate the good news is is that\nA through a more integrative approach looking at the they a conventional as well as the alternative there are alternatives out there and pro therapy as one of the\nUh most profound therapy as we haven't been around for eighty five years and more in America I'm you know I I did many many thousands of epidural steroid injections through the years but once I trained in in ... therapy\nOr you know I helped a lot of people with us but they they didn't do anything to actually regenerate healthy structure like stem cell therapy does well\nIn a way they can actually cause harm especially if you get to watch is soften up the the bones and everything but I used to be the only thing they had and so it's great to have these alternatives now doc tell people how to get a hold of you\nWell the clinic's ... sixty five ah cell site's boulevard in Edmond in office number seven six three seven six zero three and a
