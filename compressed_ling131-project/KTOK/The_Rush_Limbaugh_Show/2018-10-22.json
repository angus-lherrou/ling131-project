media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\n\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up and with\nPeople down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just\nWant to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are\nPredominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective\nOn this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white ... infant didn't want it but last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there so you about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them in their not publicly saying this but I Know that there there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything\nIf this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that would do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right\nWhere they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if it's if some\nRepublicans are behind this than the there's obvious uh but I just somebody has\nTo be somebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden undecided\nAll of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles we don't see\nPictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people chewing things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams of what the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with ...\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how\nMany miles a day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest\nFor the next day that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those are real Linda that's over for three months\n[noise] and the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven\nThousand and the word is it may

it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October

some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizes the care of it by the way the [noise]\nThe details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night\nHow is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening especially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind would want this who when their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat\nEver motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and form you know having a fall push on securing the border\nOn Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of house off this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nThey're being driven solely by emotion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having I may I ask a bunch of experiences\n\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just a race to the border and say to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense take a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nThe shiny new bike your kids have been asking

people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business a drop of a distraction is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned about this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say\nWell you can use the military because a positive comments out is look\nThat normally prevent some military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military just stopping invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou would dare you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't it what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think that people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God is trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized border if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people plan this thing\nExactly and that's where it can't try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else's but I'm a little I get them on hey bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is it a whole lot of different ways\nWill be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get away with it off\nTo Russia by be Mitt work use radio one down\nVoters have a choice on

public in\nOkay All right so let's let's let's walk through this\nAnd give you a names if I Want it to oh yeah we're going to lose the house the objective now is to make sure we hold the Senate\nHow long is it going to take how many how many\nCycles how many years is it going to take for our side to realize the media is jamming them every day that the media is making it up the media and the pollsters and whoever else have an agenda and they're servicing it every day\nI Can't tell you the number of guys I've talked to [noise] [noise] oh yeah there's no\nWay we hold the house rush why why do you think well maybe the polling data why are you believing it\nI I've asked them point blank how many people want to run into who you know voted for Trump wish they had a nobody exactly my point how many people do you know who voted for Trump claim\nThat the Democrats need to win now because Trump has to be stopped and all this tweeting has to be stopped and all these bad manners have to be a nobody\nSo why do you think the way I saw it on I mean I saw it on TV I see the polls why do you believe it\nWhere is the trend that Democrats are winning elections\nSeventy\nSeven thousand people have signed up to get into the Trump rally in Texas for crews that whole Seventeen thousand people\nWhere do you get this idea Democrats are popular\nIn the game was ... years in the afternoon and five other news radio on now is on the field day [noise]\nI'm Sorry it's not Seventy seven thousand is one hundred thousand people RSVP in for a chance to see the Trump cruise rally\nThe venue Seventeen or Eighteen thousand people are\nLining up twenty four hours in advance of folks a little common sense or this is Texas and remember to drive by told us that Beto O'Rourke\nWas the answer to me in the early days rock rib conservative Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke\nHe's love by everybody outside Texas thirty eight million dollars he raised in a quarter except there's a problem and that is it Ted Cruz has been creeping ahead in even the\nPolling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real and yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke [noise] gonna be the guy and it can take a Ted Cruz has anybody\nFound a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have a venue that whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people to want to get in that is not the kind of thing that happens\nWith a ... a political party that is losing losing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies you know I don't oppose this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in the in the Phoenix area\nAnd if the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going through it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be they sent me a video that they took their iPhone tennis max\nDriving along the entire a line in order to make the video fit\nTo be in a size they could email it to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note this is that this doesn't even\nShow that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get and how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side\nMeanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds of ... these ...\nThese kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner on harassed them\n\nThe turtle and his wife are at a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky and some mad cap asinine\nProtesters shows up and just start shouting things a turtle just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything\nThe other patrons in the restaurant or just watching all this go by this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such A M the weight loss of loyalty and so forth\nAnd it this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democrats' side whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not\nThe things you associate with winning it's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook these are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\n... the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show your those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture seven thousand people or what\nIs said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have march jump through Mexico mad walk out committed they are most people are really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n\nMost often they remain aware of\nAround about his ground Jewish or\nSome of this must be based on\nAssociations more to the\nPhones\nMost of the the bail us out or when the weather that is where we're at our best news radio one thousand Katie okay\n[noise]\nOkay back to the phones we go to a certain Wilton and Macon\nGeorgia great to have you with us on the E R B network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about well that's great have you here\nHe thinks the reason why I called I spend a lotta years military are retired from the older we are very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we not good at so this situation that look I I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about ... this is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people\nThat are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're going to get your your sort of very good at it but\nThat wouldn't be enough to okay what about this what about just the president here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and the end\nOf the problem that's the perilous form of the problem\nWe're about you know you and your ... your ears bullet you use a ... one of the dummy is called I forgot the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nAnd we have a variety of different things you but you know all it takes one person going down to squeal like a pig and then there's ... ... we just have to follow up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president's would be tremendous\nBut the president would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong and interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lowe's Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good that they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nNow that's the ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation for you to have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not it may it may sound in since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line at probably what Bush which or talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two gotta hit them with storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and\nIt essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength and we just have to\n... even if there is a casualty or to the drive by their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd they're still peril yeah okay so the alternative is still a lot of men\nNope nope I have to hold a lot it and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to take one for the change the political legalized asleep it's unfortunate but this is what they this is what they take it all by taking this just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio\nRain again you're listening to the mid ... radio one thousand Katie okay [noise]\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home prone to my area in the handle any kind of project you can read a review the check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that home advisor completely free to you\nGo home at ... dot com boy download the ... to get started\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage or well our investment advice is about to you it's about providing your kids with opportunities for a head start in life viewing secure and your retirement in ... in your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you\nThe path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your news people financial advisor ... dot com that's S C I F E L people make wasn't company incorporated member S.

are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time in their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story ... all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now by showed up to do a rallying for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he debated round the census last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of you in an Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion that guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as a collective\nNo that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or all collective he hit it would be a disaster for Florida right now is well liked anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you live in Florida and Texas economies are growing like gang busters and you and it's not just because of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy Florida and Texas have no state income\nTax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd\nYou didn't build that you didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and here Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackles a whole bunch of emergencies in disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a just a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever left his leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit the Florida or not\nBut the Santa would be great defense is is a is a Reagan night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nHere and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have are\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt wouldn't constitute rolling back\nEvery achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe wave stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats\nI Can't I Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off\nOn this attempt at transforming America into being something\nThat it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be\nDetermined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nParty you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrats\nAnd he wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes it happen or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own field trips to the Democrat Party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of ... means spirited\nExtremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what's psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way\nI mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the exact\nTotal wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these
