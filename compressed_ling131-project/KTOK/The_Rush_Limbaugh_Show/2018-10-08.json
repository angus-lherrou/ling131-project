not folks that I've that I don't I don't want to fall back on that the suggested this ah anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that

the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side and making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program in the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old several judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws in America they have to rely on activists jobs just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Jews or before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion\nThe American people haven't decided that that was forced on the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need activist\nJudges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every that this is the point\nWhat they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests it's\nThe same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nIf Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you running ... he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexandria or if you're going to ask\nWho is one of the on display in a left his district in New York is harmless but you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively are you left\nUs you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot reveal\nThis everything they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country the country has been bludgeon into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nTry to ruin you or they bully us\nOr they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if

do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life for private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledged that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products will power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nAnd then in fact in this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported Kavanaugh and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it it scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men they have sons they have brothers and anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind\nJust see the Democratic party had a line itself in such a way\nThat men work or don't Matt ... lake guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable in fact\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point may the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is in is a woman making the point\nThat Kavanaugh is as good as guilty because he\nCould have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball Z forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with\nThe sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss what is\nTranspiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nThat someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we tromp through cannot who has put some ... on the final Republican\nOr ... true true but\nMaybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just the we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was\nWidely publicized and Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make he rose out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate boat when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people down to the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue color class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these types of issues but I think largely that that the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get ... get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats are just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but\nThat's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this monkey ... for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case for\nDemocrats think they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election the Democrats think the whole country is because if they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think\nThat they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout\nThere is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the the event had happened and what twenty nine days let it happen\nA true yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox say a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by the end actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet [laughter] I just add the tropical [noise] um\nSo I can I can see with the passage just be you cannot main theme this\nRiver passion for long nobody can welded but we're

the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here\nThe U.S Supreme Court had to step in and stop it because it was out of control and when they did the Democrats were fit to be tied and from that day forward and George W. Bush was an illegitimate president and he didn't stop being a legitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the money's\nSix years later\nIn the middle of his second term so\nWe get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have\nTo pay that country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back\nAnd they are going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and that Al Gore being duly recognize as the legitimate winner of the presidency\nEven though Al Gore didn't want to be part of it by that time\nThey were feeling so up so shore so confident\nThat when it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial\nHonoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone\nIt was about three weeks [laughter] prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand two\nThe Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a pure Paul lyrical rally\nThe purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone Republican senators who were friends of Wellstone who's doing if we showed up\nAt the arena they did this arena place it holds Fifteen thousand people with my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after a while most of them died in the plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was I don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial anyway Republican senator is not knowing up from dominance on Trent Lott and the boys\nAll showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial a religious memorial ... there for one colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm food and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having arrived in sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the worthy Republicans receded in getting in their faces and pointing fingers at 'em and Boeing after they thought they were there\nTo participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left and this memorial turned in\nTo a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W ... a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven\nFor this memorial this Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve\nAnd I remember I was invited as the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted\nAnd I went and I was\nNot on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycles other people through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans hadn't gained ... seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big\nBecause\nThe Democrats told it everybody hated Bush everybody resented the wave of Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just like a week and the the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and in competence and as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats didn't take back control of what is rightfully\nTheirs Washington DC except it didn't happen to Republicans gained ... seats Tim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said the Wellstone memorial\nBut Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why in a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked they were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections is the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me\nAnd if it's I like ... if it's happened once it can happen again something that hasn't happened before probably won't happen buddy of mine has then it can happen again and this is a replay of that\nExcept this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior but we'll still memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display four to four years\nAnd ... longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent years of public the arrangement\nPublic insanity psychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too have sat in the Senate gallery as a young boy my parents took my brother and me in Washington DC one summer\nAnd the Senate was in session and I'll Remember a Barry Goldwater was among the senators speaking when we were there he was speaking on the farm bill [noise] I was fourteen or Fifteen\n\nAnd I remember being in the gallery and I had a it was a pamphlet book some some kind of a a manual explaining what the Senate was and what was going on and I was turning the pages and the Senate page came and grabbed that book away from\nMe and said you are making too much noise I'll give you this back after you leave just turning up page was not permitted the gallery could not do anything more than ...\nYou were not allowed to chew gum people were\nChewing gum and the pages said you're leaving Russia or putting it in a piece of paper and tossing and you're not staying in here to income\nThey would come what spurred this to you they took my little pamphlet a way\nI felt like they just stop all just come and then I'm watching this thing the other night in these in these these these these women are going batty\n\nSounding literally like they are infants out of the loan that and they don't want to be there and I\nCouldn't even make out what they're saying it sounded like Christian Adams said it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there and Tom my

back to Bill Clinton and and the accusations that came out against\nIn the early days of my mouth out early but very a faulty\nAccusations with him on the media Saturday Night live ah every talk show on the news outlets they totally destroy these women they lead follow their looks than the other way\nTheir mosques are stories of the fake discredit them they questioned the motives on what Dr more were uh you have someone that doesn't remember anything you have\nVictims of remember in particular leader for all the time the place to who what where when with with um the army is so disgusting and there's no political motive\nWith with Bill Clinton's victims because there were members of his own party\nAnd that's the sickness of all this and I think the senators and this whole process now have perfect\nWeapon use ah and I have to call it a weapon for the perfect reality slap is to bring this up and and and call it out I mean a polo see Schumer I'm a turban and number of them won't even take a call from would need a ... a member of their own party\nYeah but they said they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there\nBecause they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe bossy\nBut the fact of the matter is and I will say it again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault\nAs evidenced by your recitation of the facts of what happened to women
