I think they've been caught big time and I Rachel Mitchell if I have the time I I've just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she could be destroyed or the credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody is going to try to get past this or through this with out any any\nChallenging or Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech pattern I look I'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work a voice\nCapabilities voice talents [laughter] excuse me again art ... gotten it out there that time we'll see\nAre a specialty of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress in a highly ...\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on mercilessly [noise]\nSo we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\n... anybody personal server ... tiny about fat ... ball that's that's how I found an hour at the ... even ...\nI talk about why and my pockets of that in my hand I found out about tobacco gr policy [noise]\nHow how her as far as ... even now I'm back\nOn ...

I don't know why the president that\nHe did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore August says um investigated and put it but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's desert even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine ball the board there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is playing out the flaws in Hurst\nWhich should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge her because it just wasn't\nSmart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the lies or the difference is the ... she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all they did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin I'm covered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year the New York times and it's been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you\nDo not see in the report anybody want to take a guess what I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint\nIt was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a point in storage\nTrump was it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zeroed not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump but he got rich from is that\nActually a reference for somebody somebody and changes are seen mostly are too young to remember\nA bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people to Saudi and said don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy Paula Jones\nYou never know what you got to do when you got to be able to print it by like what you want to come up with what you're gonna come to you going to come up with the women like New Hampshire greatest ... not a bill\nClinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial that it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kavanaugh protester with confronted I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kavanaugh where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with programmed robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushback but it's a lost cause on the protestors\nProtestors not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast a no no would you like an on corroborated charge destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protester\nHold on wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up Cassidy you know it's unfair protest I Would fight and I would make sure women heard clearly you're okay for rapist goes under the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not but then on\nAnd her hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for laughs\nSo what does this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind me years naive and the media would want to talk I thought that there were really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happening\nThat somebody has to have much to say at rush public ... being met for abuse radio London\nI'm ...

yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility\nIt makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't say Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements\nInto what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at at the moon to\nThe right to oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique if they trumped\nDeveloped I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans habits Trump has Trump has a ... that after\nHe makes an initial statement on something and he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it that cannot tell you what helped me irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months ... gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked multi for Trump didn't\nHe just simply pushy she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel and ...\nBeing joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine a man organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\n\nWell rush or a million women or nor do their research we well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not\nAbout even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and they've been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of ... and her story\n[noise]\nThe Trump doing what he's doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of

welcome back Rush Limbaugh the network books to your ear is the IRS the James with them to the gym and guarantee quote from a national\nReview or the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk of grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no\nProblem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare\nMoments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that ... or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this is well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought\nBe said to be but it never was a and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democrat Party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate that's sick it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening\nHere and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching as it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think\nWith black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nAh all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this the Democratic\nParty is the organizing party the collection agency for all of\nThese compliance Democrat Party he's happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they all ... and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not now Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine balls before\nAnd here it is they do is they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump\nTrumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all\nAbout do you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they vote or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right you can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people to hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done such outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed greatest speak to you again a right to have your back yet\nCan be out again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the cabinet firings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy that's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me\nTo me you know you had to draw on CNN while the other like couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number can't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo get away ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was right when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant capturing McKenna and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing is bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine [noise] yeah ... ... by the way here's this ... you're also random it's not all\nWomen but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include women women\nOn across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls e for this whole thing not her specific maybe I'd look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let his nominee\nNeed be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on the lake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christine Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's\nJust many screwed it mccaskey and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay\nWell ladies and gentlemen I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but there are no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat big reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo\nAfter having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened a ten point\nLead over hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell would wimp out\nOr that some Republican senators would win out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nLook at words these three Heitkamp Donald Les McCann what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion and high camp have all been hoping that Collins caves\nThat maybe even McConnell would cave and Murkowski when cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states there's hell to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford and I want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\n\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented the power\nLine reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with especially in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic it created a chart in essence\nBased on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it\nIs the dates to varying dates the different dates of the ... event Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second\nHis question why the sudden change within a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt the charge here and try not to try and served a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some\nUh some bars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents in the therapists\nNotes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text message to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nIn her letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\nThe hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school all summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she sent it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that\nBefore she and said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties early eighties high school\nEarly eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes that her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred\nIn the summer of eighty two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that President alert or your phones and ... yeah I forgot to warn people that does it to a team that day there
