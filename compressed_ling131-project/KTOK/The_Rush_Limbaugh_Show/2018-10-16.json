drank and uh when we walked out I'm not going to give away anything but it happens in his home in the garage with the last couple of scenes\nAnd you know it's it's kind of the climax of the

talking about it as a big time Oscar movie have you seen what does it first in the first man first man have you seen that I haven't um though I'm fascinated by these sort of cultural controversy around surrounding the movie ... which I mean we talked about when the story came out\nThat they didn't put the scene of them planting the flag and the moon right I'm In the movie which is the iconic moment of this story\nI mean but the the the argument was a ... is showing is making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches of the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rockets and the and the flag on the you know the the lunar lander what's the problem\nRight it's an odd choice I thought you know it's the iconic moment about movie why wouldn't you put it in the movie\nAnd it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man that's another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah um but we now uh now I have not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and first of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they can cite that you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is likely just a patch or ... yeah which which you kind of understand would be really obvious if they tell you what it's not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag planted in the mood in the background but it was already been planted there and they show it if they were voting the flag they just don't say to that moment\nNot good enough what if those forty year old women are they like has handed\nAgain and I was there all it is somebody

Warren's Cherokee heritage\nWhy why he does this matter I mean you know again we have the Saudi Arabia thing going on that as much more important I mean not to mention that we are going to hit a trillion dollars in debt again\nFor this year another trillion dollars in debt there's no sign of that letting up despite the fact that we're in a good economy were were were popping out a trillion plus on the books when unemployment rate is almost at full employment or almost at the peak of our employment situation\nWe are at a point where we are the stock market despite a couple of bad days this week\nA has been raging for a very long time\nA housing prices are up everything you know everything is ... pointing in the right direction and we're still throwing a trillion dollars on the fire [noise]\nJust put this up to this new banner from CNN the disappearance of journalists puts spotlight on Trump's business ties him that he is because candidate Trump talked about uh uh doing business with the Saudi Arabian yes he's talked about that for very long my gosh are you kidding me now\nThe only reason why they care about the Saudi Arabians they forget about you forget about gas prices forget about the economy forget about the tech sector forget about all of that\nThis is just another way for them to talk about Donald Trump\nPlay that game just don't play that game I Wish I cared about anything in the world as much as you get an cares about what\nDonald Trump tweets I mean there are absolutely chemically obsessed with this meant they are it's it's incredible they're chemically

announces this\n\nSo she is one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of empty and DNA why is there not much Indian DNA out there or was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only envy and DNA so he felt the need to expand it\nDoing clue in South America when other reason there isn't much in the\nDNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will\nTell you they don't use DNA to determine the lineage they use genealogical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical pray organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\n\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA\nIf any of this but ... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except British inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kitten with wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate future debate\nAnd that's what he meant that she wouldn't do any better that she wouldn't show up at the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people who lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party ... out in the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion\nAnd my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave\nThere's no question about it there has been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of\nDonald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of\nVoting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world\nUsing common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq who's saying all in two thousand ten\n[noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand fourteen midterms\nOur party gets those but Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely by holding steady in the spine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment of Kevin all the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified twenty four of them\nSay they want to be president now [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThe mayor's

party Elizabeth Warren tweeted ... different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter\nBut I Know a lot of people who are and in the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nTwenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on us just DNA did not actually use samples of Native American DNA\nThe Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for native\nAmericans now she's out there touting that it's true or she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth [noise]\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to ... it is the static and I think\nThis is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton was making a fool of herself ... they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no that was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband who are soon to be barking ...\nStadium chore or yes\nBill and Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium tour where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged doesn't like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do what anybody can do it they're going to try to\nGet in on it there's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going\nTo say there's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had I've never really the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe wake of\nDonald Trump you know what does it like it was it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years so there's pros and Gary Hart pants\nSome ... some ... the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave her radio show or the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who had never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never\nHas happened every attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds that they want that you may think rush them enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that\nWhat we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people in\nThe country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this\nThis notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the Google rule David analyst on the left who used to be at the New York times and then he went to

brought\nL T each service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou its its\nMaximum twenty yards is

twenty five yards and most of what should be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch was recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there

recording it doesn't start yeah it can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the ... there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or\nEven on the phone it\nWell the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in ranging connected to the

for Halloween is yours on the last couple of those efforts by Matthew Brady\nAnd welcome back okay somebody asked me a good question about they watch the apple watch worn by ... [noise] rush one about ... a good question [noise] the way why fine on the apple watch works\nIs this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThough the watch is always a slave to the phone so the the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is ... it's connectivity is determined by your phone so if your phone is using ... to connect\nOr even L. T. E. or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by Bluetooth\nIf the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on a wife I network the watch\nIs capable of why but only if\nThe iPhone that it's paired June knows that wide network\nFor example when I'm at home um I leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connect via wife by\nBecause my phone is connected the wife ... and the watch learns it but I still I have to manually answer\nThe why fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the uh the password from the phone to watch\nIt took me a while to figure that amounts of walking the dogs and the watches connecting unable to eat or some kind of lifestyle over in this state what the hell's going on so I checked and I found out that I had not edited the password for my wife I network on my watch\nWhat I doubt that\nYour mouth to show these phone had why fi connection to the Saudi consulate\nIf it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife I network in there but if she doesn't know the password that phone's not going to connect to the Saudi wife I end up the phone doesn't connect to what the watch will\nNot\nNow if he had a history of going into that consulate with his phone and if one of previous visit he had logged into their wife I network with a password then his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered\nThe wife I network password on his watch that just for the phone is not nearby\nI just don't think any of that happened I don't know how proficient this guy was with tech it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything\nOn why fight if he had actually answered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch\nJust because the the phone has has been logged on what the password does not mean to watch as\n\nEvery device connecting to a wife I met were half to go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got really simplified here you know you'll people may not know this ... and may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncles IQ sauce\nAnd uncles IQ as a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the password to his wife you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do is make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever wherever you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find the wife I network at the minute you do that ... phone will get his alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and my uncles equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are the guest them as they will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as an Iowa eleven\nYou should try to see if you don't notice [noise]\nIt's fascinating it's it's uh it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify oldest\nBut I'm just telling you that ... would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulates ... on his watch even if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife ... worker access at\nIf he'd done that if his watch worked on why fight in that conflict than he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\nOr what the current wife I Know it it it it it because he's the pardon me out of range for it but but it would still need the password still need\nA [laughter] well I don't know if they would say no or not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this visit was probably will find devotee okay who knows but I doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nFrom whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case um\nBook yet another example of try to explain this you go to a city and you get in a car picks you up at the airport or whatever and the car service has wife I it it it's just a hot spot\nThe driver gives you the password if you're not sure you log into it you're watching is not logging on to the network your ... your watch is connecting to the phone", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "16"}
