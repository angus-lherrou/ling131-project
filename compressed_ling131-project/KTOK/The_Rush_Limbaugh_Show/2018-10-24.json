mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think in all ... what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn mad I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative\nAnd you've watched everything blow up on your your watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you\nIf all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing up\nOn you and it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harassed and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense\nTo show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much\nApparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do not words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just spreading

of that work if all of that\nBackfired and ball leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you cannot

lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it [noise] okay let's get some of the election analysis them in terms are Thirteen Days away two weeks\nAgo from yesterday Tom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics that was among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of\nPolls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site\nReal clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... co founder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the\nTop of it here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they haven't real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave\nIf a wave was coming it would be building he says and it\nIsn't\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything\nThere's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how we described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor\nTrump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate\nSide ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\n\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise]\nAnd Trump is a

why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks for pollsters now that the mainstream media does this every election cycle where\nIt was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by\nTrump and that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to beat curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply\nIn the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls picked it up\nOr at least some of it\nIt's a good reminder that even mid October surveys mislaid change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen\nAgain it probably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg's a but it did in ... and it's going either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose big it going to ... what what is old isn't decision all of a sudden\nVersus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n[noise]\nPolls couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown

on their radar\n\nSo no I mean how are they are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterms the Clinton now is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what are the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar\nExcept they are today I mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour\nThird team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people to come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and\nTalk about politics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale at every event here yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now at Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with somebody left just tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred and so much anger life in America is not say that just it's just too packed it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what in form\n... and a educated suspicion about this would tell

stoop to everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge

Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\n\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on

that around\nWould it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way they thought\nDo not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that that that's attached to this\nIs not going the way they have a short us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this\nThis mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab Lee a tweet here is really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary ...\nYeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kinda thing right\nYeah it was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already plan to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good piece and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons at great professor called the ... rush he taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no ah are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy\nTheorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have you'd never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're ... you're right about the Clinton is there are no coincidence is with them as soon as I say this was a philosophy that I have a stalled for four years on this program asking people to never forget\nThere are no coincidence and live and the fact you know you say that these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary or Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar\nBut see that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately\nNeed to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirt I used to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth from I Would

Miller\nAn FBI agent looking into city corruption who is posing as a developer they've been looking into ... Andrew Gillum corruption as mayor of Tallahassee for years and there were a lot of Democrats are very worried that this was going to come out if he'd\nGet indeed win the primary fights and become the Democratic nominee which\nHas happened that the Sanders campaign pounced to see Republicans always pounds in the media Republicans pounds Democrats David but Republicans ... ...\nIt's now abundantly clear goes that the scientists statement that the Andrew Gillum has repeatedly lied about taking free gift and trips from lobbyists to feel lie about these gifts in trips in lobbyists on national TV what else\nIs he lying about once a close friend of ... this Corey Feldman is at the center of the FBI's long running investigation into corruption in Tallahassee\nNo one's been charged with anything and Gillum has said that agents assured him he was neither a target nor a focus of the probe just like call me told Trump\nGillum has repeatedly given vague answers to questions about who paid for the New York city trip is avoidance of a direct answer became pronounce during his Sunday debate on CNN with the census and Gail I'm just saying this essay multiple you pay for the handle the tech is not\nA lot of people why if it's a big deal okay a trip to New York Hamilton tickets big guy won't tell the truth about is the big ... up\n\nBut I think this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change is wrong thing to say because it is a window into he'll Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power\nInto positive influential goodies for himself\nHe's a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks and uh and other things things willingly a desirous of sticking them\nAnd it's a [noise]\nIn in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interests and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is ahead of just ... fifty two to forty six among the light ... voters and he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence and it's the third such poll in about a week ten days to show Gillum\nWith this clear to lead as his overall edge in public polling ... why do its largest level since October first [noise]\nOkay so ... is a character he is a person with cloud of suspicion\nThat are hanging all over him in addition to that he is a hard left wing activist tack who re first to Florida as his collective he looks things in the white communists and Marxist do\nHe does not believe in the power of the individual because that leads the inequality an unfairness\nHe wants\nEverybody to get free healthcare here and a free medical care over their Medicare for all he believes in a guaranteed national income these these kinds of things that if ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening nationwide that is building the economy\nBut who is ... is a lot of people may not know much about Ron's defenses so let me step in here and tell those of you in this vast and wide audience in Florida who he is\nRhonda ... and Harvard graduate who was a decorated jag officer in the navy judge advocate general\nHe has a solid record of winning achievements as a representative from Florida he has resigned his house seat\nIn order to devote all of his time exclusively to his campaign has got a great family his wife uh is is all in for this has got a young kid is just the [noise]\nThe epitome of a decent solid American citizen who has achieved tremendous great things\nNow on TV I think it was this morning he was on on Fox\nAnd he very calmly and very simply outlined a pattern or corruption by Andrew Gillum\nHe pointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years as they said an undercover agents to catch you breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development deals pay to play so to speak\nYum graduated from college was given awards by socialist organizations which propelled him a young age to get elected to the city commission in Tallahassee then he became mayor for three years he's been under some kind of cloud or investigation ever since he wants to Florida to be a sanctuary state\n[noise] and he wants to Florida to be open borders for any and all illegal immigrants he is the classic\nAmerican socialist to believes America is the problem in the world and the poverty in Central America and the southern hemisphere is our fault because we've all been stolen too many and too much of the world's resources and we imported at all and we have denied it to our neighbors\nWe have stolen America from the Native Americans and so forth there's nothing decent about the American founding the constitution is all out David now and the guy is a classic throwback he is\nA walking talking but rock Hussein Obama on steroids if that's even possible\n\nThey may be if you compare the current crop of Democrats can get Andrew Gillum is not unusual among the dead the Democrats are putting people like him up all over this country and in many places they are finding the blame you heard what's happening to Heidi Heitkamp did you hear what she did\nShe just [noise] I'll tell you in a minute as time unfolds here she is down third team in her Senate race she voted against Kavanaugh and then thought\nShe'd be able to recover some Republicans that got mad at her but she has blown that sky high she's just missed judged things terribly out the details are coming up I don't want to get sidetracked here the point is\nThat the Democrats are nominating quasar eyes socialists\nAnd and and people have problems with America all over this country people think America is flawed that there's no such thing as American exceptionalism or greatness and people think that our our unfairly biased and
