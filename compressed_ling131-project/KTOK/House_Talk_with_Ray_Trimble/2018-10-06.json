{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "Um so I'm a typical team and I'm not going to beat themselves um [noise] I think they have five turnovers maybe four or five miles an interception penalize forty one yards game so they don't beat themselves\nAs well I got to be talking about Iowa State and Eric he was talking about the quarter back he was ... Noland their second team guide and we're still not sure as Mike said about their normal starter but a\nNolan is a guy who could throw it around a little bit and that could present some problems uh and we'll see what the weather's going to end up being like at two thirty this afternoon\n[noise] what about Calvin bondage and Dylan stoner ... these guys hum I ... I Wish I could both of them didn't make the trip to Lawrence and I can tell you why the cowboys don't play well in ... in Lawrence it's boring [laughter] you can't get motivated in Lawrence\nYeah you don't even at the time of the year they went up there you don't even have ... village still looked at a shoulder and bondage Gandhi would not say didn't know for sure what their status would be I expect we will find out until much closer to kick off ... has an ankle or stone or has a little bit of a shoulder and a little bit of an ankle\nBut land and walk by the former walk on really stepped up uh with uh the cowboys with out both Dylan stoner an of course a jail in my class ski landing wolf in his first start ended up with over a hundred yards receiving so a a\nHeck of a game for him cowboys do have a lot of depth the wide receiver and it's a good thing\nBecause with Jay Lynn McCluskey now gone and then some injuries the cowboys are bad they're down for wide receivers but uh guys have stepped up and uh they will need to do that once again of course against Iowa State a team that\nOf course you know can cause some problems that team veto you last season and the cowboys struggled with them at times we'll see what the weather ends up doing this afternoon it's a game obviously over as you asked I have\nWith their back loaded schedule\nWith teams coming up and that Boone Pickens stadium you would certainly think the cowboys would be able to handle the psych loans fairly well they've not been beaten by Iowa State of course since the infamous game and twenty eleven the double overtime a game when the cowboys last thirty seven thirty one\nBut games lately I've been pretty close last year it was a a forty nine forty two games a year before was thirty eight thirty one year before he was thirty five thirty one year before that it was thirty seven to twenty\nSo the cowboys won all those games but they've been dog fights pretty much right down to the end there\nAnd just to ... which you you should get one out of the way to day I mean they think about that you're talking to the back loaded schedule but what she was five and one I still ultimately don't know how how\nOklahoma State fans feel about this team and fiber one considering that one laws which just so horrific to Texas Tech and if you were to put a from a scale of one to ten the confidence level that that shoe fans have on this team\nTo finish strong this year and have a pretty good season where does it where does it stand right now\nWhile the confidence to finish strong because their schedule is so strong coming down the stretch is probably right now rounded up five or six\nOr because of the schedule is so difficult and I think there's still a lot of questions out there about Taylor Cornelius and about the offensive line and what's gonna happen with these two guys\nWho are injured Calvin bondage and Dylan stoner and Darren Daniels on the defensive line that standing defensive tackle all sort is now out for the rest of the season so the cowboys do have some injuries situations and so I think that's kind of where you put the confidence level\nPeople just aren't exactly sure how things are going to play out but I'd like to er Cornelius had a much better game and ride it was against Kansas\nBut at the office of line played a little better like Mike said we'll see they'll have a little more\nStern test with a Iowa State but another good game that builds on your confidence of your Taylor Cornelius and that much and I think that's very important for them right now\nOh coming matchups with West Virginia Texas and Oklahoma still on the schedule\nOh yeah I I see you you know all I gather schedule is back loaded it'll be tough well talking about the rest of the big twelve as we move forward when we come back this is game day Saturday on the oh and then\nWhen bad things happen Richard more set attorney law provides experienced integrity and

every for more of the game they got an a\nLawyer as we look at the big twelve scheduled today a Texas do you do your Texas a you've talked about it quite a bit but it is unquestionably the headline game in the conference this weekend\nAnd maybe all of college football college game day down in Dallas this week for this one and you've just you've got an opportunity really here for for both of these schools for Oklahoma you move to six to know if you win this game they share you put yourself in position to\nHave the college football playoff select committee which there should be talking about you now but we'll be talking about you a lot more obviously the more wins you can rack up this year and you may need all the help you can get a bureau you didn't the margin of error this year may not be as wide as it has been in years past with Notre Dame\nSort of hanging out there and continuing to pile up wins and everybody talks about an undefeated Notre Dame\nI think it was last Notre Dame team should also be very scary to the power five conferences if they have been ... if the select committee has an opportunity to put the med but for Texas\nThis is your opportunity to vault not only\nMaybe Pashto you and get yourself in business you know the big twelve championship but now you're back on a national scale West Virginia continues to impress every week Randy I'm they've got Kansas this week the over under it said it's sixty one and a half West Virginia probably scores that themselves [laughter]\nI was just this week it and I'm On board with that and I thought Baylor um had their moments against Oklahoma despite losing sixty six thirty three they look pretty good in the first part of the third quarter I think they get by Kansas State today I don't know if they cover the five\nBut Kansas State I'm just not worth ... really sure where they ... they ever really really struggled yeah but they they give him credit because they didn't give up against Texas last week\nAnd in late they looked like they weren't going to make a game of it\nAnd what that was the Nineteen fourteen ballgame\nYeah like what Matt rule is doing out a way go but [noise]\nI don't know you never go against bill Snyder but uh I think that that might be actually the most eyebrow raising game that you have in the big twelve this week I liked the boats a lot I don't know what I'm going to go as you to cover the nine and a half and I've already said I like Texas and an upset this week ... straight up\nAll right well I like Oklahoma to be Texas I think ... gonna be way too much for the longhorns I also like Oklahoma State to beat Iowa State whether good to have some sort of an impact\n... boys run game and David Montgomery by the way the wind running back ... states still don't know if he's going to be able to play or not that would obviously impact the cycle owns I'll go with the cowboys there and by the way Texas Tech tease you not playing this weekend there is no night game tonight and the big well\nThe red writers on the horny toads will play each other on a Thursday alright that'll uh just about do it for us it should be a fun weekend a fun day of football do today Garrett\nOh absolutely and then we have a ... Miami, Florida state this weekend or so but we got out of there is some good stuff is a lot of really good games in college football this weekend so there's really no reason to leave the house\nAll right well see that's another edition of game day Saturday we over your team wins [noise]\n\nJane day Saturday has been brought you in part by the ... law for my bra by homeland grocery by banks central National Association and my love for commodities thanks for listening to enjoy the games today and be sure to join us next time for the women's game day Saturday\nUse radio one thousand Katie okay am an ex X Y FM Ninety six point one\nInching closer to the high court on hand ...

I'm loving I don't ever let me put it this way I don't ever think about how water now on there I think about it at all or hadn't thought about it until you brought it up this morning [laughter] anyway I guess I'm just saying I share I share your\nConcern and I've been through what you're going through tell me this uh you know your new home\nOr you know are you going to just have the regular old fashioned home inspection done or are you gonna use your resources and have some uh some industrial industry professionals come and look at stuff\nYou may disagree with me but I'm buying an actual it's actually pretty much a brand new it's it's\nI never will not disagree with on a wow a year old so so you you might have been really great and all kinds of ways\n[laughter] I didn't think I needed to do all that you may you may tell me oh\nNo no I mean uh honestly a brand new home I mean a lot of that stuff is going to still be under warranty or or home builders warranty so\nA lot of that stuff um\nYou know I don't think I don't think so I don't think he comes into play near as much as when you're moving into a home that you know maybe ten years old Fifteen Years old or older than you need to get stuff checked out\nI can guarantee you if I was moving into that was probably at least ten years old I Would have been having a sort of like cameras and and and doing some nontraditional things yes\nOh I bet I bet you would have said OK biggest concern I mean 'cause a lot of folks out there doing the same thing that you are I think you touched on the pulse of what's going on a [noise]\nAnd you know in America right now is a lot of folks are taking advantage of the interest rates and probably never be slow again a lot of people are upgrade moving maybe even downsizing in some cases are what are some of the other concerns that you run into that dinner fresh on your mind right now\n[noise] [noise] oh\nYou mean example what do you what are you looking for here\nYou know like when you're moving your moving into your new house or you thought of the hot water heater you're you're worried about that and you're even taken steps to offset that or is there anything else that you've thought about and looked at that you're thinking you know\nA one you know you want to check out or maybe you're concerned about the situation that had set up you know ah things that people usually don't think about till after they moved in like in ground power lines are above ground power lines\nUm all electric or the gas and electric or just things that are popping into my head\nActually I'll give you a situation where I took my father in law were to look at the house and it was concerned about the drainage and the way it's there's a retaining laws on both sides me uh-huh and\nHe was working on the dreams will not even the next day it starts raining really hearts he goes over and looks at it and sure enough right in the back patio and a flower beds of water is just standing so it's kind of have French drain sure\nSo obviously water run off and looking at how things especially in a new building I mean that's probably one of the things you have to worry about what new build is is hasn't been established you don't know what the water runoffs going to be like their\nExactly no it's a great point a and a lot of times especially in like you said a new builds no one's been around there long enough or to experience that the weather or in its full capacity and so they don't really know\nEffects are side effects they may be experiencing\nUm [noise] and a lot of times uh you\nKnow depending on which house was built first you may have a home that was there that had no ... storm drainage issues and then uh they build the house next door to it and it's raised and now all of a sudden it's displacing the water from its footprint or that is now causing a storm drains issue or on you\nA kind of like what you're saying with the retaining walls or it's probably displacing some water and it quite possibly displacing it onto your backyard\nRight or the other major thing that bothers me new bills situation is is you know [noise] things settling you know like I Need peers in three years sure you know things like ... like when they\nCome to these ... these new neighborhoods and they ... they got the dark I mean it takes a good I don't know what the timeline is ray maybe you can tell me but it takes awhile for that ... to settle down and compact\nYeah and a lot of times you know they'll take a steps to compact it um you know you see a lot of job sites where their wedding wedding it down and rolling it went down and rolling it in their ... soil can pressing it\nAh and then also I guess you know what type of a you know is disappearing beam home with ... or is this a slab home or maybe post tension slab a you've got a lot of different options there that also kinda offset or the potential of settling\nAnd so on where the boots are you know where you're plumbing Vince and everything come through the roof they had gotten up there in sealed around those thinking that that's what it was leaking but it was it was never those it was the vents\nAnd turn it may not have been venting right\nExactly or in and that's what happens I mean you know when we get off on the wrong track but and I don't mean to turn this into a rabbit hole but I I kinda just wanted to make the point that ah sometimes I give you a great example if you're buying a home and it's on the septic system aerobics system\nI Would have an industry professional come check it out\nI Would not settle for just a regular you know generic home inspection on something like that I Want I wouldn't want someone license or certified in that industry to come and look at it and make sure that it's that it's right\nBecause in a lot of instances on stuff like that it's just if you don't deal with them every day and you're not on the cutting edge of everything that's going on with them it's really I think it would be really tough to know if it's if it's right or not\nCan you think of any other examples James\n[noise] um\nI don't know if they are [laughter] I mean the roof is another one right I mean\nEverybody knows I think a lot of these guys and listen I Am not knocking on home inspectors just\nSo there were clear about that or I have a so much respect for those guys because honestly there's not a lot of human beings out there they could do what they do they have to know so much about every industry to be able to go into a home and basically inspect everything\nAnd their job is to protect you know the ... the homebuyer or to make sure that things are in working condition in at least up to code or and so their knowledge base has to be so broad\nOr that it's incredible I guess all I'm saying is that without being a ... a specific professional in a specific industry there are some things and it's just impossible to know I mean\nIt moves the the the technology and everything moves so quickly it's it's hard to to stay abreast of all the changes ended no completely\nThat you know yes this is this isn't good working condition it is is it should be\nOr no it's not as all um I guess all I'm saying\nAll right that's that's my whole directly inspectors they come out they don't really have enough time to go to your house\nYeah I mean they'll they'll ... they'll go through it but they they're looking for the blatant obvious fail safes right um you know a ... valve on a hot water heater that's not plump to the drain like it's supposed to be they're going to get that um they're gonna they actually catch stuff\nBut the ... yeah I think you're saying the same thing I Am it's the down deep stuff\nOr to be able to look at that uh aerobics system or that septic system taken apart a little bit\nMaybe spend thirty minutes open it up and take it apart and be able to tell if it's been maintained properly or not if it's functioning properly I don't know that without having an industry specialist on it I don't know that you'd be able to satisfactorily accomplish that\nAll right I rent a burned all our time James I'm Sorry\n[laughter] I'm long winded today which is kind of surprising I didn't know that\nI didn't I didn't realize I was going to be long winded but I guess I Am a I'm doing it now we're going to go into the break [laughter] when we come back I'm gonna let James have the whole segment we're just going to listen to James talk and talk\nOr let my son he said when he was talking and talking every day [noise] or miss those days I got to have them in central Oklahoma when they'll some outrage trumble mall forming the red river [noise] and you are listening to how to fly on without the [noise]\n\nWhole glow homeless pests illusions of

you know we were talking off the air uh during the break and I was saying how I'm enjoying this conversation and ah you\nKnow something struck me while you and our visit and James is that something else that I think would be really interesting to find out in and I guarantee almost nobody probably does this is to find out what work's been done to the house\nOr you know put forth a little effort to find out uh you know with your with your county or city or what what's been done to the house you know just to follow up ... you know with the septic in aerobics system or when those are installed or modified\nIt's all registered with the state um and so in that particular instance you would call the department of environmental quality and you would give them\nA you know your name your address and you can ask them for a copies of the final which is the drawing of the system tells you who installed it and all that you can also ask them for copies of any modifications\nSo if any repairs or changes have been done to it it should all be registered if it's not\nOr if they don't have a final then that tells you that the system was not installed legally ah so\nThat would kind of you know if you're buying a property that would red flag you immediately or that that waste that on site wastewater system was not permitted through the state and it's supposed to be\nA ... to me that would immediately draw attention to a problem a chicken with the city state or county a pin on what it is a of anything that's been done to the home\nOr because remodel projects and things of that nature you can also uh pull records on an address and find out you know what's been done\nA again a lot of times when you look at home or you can kinda tell when there's been an ad on done", "year": "2018",
