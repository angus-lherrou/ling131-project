{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "[noise] well this is a bit of an unusual situation for my ... to be in a Eric the cowboys are one and three in big twelve play last time they started a season or in big twelve games like this was the very first one\nI got to be was the head coach and uh the interesting thing also or the maybe the bad thing about that is there one in three playing what everybody thought would be the easy part of their schedule\nAnd uh things start to crank up a little bit as we move down the stretch with taxes coming up a which are probably will not be easy with long Lawrence playing a little bit better than they still have Baylor coming up by a um West Virginia team the trip down to Norman ... you and the trip to Fort Worth to play\nTCU and I know a lot of people are kind of at a loss as to why nothing no changes really are going to be made here during the off we\n... it might get he says that you don't have the players are players that can make the difference and they would already be on the field and then back set up by say well first of all I think he did a good job of protecting his players but when you back it up by saying that that ... and putting them in the right position to win then yes\nYou're taking the blame on yourself but that also means you you better be making changes as coaches to figure out how to get them in the right position to win what plays to call you need to be watching more film don't take the week off\nOther than to go recruit and figure out how to put this together because otherwise you can still make a bowl game this year but radio I'll go so far as to say that\nShe was gotten to the point now where anything less than nine wins it's going to be considered a last season and for oh you it's anything less than ten and this is just an unacceptable year for Oklahoma State and\nI almost feel like in a lot of ways that they just kind of packed it in for this year knowing that it's going to be very difficult to win two more games on the schedule just to get bowl eligible and get those extra three weeks to practice which is something that she was sorely needs\nYeah and that's a pretty much the way I look at it as well and it really makes you wonder uh you know a lot of their men are a lot of people talk about quarterback changes\nWe've seen some in the big twelve a couple of teams have gone to freshmen quarterbacks been very successful like as a freshman Spencer Sanders he was the Gatorade off into player of the year and in Texas high school football last season so you know that get as a lot of talent Mike has said\nFreshmen have a tendency to be hurt to get hurt and if you look back at least as far as old as you as concerned\nI think he's basing that are in some factor do you remember I don't want the quarterback or at at a ... a few years ago he was going to play his freshman year he got hurt Mason Rudolph also had a couple of uh injuries while he was playing in his freshman year with a foot\nOr ... or so there have been some guys who have been in that role at OSU that did get hurt\nAs freshmen so but right now you're I'm beginning to wonder if you don't need to find out what drew brown and Spencer Sanders have\nGoing into at least going into the next season because you know nobody's they've they've only practiced they've not play they don't want them to even played in the spring game [noise] so what what they bring is still a little bit of a mystery\n[noise] and you have enough you have enough games where they could still use the red shirt correct so but boy you add up games let them schedule you could still use the red shirt\nAnd they can't they can't play them in all of the games but you know you can buy you can play 'em in a in a couple of other they have four games where they could they could play and they have five games left on the schedule six if you get to a ball game\nI think the only reason might ... not doing that is because my ... he doesn't see any light at the end of the tunnel\nAnd if you have a situation where you know one or both of these guys get hurt and could possibly be sending out next year then you're really ... that's true and six and six eight and four and how much of a difference does that make in the bowl game that you're going to go\nTo our living room a big difference and it'll make a big difference I think in the feelings of where you are if you've finished eight and four and with a chance to be nine ... nine wins when you count the ball game six and six is that's not very good at all\nNo and I would imagine even if you're eight and four at the end of this year the Boone Pickens is going to be screaming and hollering and and and wanting something something to be done about the current state of OSU football and that's one of these things that I I always like to see how that drama plays out between boon in my gundy\n[noise] yeah we could have a little more of that as well you just never know I Will be back to talk about the abbreviated make twelve schedule and some other games of interest around the country when we come back on game day Saturday on the ...\nWhen bad things happen Richard

here at eleven o'clock and then the rock Shakur is out at the hub of the high plains in Lubbock to play Texas Tech this afternoon\nAnd that game so now we're talking about the only thing that makes that game interesting is the fact that jet Duffy could be playing quarterback for Texas Tech and the reason that's interesting is because his name's jet\nAnd if your name's jet you should starting quarterback regardless if every guard listen you're the best guy on the team your name bean jets\nThat that is worth at least fourteen point\nEspecially if you're a wide receiver unfortunately he's a quarterback and he didn't play particularly well even in the when the tech had a you know last Thursday down in Fort Worth\nSo avert your eyes avert your eyes away from Kansas Texas Tech today because there are some really tasty treats this afternoon in college football and at two thirty your thumb is going to get quite the workout with the remote\nAnd it all starts with Colorado at at Washington

honoring the memory of those guys are tonight\nAnd some other eleven o'clock games you've got all burning old miss which might turn out to be pretty entertaining Tulsa does play Arkansas it's one in

ah so tell me if you guys are either one got big plans are for for Halloween it is right around the man right around the corner Monday rise or woman\nOr man the a kitten yeah we always do me a bill in may we do with the ... the three kids man we uh and there's really a threat and we always looked a bit of trick or treating and okay and\nI didn't didn't you tell me like they ended up ...\nI I Do mayor so when we get back on ... a love to do it right\n... Maine where where is that ... time no man or I or my kids are going to go door to door oh yeah of course you know that that tradition but the or as they get older and you know I'm really looking forward to the ... or ... people are does pass okay under the your kids I mean that's a fact that oh well I mean\nThat's what we we took our kids all the time and now that they're old enough man ... I'm actually looking forward to the time\nI think it's fun to a man I I think it's uh I'm In this place now where my kids are older and so you know they're going to Halloween parties and they don't go trick or treating anymore and uh but I Do and I enjoy in and out the candy and a and water to the adults and ah\nYou know it's it's a good time I Love seeing all the kids and ah you know and now it takes me back I remember my guys being dressed up and it's you know it's big night for little kids that um\nBut yeah my boys you know there there's still dressing up and now they're going to all of these you know parties semi adult to Halloween parties and all this kind of stuff so contest yeah a little a little different little different demographic there so that's all good and I I'm just you know\nI get excited when holidays come around a because you know it's it's a lot of activity it's you know\nIt's a chance I don't know about you guys but for us we see we see family and the next three months this month November December ... we'll see family and spend more time with them and the next you know Seventy five eighty days and then we do the whole year mind are such\nGood everybody slows down or takes a little time out to say how you doing what you've been up to [laughter] that's what he's smart about Darryl ... a ... a\n... liquor stores busiest time and I was just wondering if because of all the family and in a while it's unfair and was curious I Know people man that the you know look for this time of year for that reason yeah you know families ... of my family\nYeah uh I think you know um well gosh I don't know I mean I'm sure the liquor stores do get busy I'm One of the uh I think I think there was a lot of recreational a drinking probably associate it but\nBut then you know I think I think you know if if I were to put a challenge out to everybody I Would say you know\nTry to try to spread some chair with a total stranger a lake that's I think that'd be a good goal there everybody just just a total\nTotal stranger a and you know Brighton Brighton their day you never know you never know what kind of day or or what's going on in their world so it'd be a good holiday thing rile up salute a you know what we do a which just\nMe I'm not saying this any bragging doses type way but I'm just saying that we are in our side of the family do Thanksgiving early\nOr and I jumped on now jumped ahead into November but\nUh we do it early so all the family can come and it doesn't conflict because everybody everybody's married and so each household you go into you're dealing with two more branches of family everybody's trying to spend time together and celebrate the holiday all the same time so my wife came up this ingenious idea to\nDo it about a week or so early and then it's amazing it works great and so we have our Thanksgiving early like that\nAnd then actually on Thanksgiving Day a little tradition we've kind of started that's just sort of worked out is there was a restaurant in Broken Arrow that gives out free Thanksgiving meals yeah and a lot of folks show up for that and most of 'em or\nYou know might be in a position where they really need that that free meal and\nThey need volunteers servers and so messy and on the boys we we go on Thanksgiving Day and that's where we're at we're at that restaurant serving these people and it's awesome and it's been a ... and ...\nIt's been amazing to watch the impact on my boys they're ah I really think it's it's made an impression on them and to see how hard they get in there and work and how\nTo see them extending the kindness to these strangers in this restaurant doing you know serving them and and realizing that you know a week ago they had this huge meal\nUh with thirty or forty people in family and surrounded by all this you know all these wonderful blessings and to see these families coming in and you can tell right away that some of these families this might be the only kind word they're getting ... ah for the months or maybe for the year and so\nI think it's neat it's a good thing so anyway a healthy challenge to put out there that have ... plus a stranger or so we have a lot to cover today right guys when do you guys said that you want to talk about senator ...\nToday a which is it is what it sounds like they're wanting to talk about you know clean and your place\nAre and how important it is right yeah and\nThey're all my life that you really just have a a about the only way you could put\nIt on and and if I can I'm going to try to take these guys the route of talking about bedbugs a little bit because of very good friend of mine is actually going through a bedbug experience so this is this ... this is the closest to home that this incidents ever hit for me\nUh it's always been this thing that we all talk about\nBut I've never experienced it are known anyone that as experienced it but I literally have a great friend\nGoing through it right now so I wanted to share a little bit about what that's been like from from his side and from my side just watching it play out crazy or as a thank goodness we did call mother nature's and they're coming in to save the
