he's been able they're throwing in running um he's\nGot some pretty good ones but he ranks right up there with any of them\nAnd if you're wondering why Tyler Murray likes better is a baseball or is it football and he's already got four million to play baseball here's what he had to say on the damn Patrick Joe\nI Love both a closer look though it's just you know there are two different games that can really explain it you know less uh [noise]\nSo let's just play both to this level really really do do a ... put it it's just er just football you get the rush of running out so honest does equal ... maybe maybe five thousand people watch\nIt and if I'm a ... if I ... that I I tell them to go play baseball even if you have an opportunity to be drafted first in the NFL and make more guaranteed money right now\nIt's just the toll that football the NFL football takes on your body and you're going to have a longer career in baseball even if you only make AAA even if you only make AAA you at least are probably going to live past the age of\nFifty file and ... and if you're going to be a good player and you know he was a first round draft pick if you're going to be a good player you're going to have a much longer career and baseball you're going to make much more money you're a risk of injury is going to be much less\nI you know and you're not most generally got to be playing in front of five thousand people I mean even not it is not even in Oakland for crying out loud it's not going to be a hundred dollars obviously but you know a lot of those games are played before you know thirty forty fifty thousand fans and it's obviously it's different than football but\nI'd be by was is that I'd be going notes on your baseball's where you're going this\nIs not even to this is not even a choice for me there there is there is no choice you go and you play baseball you finish up this year with college football you do what you can for OU and speaking of oh you in and play offs

college football today sands one really good game the world's largest outdoor cocktail party and that would be Georgia versus Florida which for you that's when you want to pay attention to because one of those teams gets eliminated here's why you root for Alabama today\nYou want Alabama to go undefeated and eliminate LSU next week at a wad of Alabama you'll end up being if you're oh you you want Alabama to go undefeated eliminate LSU next week if LSU wins\nGoes undefeated when's the SEC we've already seen that movie of Alabama just has one law\nAt two SEC teams that\nI don't want to assume that Notre Dame is going to feed it but they've got a very weak schedule and what do you use gonna have to worry about is when the resume start getting compared to Ohio State to Michigan to Notre Dame of those teams have won loss\nThere's a very good chance that all three of those teams will have a signature when that Oklahoma may not Oklahoma's best when Randy might be against a Texas team who

and they're lucky that some teams play head to head and take care of each other but\nStill it's still an uphill climb and they're still going to need some help\nAll right let's take a look around the big twelve to day coming up a little bit later on this morning Texas Tech and I was state or the red rate is up and it's a it's not really been set in the world on fire these last couple of games I

I I don't mind the ... the cool weather I kinda like it not cold emphasis on that I I like it cool me too uh but uh\nYou know it just never seems last we always get just a little taste of perfect weather and then it goes to the bottom ... yeah or stream cold\nYeah you know most of the time I guess uh I I like to say if you had the day's uh we probably have about three months but what about Ninety Days ...\nPerfect weather in Oklahoma yeah okay a little like by going to have to buy into that sure there is of it's either hot or cold so I got a question for you then this is has nothing to do with your profession okay but what are your thoughts do you think that we're going to have a hard winter\nYou think we're in line for one cause you know the last two or three been really soft so it's been a while since we've had a hard winter I think we're due for one from what I understand the farmers' almanac says it's going to be a rough winter oh really you know and you know it's interesting the farmers' almanac is usually usually pretty spot on\nThey're calling for another one what was it like six seven years ago where we have a lot of cold and a lot of snow really\nI didn't know that that's what they're you know I have a lot of respect for the farmers' almanac but I never look at it\nAnd that that's just sort of a I guess a conundrum in itself I don't know why but uh I Do know that a lot of people rely on it um and it's usually pretty dang accurate history really does repeat itself well\nI Hope it's wrong because I don't know I I like the cold weather I like having a day or two is no to stay home and chill out with the family right but when it starts hindering work into two down for several days you know but it is what it is winter we need all the weather that we can get it goes to the whole works for some good\nI Can't believe this because you and our friends but I think we're at odds on this because uh you know the harsh cold in the snow has the opposite effect on me you know it makes me busy\nThat's true so I don't I Know I Know it's not good for you know and I respect the yeah I mean you know well I guess if it's just me down for a few days I'll just say men raise doing really good you know that I Am out there getting frost bit and I'm killing it ah you know I'm Out there burning the candle at both ends\nWell and it doesn't it doesn't really shut us down you know there's still a lot of work though surely asleep it slows things down quite a bit\nI was wondering you know because we talk we talk a lot about the fact that it Saturday an impact on the insect populations ... and you even seen a surge of insects that you don't normally\nSee you because the winters have been so mild that things that normally wouldn't have survived are carried over they are yeah uh and so they're not getting diminished like\nThey normally would right oh yeah yeah and you know depending on the temperatures were you know the last few winters I mean\nWe do with a lot of problems throughout the winter still that typically are more spring insects gas out there you know uh I think we talked about that this year I remember like in February put in our yard roots back on our trucks yeah\nAnd using them in power treating lawns and we'll start up till about ... getting into April so yeah and that's how the last couple of winters have been and are kind of hope this winter's are saying but you know for years so\nYeah ... you've heard me say I mean my one of my sons he says that we're moving towards the tropical climate so uh now whether you know he's not a meteorologist or anything so I guess what he's Nineteen so take that for hours but then I heard what are they\nHear something about that are really you can't I Can't believe everything you read on Facebook but I was reading an article about this area turning into more tropical it mhm [noise]\nBut it's tight and it goes out and even if it goes to septic system aerobics system or a municipal sewer\nThere's not supposed to be any any way for wildlife outside of the system to get in it so the fact that it's in their tells you that the system's open to to nature now a couple of ways that can happen\n[noise] uh one is a really simple when\nYou are your kids or maybe the service technician was out doing some work but somebody removed the lid from what we call to clean out which is like a three or four inch pipes dubbed up out in the ground\nThat comes off of your main sewer and what that for has access to offer the line to run a drain snake ... uh\nPeople are notorious for taking that laid off and forgetting to put it on a ... yeah ... yes I feel as long as it turns out to shake it and play with it for my personal favorite you know somebody hit it with them over a cause it's stuck at CIA [laughter] I catch the blades\nAre and so that's the simple way so first thing you want to check and see if you're clean outs out there with no\nNow if you see the clean out in it\nHas the lid or you you say I don't have a clean 'em well now now we got a different scenario going on because more than likely what's happened is\nThe pipe has either it's either very old and it's become dilapidated where it's deteriorated and it's not there anymore or has parts of itself missing\nOr it's become separated or by the shifting of the ground in the movement of the pipe which has created an opening in the line somehow ... uh which these things all happened\nA and by that happening you got your mold cricket a snake or a frog in its borrowing through\nIt's also attracted to the moisture which you're putting in the soil by running water down this sewer line coming from your home which is now leaking out of the whole that's in the line so this attract season ... is\nA pass and then they get in that line and then after that it's like it and it's like pulling out of congested neighborhood on the highway okay uh and now it's fifty fifty chance they ended up in your house or they ended up in the abyss\nYou know it's like if they go right they ended up in municipal sewer if they go left they come up into the network that's under your home so a lot of things have to happen and then they've got to navigate just write to find the one line that leads up to your toilet or your best to\nSo there's a good chance that you may end up with insects or pass in there and you never even seen them so there's a lot more snakes and frogs in our lives and what we know possibly I Would say it's possible though but I don't know how to truly don't live in the sewer and then come no more no way to live in this or\nAre you know and eventually met the methane gas or you know is going to kill anything breathing\nA so just killed it for a no that's all right that it was also fun until it was an alligator movie could delegate or movies more than likely yeah I'm not going to the sewer thing the methane gas is is poisonous it's a slow it's a slow silent killer or and so\nEventually anything that breathes oxygen is gonna you know get succumb by that methane gas but if it navigate the maze just right\nWhich is why doesn't happen all the time but it does have a ... there are those occurrences if it navigates just right and it gets through there quick enough it may and can find its way up in your toilet now I was going to throw something actually let me check my time here where we that has I'm just rambling\nA hang it because I haven't quite as ... as the okay I'm going into the break I'm going to throw this at you you can answer it coming back off the break or uh you said the or the insects and the pass\nIn our lives more than we know and I said yes and I started to say it's a lot like I read somewhere that people on average swallow seven spiders a year but don't answer that I Would hope it's true and a lot of people right now are feeling really creepy doubt they probably also want to know\nIs it true it's October the month of Halloween what a great
