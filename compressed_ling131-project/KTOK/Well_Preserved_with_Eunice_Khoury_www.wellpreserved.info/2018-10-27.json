L. A. Y. A. Y. yeah uh-huh and uh so did you go to some fancy design school\nOh well no I did not that would have been really fun um but I actually went to college on basketball scholarship um which nobody can see me right now but I'm five two so that's surprising to most people I was gonna say\nI Would have thought more Jim nasty right yeah\nThat would have been great you know I loved basketball and so I went to the University of Tulsa\nAnd um I spent four years there about halfway through that I have this like I think I Want to be an interior designer well tears at the smallest division on college there is and they don't have the program for interior designers so I was like well I'm here to play basketball\nI'm going to finish this out I'll go ahead and get a degree\nAnd but then after that I'll figure out how to make that happen how to become an interior designer and so my husband and I bought a house after college in our whole intention is that we're going to let this house but that was way back when all the flipping shows are like the only thing\nThat you could find on TV so I'm sure like we are not the only people who are thinking this is a great idea\n[laughter] you know we're really could've used ... because of the house we bought was a mess we thought this is going to be great at looks terrible right now and we're going to make it look awesome which we did but it was a long process [laughter] and then I Wish\nThat people that did that would just come and talk to me first because [noise] the first thing is you have to buy it in the right neighborhood right yeah you can put the same amount of\nMoney you can buy a house let's just say you buy a house for eighty thousand dollars and you put forty thousand dollars into it sure well in one neighborhood you got a hundred twenty in both houses right right\nWell in one neighborhood you might be able to sell it for one forty in another neighborhood you might be able to sell it for two hundred\nRight yes that's that is key that's like the first step right\nAnd your profit is made on the purchase not on the sale mhm even slippers your profits made on the purchase\nSure well and I mean we were babies you know coming right out of college not knowing anything about you know what to look for ... you know we didn't know anything so having a professional like you to say let's look at\nThe foundation what kind of electric does it have how's the plumbing doing because we moved in and two weeks later the whole line backed death and that was awful so um yeah we could have totally use do you uh [laughter]\nBut it does fight all of that terrible stuff we ended up you know\nAnd this was like my hands on design school so I wasn't able to go to college for it but we're like okay we're buying the house and we're going to start doing my husband got um\nA job as a construction worker he that he was a biochemistry major is a national merit scholar and he went to work for a construction company so he could learn how to read your house\nAnd so as that was like a wonderful sacrifice for him to make that he learned everything and I would stay at home and literally read that every room in that house like five times just so I could like\nGet the process down figure out what I like what I liked what my style lies and literally we were like we're going to flip this but then we're got into it and we're like we don't really like doing cookie cutter stuff we like doing like\nInteresting custom work and so that's when I realized like flipping\nIs not for me but doing meaningful design is and and so it was just a great experience we learned everything like we learned electrically learned plumbing learned drywall which is all like good knowledge to have\nAnd when I'm working with customers and they're like well what's it going to take to do you know bring down this wall and\nI can tell them because I've actually done it and they've actually done it with my own hands I don't want to do that anymore I'm going to hire people to do that right [laughter] well and\nYou know I've learned that people that are good designers are kind of a natural at it right you have an eye for it to a and you have a passion for it hard to learn that in school\nRight and it I mean I'm sure school has all sorts of benefits that for me having that hands on training and just kind of feeling it all out like yeah you're right it's very it's a natural thing but of course we all have natural abilities that we can work on to make them better\nWell and spatial design mhm I have to when we built our new house and uh\nWe had this one piece of custom furniture that we had actually bought at a garage sale but it's exactly fit this room okay and it it felt very good to us it was a section all very small scale because we're not real big people simply not real tall yeah but we could fit\nFifteen kids on that or you can stretch out and lie on it it was a great piece furniture and so we decided that\nWe built this room to fit this piece of furniture and then we moved it in\nAnd it looked like a Barbie furniture in there because in the U.S [laughter] and where it had come from was a converted patio room that had was seven feet four inches tall oh okay what looked like it was missing its legs or something or yeah and it just wasn't\nPreparation and light housekeeping called comfort keepers\nAt four O.
