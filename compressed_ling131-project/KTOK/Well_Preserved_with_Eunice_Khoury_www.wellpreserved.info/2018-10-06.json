did you get that started\nGetting more than in unison thank you for having us here today\nTrinity was started in two thousand seven by a group of Christian attorneys who like you said had a vision and it's a ministry that is based on two guiding principles\nMost importantly that God cares about justice and the poor we know that God cares about justice to the poor there are more than two thousand scriptures in the Bible about justice in about love\nHe commands us to see justice to love mercy until ... with him as we seek those\nAnd the other important principle is that God's Gift us he gives us at some are called to be teachers summer called the preachers and yes even summer cultivate lawyers and he he calls us then and requires us to use those gifts to bless others and so trinity was started in two thousand seven\nTo partner with other organizations in the city to provide legal services to people who are in poverty and who otherwise would have no access to justice for no other reason but for their poverty\nOkay and when you talk about poverty or give me an idea of what kind of income you're talking about for a single person or maybe a family with three or four you know in
