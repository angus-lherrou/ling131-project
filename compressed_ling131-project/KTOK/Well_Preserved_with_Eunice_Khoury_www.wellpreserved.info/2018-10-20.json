Mexican grill\nAnd Ron we kinda left ... a couple of things done didn't we we did it again okay well let's see let's see if we can round up and up finish apart we started\nWell I don't know if a goldfish what we started but we're going to get a little further down the road how's that okay we had the question about the authority to remove into soap property and I'm assuming this is when a person has passed away or you have to be very careful about that\nBecause you have to see what is the authority to take the property if the individual for example has a ... spouse and everything's enjoy tennis with water survivorship then yeah sure you know the surviving spouse\nHas the property has ownership of the property ... personal belongings that what is the owner well usually those were within a joint tendency situation arise survivorship situation of it's held\nA separate property which some people do some people have you know an edge in a prenuptial agreement where they have their own separate property then then that's a no at that particular point a but if it is you'll jointly old property the majority owner you know would would have that\nBut let's say let's let's ... spouse you have a single individual or they pass away\nA ... you cannot just remove the property from the state and then sell it without authority you have to see first off his there will and then get the court to determine if that's the valid last we went to estimate we called up probing which means to prove\nIf there's no will then you have to file for administration of the state\nEither way the court has to okay or authorize\nThe inventory removal and sell the property if you have a trust and the properties in the trust we did talk about that a little bit then the trustee then takes over\nAnd would have the authority to take possession of the property inventory the property and do with the property in accordance with the trust agreement which could be to sell it\nThey liquidated or maybe they have to hold and distribute it depends upon what the trust of human says but in mentor is is critical\nThe personal representative which is the executive order minister later in the state or the trustee should take control of the property and manage the property that is their duty that as their responsibility\nAnd they can be held liable personally if they don't follow that responsibility if someone else whoops in and takes the property they could be liable to the state or to the trust for that property that was taken\nWow so there's a great responsibility\nThere is and you just don't go in and say well dad died and you know there's his guns and there's this stuff I'm going to go take no just doesn't work that way you have to look and see what dad had in terms of an estate plan if any and well and that ah\nEven with a will whoever's in charge the personal representative or administrator at the state they have to make an inventory of the state right\nThat's correct the ... the will is a proved robot did accepted by the court is this is the last will and testament you know it's probably done then the personal resented the executive the wheel or if there is no will the administrator is required by law\nTo get together to marshal the assets gather the assets inland tore them\nThen to look and find out if there aren't any creditors and that's where we get noticed your creditors have to go out if you know I think you know who creditor might be you have to put them on notice\nJoe Smith passed away do you have a claim against the state they have a specific time period and make a claim and then and how that's handled but the idea is for the court to oversee it an appoint someone\nTo actually do the legwork to get the assets together\nCollect whatever debts and claims there are than the court makes the decision as to how the assets go these if he's the debts and then on the court makes the decision as to how it's distributed usually the quarter look at the wheel and say that's the distribution will follow not always there are times where it doesn't work that way I'm going to ask\nYou a question that I'm going to invite you back\nTo answer because we're just about out of time but what happens if someone dies and they've got a stack of ... like credit card debt or does all that data come out of their state\nIt is there isn't theirs alone\nThen that is within the state that if it's in and you have to notify those creditors that there's a lot of individuals passed away or that there's an estate you want to set up a probe aid to give them the opportunity to file claims sometimes creditors don't file claims\nTo four two fifty three hundred for home care in Oklahoma City Edmond\nShake heated and Tulsa\nMaxine is well
