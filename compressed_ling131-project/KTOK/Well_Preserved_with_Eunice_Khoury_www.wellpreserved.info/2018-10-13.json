Mexican grill Beverly good morning\nAnd thank you for calling in and do what's your question\n[noise] yeah um we just had a couple of questions about the um cross race issues um\nOne is that musty smell that often happens we do open our hats and the spring and closed them when it gets cold um is there anything else we can do or anything special that we are overlooking um that might could help with that\nIs it in the basement or musty crawl space ... okay well have you have you been in\nThe ... the crawl space you know crawl spaces or by nature dampen than than dark is rising under that could that could be causing the smell or is it like that all the time or just absurd that\nIt's pretty much like that ... most of the time I haven't been under there I kind of draw the line going under cross\n[laughter] good for you [laughter]\nThat's a smart woman we're dealing with here you Beverley from Norman is a smart woman okay [laughter] um\nBut um yeah I mean I've had people work on the house and they've been under there and now they haven't mentioned anything but you know that's another question I guess it's\n... to maybe come out and look at it and check to see if there's structural issues or if there's something else that can be done about that the ... or\n... well I certainly I can check from for structural issues I certainly wouldn't guarantee that I could pinpoint what the cause of the of the most of the issues are Beverly that's sometimes those are really tough deals was just at the bottom of [noise]\nAnd the messiness is typically caused by moisture though so you know maybe a\nYeah it seems to me that vapor barrier might protect your house but it also might try water unwritten that might start distinct do because it could if you have a yes so you might look for that ... the cheapest way to have someone checking under your half colored termite guy they'll do it in her might inspection for a homeowner typically for free\nOkay and they might find termites so I mean but if you've got um got termites you want them you want to treat for them and the moisture by the way that is a threat to a home from a termites standpoint too\nBecause it if you have standing water dilutes ... the term I chemicals barrier that's put in the ground to prevent that are much from getting into your house or\nIt dilutes the chemical and it just destroys the barrier so and it kind of attractive termites them more sure does they have they have to have more so that's you definitely need to get checked out and if your term I I can tell you\nHaving crawled under their boy you need to call Dave to look at their house\nBecause you got some issues so huh ah\nI'd start with termite [noise] okay and uh just say I just want to be sure it spells mostly under there won't be sure I don't have termites but a reputable termite person uh to me I avoid the big names\nUh and if you would like to have the name of a couple of good reputable termite guys a call my office seven to two thirty to thirty two\nOkay my experience with the big name the big names has not been good in my profession uh-huh ah sometimes people treat and don't have to treat right ah do you need a really honest guy that knows what they're doing spin around a little while ha ha ha\nAnd then as far as the structure goes um we had\nA we renovated about ten years ago an added on and there's a a a backdoor that um you know you kind of had to lift up a little bit to lock\nAnd I didn't know that was I Know that the house is quote unquote settle at times and so I didn't know that was okay or that's something that's like how much is is too much is\nEnough to to be worried about as far as the settling goes\nWhat I Do with doors as I go ahead you we just got less\nThan a minute ... you know I I carry a ... a two foot leveled the really and I put that on the head of doors\nAnd this of the bubble was inside the ...\nYou're fine or if you're noticing constant change with your door that you keep having to adjust that that means the movement is active and you probably\nNeed to be addressed addressing it but if it's not bad and it seems to be stabilized than I Would just to adjust the door
