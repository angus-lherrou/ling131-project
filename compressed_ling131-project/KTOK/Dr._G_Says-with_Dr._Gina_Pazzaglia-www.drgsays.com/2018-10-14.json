three three [noise]\nSee [noise]\nSee [noise]\nMoney [noise]\n[noise]\nNow back to more save money radio with your host their coats and\nWelcome back I'm Derek ... your host of safe money radio I'm a save money retirement specialist working with science right here and the Oklahoma City area\nSo here's a question I'd like to ask you how much of your money is currently in the market and all of it fifty percent eighty percent did you make a conscious decision to have that\nParticular percentage exposed market risk or did it did it just sort of a happen\nWhy am I asking well as I've said before the markets go up and as we all know they come back down how much of your life savings that is exposed to market risk is a very important consideration and that's why I strongly encourage everyone to think of their money in terms of red money and green money\nThose terms might sound funny but but I think they'll help but help us understand a very important concept so let me explain red money is money that we're willing to expose to market risk in hopes of a higher return\nWe accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater gains red money has exposed the upside and downside market risk with green money were not willing to accept the risk of loss\nSo we're willing to accept a lower return and exchange green money does not have downside market risk\nSo Fred money's exposed upside an downside market risk and green money has only upside market potential which one is better well uh-huh that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad at it all depends [noise]\nThey're very important question we should ask ourselves or these what percentage of my money should be in red money and what percentage of my money should be an agreement [noise]\nIf you're at or near retirement you should ask yourself if any of your money should be in red money I mean can you afford to lose any of your retirement funds\nWould

their side and can afford to lose money in hopes that don't make it back in the future they're rich can afford to lose at least some of their money and still live comfortably\nBut if you're at or near retirement you should definitely be in the grain which is money that cannot be lost due to market declines many people believe that all retirement money should be green money personally um I think that makes a lot of sense\nDepending of course on on your situation but many people I work with regardless of age what a hundred percent green money because they know they can have upside market

person making the decision think about that the worry the stress goes away just think if you have read many losses and get upset probably the money should not have been in red money\n[noise] so this makes it easy to decide you ask yourself this question if I were to lose some most or all of the money in this account would I be upset\nIf the answer is yes then your money should be in a green money
