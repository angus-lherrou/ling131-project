retirement with less stress and more comfort than you ever thought possible there are actually two purposes for money only to know more and no is the first purpose is life and the second purpose his death\nI bet you've never heard that before I'm sure everyone you've listened to or taken advice from has always tried to tell you about growing your money but it was never told you about the purpose of money so what does that mean a purpose for life or for that\nWhen I say that one purpose for money\nIs life I mean that you are going to use the money while you are alive in our business we call that income duck right with income no matter how you look at it if you spend the money while you're alive\nYou're taking income from that money for the purpose of life\nWhen I say that another purpose for money is that that means that you are going to use the money once you are dead or you're not actually going to use it but we call that legacy in other words you aren't going to pass the money on to your heirs\nAfter you're gone now it's critical your financial planner understands the importance of creating strategies for both the purpose of life and death\nSome strategies work better for income and others worked better for legacy but the ideal strategy allows you to maximize your income while protecting your legacy just in case you don't live as long as you hope to that is\nWhy you

purposes for money spending the money while you are alive or leaving the money to those left behind\nBy far the most significant purpose of money is into it is one thing to not leave your beneficiaries any money when you were gone\nBut it is a disaster if you outlive your money\nIn fact studies show that outliving retirement income is feared more than that or public speaking not the purpose of your money is income\nThere are only two plans for that purpose one is called a plan for death\nAnd the other a plan for life and if you have a broker or financial planner that isn't an expert and plans for life\nI'm certain you were on a plan for that what is a plan for death when it comes to retirement go well here it is you save up your money and invest it and something to provide a hypothetical non guaranteed rate of return or a short term guaranteed ready to return in other words\nYou have no guaranteed for long term growth you might hope\nFor seven percent compound a growth but after fees and market crashes and rate aspirations and so forth you have no idea what kind of return you're going to get in fact\nYou don't know if you're going to get any return because the next two thousand eight might be right around the corner you save up your money hoping it grows\nAnd then at the point you decided to retire you start drawing income from your house how much do you draw for present three percent five percent or do you just drop out them out you need and hope for the best the problem with this plan is that your hypothetical growth\nIs combined with an arbitrary spend down of your retirement accounts you have no idea if the plan is going to work\nBecause you don't know how long you're going to live\nIf you die sooner than you thought you spent too little\nAnd if you live longer than you thought you will probably run out of money before you die in order for this plan to have any chance of success you need to plan on dying by by a certain age that's why we call it a plan for death do you want to plan on dying by certain age\nDo you want to plan on dying or plan on living in a second I'm going to tell you about applying for life\nAnd if you want to find out

proceedings now that case involves an illegal immigrant where they prior criminal record\nUm probably because of antibiotics or something I had a good information and I've been doing everything under the sun by ... robotics my digestive enzymes to do in a high levels of good fats and all that and all that help but I still felt bloated and also not realize this morning let's blow that list information\nSomething's going on there and you have a receptor sites for serotonin throughout your gut\nAnd I believe CBD ah\nOil or the different ... with in that interact with serotonin and uh so what does your research showing you [noise]\nUm yeah so definitely your body when when you have CBD and it goes and attaches to your um ... receptors\nOr it's going to attach in there and then it's going to help your body regulate itself and go back to homeostasis so levels of serotonin and melatonin that are produced naturally in your brain that while you're getting better sleep is because the melatonin in in your sleep cycles are being regulated because your body chemistry is finally back to normal\nSo that's the best thing about it is that it's it's it doesn't get you high yesterday you said it put a smile on your face and you speak from your experience with it a high that you're feeling or know that\nIt was just in um how would I explain maybe a slight bliss but it was just like hey I feel really good yeah when I exercise and exercise hard\nA afterwards I have a ... for you from the exercise same thing when I meditate\nThat's why I told you on another show that it could be called meditation in a bottle yesterday because it gets to the brain a lot of the same benefits you get from meditation and people that do meditate by the way do live longer why is able to stress stress is killing you folks that release of cortisol out of your adrenalin glad eats a muscle puts on fat\nOr fix your heart causes plaque buildup causes depression or can bring on dementia and maybe even old timers repress your immune system the opposite of that allow somebody to go back to normal\nRight and so that's the one of the great things about CBD products in in our product specifically are Colorado chairs brand\nIs that it doesn't get you high it doesn't make you feel loopy the I mean you could you you drove home I mean you could you know we had we had no doubt about it and you just took our strongest product and so um you don't have to worry about getting high you just get back to normal things you\nHad a guy told me today has eleven year old dog it reminded up ... ... it reminded him of the dog whenever the dog was three years old it's it's you're you're getting back to those juvenile years where you can think and you can act and you can play and [laughter] and go back to normal how ... the way you want to be it increases your quality of life\nYeah laughing about that 'cause I was a lot of trouble with a high tech things ... and stuff yesterday ongoing got I got to find me an eight year old and when I look back on it when I was young the level of concentration I could do then\nAs I've gotten older 'cause I wouldn't get quality sleep\nWhen I Would focus on something I Would just fall asleep instead of being able to meditate for two hours and hold that consciousness and focus on what I wanted I\nCouldn't do that like I could a young it I'm sure my IQ tests wouldn't look like it did when I was in college uh this is ... ... and the young brain but this helps bring it back to a young brain ... at a young buddy 'cause we talk a lot about the brain and the facts and the brain does affect the whole body\nAh but you also have receptor sites throughout the body for Canada that correct\nYeah absolutely yep CB one and CB two receptors so CBD will go in attached to those receptors in certain ways and then the other can have annoyed that are found in in the hint plant\n'em they'll go in attached to a different receptors in different ways and see they both help your body at the same time they're not mutually exclusive and so it there's something about having those molecules altogether um some people call it the entourage effect when you have those altogether than it creates more benefit and amplifies the effects\nWell speaking of that some companies split into the different products where some kind of a dolls are better for peripheral pain or there was a the body but not necessarily go across the brain barrier and others focus on the brain but years does both than it could lose full spectrum\nMhm yeah we've got islip products that are just CBD by itself which does cross the blood brain barrier\nUm and we have topical is that they get all the way down and go through your skin and instill cross the blood brain barrier and then we have full spectrum products that I'm can open up your receptors and you can have more benefit from those um those can avenue it's because you have the benefit of its\nMolecular friends over there the the CBGB's the CD in you know the other molecules into that can get in there and help and each one of those can attach to different receptors site and and help say your your gut for instance or your brain or your heart's something like that\nWell a before we go to break here I Want to mention some of you may be dealing with addiction cigarettes um uh some of that may be drugs some of them you're or someone you know may have a ... opioid problem\nThis can be really helpful and helping them I'm not going to say it's a cure for that though in like a light too but there's research being done right now maybe we will be able to say it uh in the near future that a is a cure\nBut let's not step away from the cure statement and just say what a wonderful adjunct it is to any kind of treatment our program you're doing to help you overcome that urge to whether it's a smoke chain tobacco or whether it's a alcohol or drugs you you may not natives who brings feel like it should\nRight I've had many people tell me that you know ... they had been going home and drink in a a a glass or two glasses then it became a bottle of wine every night and when they started taking CBD your CBD feed that need 'em that you're that you're addicted to feeling before\nAnd it can fill those enzymes in your liver and your cravings can go away so whether it's nicotine or any other kind of chemical substance alcohol anything else like that it can get into your bloodstream and help curb those cravings help you it could help you quit smoking quit drinking things like that\nThat's really important because um [noise] I Know firsthand I'm such a child the I'd try to help raise from age ... ah for to to induce thirties\nUm marijuana then what it leads to from there and there is a connection folks it makes it much easier when you're wanting to stay high and escape from reality may it may be that it didn't cause it\nBut uh when you're trying but what makes you want to use it to escape from your anxiety is
