Stanley\nBrothers Stanley Brothers right okay\nAnd and now we're now we're I'm using a jak stuff and ah we've had you know Jay ... elaborate on that ... that ... they bend\nA given Grace Anne and I'm Dr Getty can't believe the test result she's like this is\nOff and this is better than the stuff that we've been having her\nTell tell them what price you're paying a from the other company\nWe show was shipping and everything we were paying around three hundred and eighty four hundred and twenty dollars just to watch yeah and yeah\nIn the retail price on on the exact product that I gave him was only one forty nine to its doctors' opinion that it's it's it's a better more concentrated has more molecules in it and it's it's less than half the price\nYou know every Tuesday there's a group of medical professionals some and then the truth of the world so I'm actually a one is uh works in emergency rooms as a doctor and different once we get together for about five hours and we're studying all the latest information\nAnd I get on the talk a little bit about the CBD or because they were looking at another one that costs three hundred and Ninety nine and I said the one I ah like\nBeing a CBD plus usa\nIs about three times higher and the CBD it has all the different CBD a spot in the spectrum that you want in there and the other one apparently they're using the seat that starts out with the agency and they have to clean it out and they destroy a lot of the other uh important Canada dolls\nAnd I said they're a CBD usa works out to be about six cents per milligram where this other one\nAnd that they were looking at was twenty six cents I said next Tuesday I'll bring you the different aspects of the lab this so you can see how some of these compare\nIt 'cause I said some of them you in the ... the doctor that was heading the programs that some of these you usually don't do anything for him and he was saying because they don't have enough and bigger three but it's also because some of them are not that effective and yet everyone in the world has jumped into the uh the arena of the CBD who you have to get\nReally good quality especially when you're dealing with something like your child here I can say you want the best and to be able to get the best at a much less uh less prize because you probably are used in fairly heavy dose aren't you\nA yeah we give her a like to point seven and ... every morning and evening so it it it goes pretty quick so you know it's been great being able to have a TV CBD plus you say um you know help us out and\nGive us or their oil and it's just been great for her and the other thing too is um you know Jay we were ah Jake got to meet Grayson and she was\nComplaining about her back that day and he gave her some cream that they have and we put that cream on her back in at night when she gets out of the shower the bat and you know she doesn't sleep a lot but we've noticed you know the night to you know the cream on her back she sleeps all night\nIn um is it so restless and um you know that something to that I Would definitely suggest for people to definitely try that cream for sure\nYeah I ... the story that you told me the day after I gave you that cream was that she had never slip past five or six o'clock in the morning um and then you put the cream on her back in the next day she slipped to what seven or eight oh wow like\nSeven thirty yeah\nThat's fantastic now the cream itself understand it would not only helped the muscles relax but we'll go all the way into the blood so you're getting some of the sex of the CBD just by using the ...\nYeah ... ... the formulation that we're using a lotion is designed to open up pours and it's designed to help your your ... your skin Oregon um absorbed as much of the active molecule as we possibly can so it is ... goes all the way and helps um actually get into your bloodstream\nYeah that's what I notice I use on the back of my neck or or if I have a particular shore area and I just had Jake bring me some along with some more folks spectrum CBD I'd run out then I had some others around the house but I can tell he is and stuff I before I met Jake I had another one that supplied me and I do\nThis I Need this Jake ... now we're just about out of time here but John I really appreciate you sharing this with me\nAnd uh sharing with the audience for some people out there may have grandkids they may know someone with some of the problem was maybe not as severe\nBut to know that there is something after they can try now out or have Jake give you my phone number because there's something else that a top of this that I use both that may help her even more so on sleep the sex the gab a part of the brain and stuff\nAnd that may be a very helpful so if they get\nOn them yeah Jay a CBD plus USA's awesome they've been great to us and um I just wish you\nKnow everyone can see gray she ... she was two years two to three years ago to what she is now
