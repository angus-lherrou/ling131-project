{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "Because people know and I am bullet proof I get the same advice we don't change as the wind changes now we change strategist we change allocations but we don't change the strategy of this is what we know works cash gotta\nHave it ... guarantee a principal got to have it and when I say clients and prospective clients get that second look people\nGet a second look because Damon does an analysis for you it's short simple sweet one page and if he shows you where you have a big hole and your portfolio\nWherever it is you better pay attention to it because you have to have that now now\nPeople that didn't have let's say protection the only changes we actually made in some clients were this one client always comes to mind because it was a million dollar little change\nAnd he said to me I you know even when you were talking about that I'm guaranteed principal thing you keep bringing it up and I keep going nah that's just let it roll everything's good I Love these you know Eighteen twenty five percent retired\nTo revisit that I'll never forget those words out of his mouth can we revisit that and I said yes we sure can\nAfter the crisis ... not in the midst of the storm but as soon as this is over and the dust settles now we'll reevaluate but he was working he owned a company he had no business or any thoughts of retiring he loved his business so\nIt was not on his radar and it's not his nature he was a huge gambler I mean literally a huge\nGambler goes to Vegas he loves crafts he loves poker he loves to gamble that's why I was so successful in this business up too because he was willing to take these huge gamble that eventually ... huge\nFor him well as you like to say education is expensive ... you're the ... and the Android or showing what did you believe or you know the financial crisis was a pretty expensive lesson\nThe expensive lesson was the ones for people that weren't diversified enough or you know they were little diversified but not the layer diversification\nSo let's say that ah you know there's somebody right now I'm who went to the crisis\nAnd they were in their forties and so they didn't necessarily like it but they also got plenty of time well now they're in their fifties maybe their mood for these and retirement is within the ten year window\nWhere you know we've had a great run for the last ... years what would you say to someone right now who maybe didn't go through the heart of a financial crisis in that retirement window but now they're they're\nWhat would you say to them to kind of prepare for the next big ...\nOkay I've got some great advice because the next big one is coming and there's going to be a big adjustment so not a question of it or when exactly and what we know is coming so\nDo what we do get prepared for the storm so you survive everything you know the thing and I'm probably most proud about besides of course my partners in the business because without you all I could not grow the business the way I Am\nBut our clients them being so smart in listening in preparing and doing the right things\nYou know I'm most proud that we didn't lose one client in the financial crisis that's just unheard of when they took me to New York and people were grilling me about how did you do that that's impossible especially J. P. Morgan because in the depression they brought in J. P. Morgan I mean he was brought before Congress and then it was like okay we grilled and now\nShe can you help us out here and he did he helped out in the depression\nJamie diamond did the same thing with the financial crisis they call you know he was like the head of this ring of private bankers\nBut you know not losing a client was critical but I ... and going back and reminding clients how proud they should be of themselves because I just helped him through it makes their decision\nAnd I said right or wrong if you say go to cash with the stroke of a pin we can do that in our office with the stroke of a pin\nSo you know people knowing that that is something that they can do they have confidence in that we have had the best partners\nThe partners we have like one of them in particular they have Ninety eight percent retention rate ... that's just unheard of in our industry so when we get a client though and we agreed to be partners with them because we look at it for life\nBut nobody can change my opinion and if people don't fit our model and don't get it that's perfectly okay with me because I can sleep well at night I don't have to worry about you're doing something stupid [laughter] you know I don't want we we just don't have clients like that in in our in our family\nSo I Would tell people to make sure yet that second opinion do to be sure that you don't have a hole in your portfolio because the storm is coming yeah\nYou need to get the flashlights you need to get the water you need to have a safe place to go you need a plan especially getting close to retirement because we saw so many people that\nCouldn't retire none of our clients everybody went on vacation nobody had to take money out of their accounts nobody because we had plenty of cash so you didn't have to take money out of your investments when they were going in the tank right until they recovered\nOur clients we did everything we could with Congress to be sure that our MDs were frozen that didn't work until February but they finally figured it out yeah\n[noise] well you know we have seen on ... in the intervening ten years since the financial crisis or you know there's always a dangerous good when we see that kind of gross but people started your greedy again I Know where they go they go Gordon Gekko greed is good or you know in your opinion\nAnd the ten years since the financial crisis how we learn from our past mistakes no more not\nNo for White House so well because what happens is is that people forget just like the old booms every ... the real estate been people forget and you got to remember now we've got a whole new generation that didn't suffer them so they don't\nLiterally or their parents or other people talk about\nJust like the depression but you know our clients have and and I love the fact that like we had people come in last week and said our kids are going to have their house paid off and you know Fifteen Years and\nInstead of thirty are longer so these these that generation the parents that have really taught their kids that really got hurt and they teach their kids\nEarly that you know listen what grandma's it safer rainy day because the rain has got a gun we need the umbrella we need the glasses and if we need the rank up we need to be prepared so if you take he did that and don't just think it's like a wonderful that you can turn it on and\nIt's just going to run forever no because when it shuts off just like Jim was financial when it shut off they they acted like the world is coming to an end because of their mortgage company will they oh they're hiring firing four hundred people\nBecause there's nobody getting what they did in so twenty seven thousand people\nLost jobs twenty seven million people losing jobs\nSo the bottom line is um don't don't get greedy you know you you\n... bed ... that's\nExactly right you need to have a plan and it doesn't have to be you don't it's not a plan that is you know pay by the pound\nIt doesn't it it'll be five hundred page plan\nIt can be as simple as one page of the shows your goal buckets ruin my cash this year my guaranteed protected money is here my investments are here and that's what we do here ... because what we know that the reason you listen to the show and probably other financial shows is that you know retiring well as an easy\nAnd you're not quite sure exactly where to turn to what to do\nAnd when we get it sometimes you think alters advice just sounds the same well there's a reason for that we all have the same stock market you can go talk to fifty different advisers and you may hear the same types of things maybe some things are different\nWe know what you're really looking for being trustworthy giving you advice on your investments and Social Security taxes that's just the price of admission that's what we do All right\nThe other stuff that you're looking for those someone told her hand say look\nThere is a path forward and we hope to restore order to your life and hope you have that piece in your life so if that's what you're looking for\nThe American advertising federation presents at week DC\nAn annual conference for area
