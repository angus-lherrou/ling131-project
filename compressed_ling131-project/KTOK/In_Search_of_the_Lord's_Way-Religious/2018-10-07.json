forty and about five seconds tell where your money is coming from and while you're paying a lot on taxes I guarantee your CPA can do the same thing if you're not getting that and certainly we can we can help in that regard and help steer you in the right direction [noise]\nOne of the other dark sides uh that that we deal with and we see this a lot and unfortunately this is one that uh if you live long enough you're probably going to be with this one\nAnd we're talking about diminished mental capacity raiders fear among retirees is running out of money Okay Number one but on probably right underneath that is the fear of diminished mental capacity being aware that your mind\nOr the mind of a loved one is slipping is a really terrifying thing okay when you know and you're mentally aware enough and you can tell the little by little parts of you are being chipped away at that's terrifying and it's sad\nIt's terrifying for the loved one it's terrifying for the spouse if terrorists just terrifying and you don't want to accept it there I mean I\nThink about um a client that called me one night and she was telling me that her husband\nWas using different words weren't an object like an apple and he'd say ... can you hear me one of those I was bringing when those apples\nAnd she says a capital he's never eaten apple and he meant the on the counter was about ... orange and and she's like\nShe thought it was weird and then the next week something else happened in the ... it just kept getting worse and what they found out was finally they took advantage of having examined and he had a golf ball sized tumor on his brain\nAnd it was pressure the pressure was making him you know not be able to to pick a word that he knew that he would call something different I mean it was terrifying to him and it was terrifying to her\nBecause you know to the the ability to spank him to walk and do all these things you know we understand getting injured but when something just begins to happen to your brain and you don't feel it ... your brain as as the Oregon on your body has no pain receptors your brain itself feels no pain you don't feel yourself happening this these things happening but\nYou see the results and um this is one of the ... one of the areas that um it can it can affect you personally but you can also see when you have diminished mental capacity other people are out there ready to take advantage of that\nAnd you've got to be aware of these red flags I'm sure you had a situation like this um with one of our clients men Katie\nI'm Katie has been a client of yours for a long time I know and she was pretty successful your psychology is okay very uses her brain all the time in her work but we started noticing a few little things here and they're they're just seemed odd and out of place\nAnd it continued for ... days were much better someday are much worse and we all noticed it and we show Julie would\nNotice that when she would talk with her or you know we're ... times the\nYou know when someone comes in and says this is not Katie and that means is is not the case that we've now we we all know what that means in our office and and you'll feel the same way with a loved one ... you're the one that knows them best so when you feel that that it's like this they're not all there there there are a prime suspect right now for\nThat for people to take advantage of and we hear horror stories all the\n... yeah and that's why you know\nYou've got to be aware of these red flags when you took an additional step because sometimes it's very difficult to talk to the person whose mind might be slipping and as it turns out\nShe had been diagnosed with early onset dementia that's what we admit that's what we all of them we found out but sometimes it's very difficult to mention that or talk about it to the person so you took ... of looping in one of her family member\nYes and and I did that and you know we hold the confidentiality of clients you know to the way to the extreme however when this happens you've got to be able to to be able to have a family member that you can talk to\nThe person also needs the power of attorney and so you should have those documents and we had those documents and said you know had cars are out of state and said you know have you in the conversation is simple like have you taught your lightly and Oh yes and so and so and I said well she was really concerned that you\nUm hadn't told her that you were going to Hawaii\nAnd taking the family and he said\nNo it Korea blah\nBlah blah associate just led into because of the conversation I Know both families it was easy for me to say we don't want to give her a call 'cause she air feelings for a little heart and she's a little confused about\nThat and he said\nOkay and so then he calls her and then we can all now have a conversation right because we've ... alerted him because again they're out of state we're talking to her more than he is right now he's got two little kids in his life yeah he's got a successful business ... you know this is what happens\nSomebody though it's got to stay alert someone and whether it's ... if you have the power attorney that's that's one way to do it as well\nYeah well and also having my power of attorney can protect your loved one or you and if someone you've identified someone else later on in life and you should do this was a part of your state plan\nThat will handle your financial in medical decisions in the event that you are incapacitated physically or mentally has someone doesn't just come in or that you don't on the phone shine or you know give someone information or sign away on a document and you don't know what you're doing\nAnd I can tell you they they said that the uh the biggest thing in this this came in are the continuing education ladies it's us it is women we are more\nTrustworthy we just believe it when somebody tells us something and women are being scammed especially there's an age bracket of late seventies mid eighties were\nThose are the ladies that are getting scanned the most and if you have a loved one in that age I think about it if they get scammed and let's just say they take all the money out of their house you can't get it back where are those where's your loved one going to go yeah they're going to come live with you\nSo we do as families as we are getting older it used to be taboo to talk about many issues and I'll still not my family my mother she's at that age and she is still a taboo they can't move past the fact that it's a taboo subject and it's really not so we talked about it over the years with mom that you know we just want to make sure she is taking care of\nAnd not taking advantage of so if somebody does approach her\nJust call someone\nGet they get a family member to get a second opinion because they'll they'll stop a scam in a heartbeat her story on that two daughters getting involved with their mom sons getting involved in finding out that yes it was a scam\nAnd unfortunately it happens to women more often than men because women live longer so you have a higher likelihood ladies of these things happen to you just for simple fact of living living will now\nAnd they think because your spouse has gone you had more money if you're a senior citizen you're female you're tired\nThere are periods who look at the obituaries [laughter] they are good people who have who are in grieving who are you know dealing with situations so and you're listening right now because you know retiring well as an easy but you're
