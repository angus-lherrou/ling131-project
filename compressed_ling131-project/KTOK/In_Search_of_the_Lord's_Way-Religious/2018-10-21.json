like to know all the insides secrets that Damon his stocked out yeah CSPAN stock this for us\nThe reason I bring this up ladies and gentlemen as because today we're talking about your your your likelihood of being financially successful and here's something that I think is because you know Victoria part of the reason I looked at this because you told me this is this is one of your goals not a dream a goal okay\nThat's the thing about your the power of thought you know I tell the story all the time in my classes that I teach\nYour ability to think and how you think will dictate your success and the story I use is is every day you drive down the road and you see this gigantic house and it's your dream house it's everything you've ever wanted\nAnd one day you drive by and you see that the houses for sale and run a little flyer that they have a front it says a price tag of five million dollars now what kind of person are you are you the kind of person that thinks oh I could\nNever afford that or do you think what do I have to do to afford that there's ... ... that's the key right there yeah\nAnd so you know you're thinking to yourself what am I going to do to get the American express black or not and oh God I can never get that you know if you see that then there's a pretty good chance it's never going to happen but if you make it even a one person reality in your mind\nThere's a better chance you're going to work toward that and that's a big part of being financially successful now is just imagining the all these things are possible\nAnd the thing is is that you talked about earlier is writing down their skills and and getting your financial house in order so first you've got to get your financial house in or\nNothing is ever going to happen unless you get your financial house in order then you've got to take the the God given talent said she had been given and you've got to figure out okay how am I going to make this reality well I can tell you how it's every single day you\nDo something towards that go it's just like when I get up I say every day Tuesday exist in one is how am I going to or what I can I Do today at to help us\nGrow our business and that means how many more people can we help then the second thing is is I had a personal goal is the second thing is and what can I Do today or who can I talk to the day to help Kevin ... became governor and I have done that\nSince probably I added the Kevin stat since March and and look what's happened ... you know he beat out nine candidates he I mean he's doing it so\nIt's you but you got to say it you got to write it down and then again I tell people you have to share it but what it is done it's helped us reach our goals because I wear his finger on one\nSecond multitasking\nBecause it's helped people have a conversation to try and very interested in why\nThat you think this is so important for Oklahoma against all these ... wonderful people that we had had to step up to the plate to test our of our state and but it's open up conversations and re engaged\nRelationships that I had you know I've been working my nose has been to the grindstone I haven't been out and about as much as I Would like to be or should be probably\nSo you do have to write them down and you must make it a priority but you've got to start your day off with that much for every single every single day or the year is going to be over just like that 'cause we all know how quickly it happened you know it's Christmas okay we just celebrated New Year's eve and it's now Christmas\nLawyers the crazy thing uh Thanksgiving is about a month\nAway he didn't want to remind you know ... well I didn't need to but I just want to make one up through automated hyperventilating I notice or a little bit and\nLook we know that you're listening right now because you are a goal oriented person or you would listen to you wouldn't be listening to the show and you probably wouldn't be listening to the station which I have to be honest people listen to the station and shows like ... smart people who aren't goal oriented and you want a lot out of life but you also know that you can do it alone\nAnd or maybe you had been doing it alone you haven't been getting results that you want\nTo say oh you've done a really good job and now you just want to go be retired and you want to have a partner that's going to help make sure that she had that piece of mining confidence and trust that it's all going to happen that way you want it to\nAnd just just like our ... he said this week look I'm a smart person I I could probably do this but I have no desire to I Want someone who's going to hold my hand and I just want peace I Want to save harbor that I can come to you guys are going to help\nAnd I just want peace in my life so I can go do what I really enjoy that is right and that's what we do that's that's that's the whole purpose why we exist\nAnd as I say all the time that it is it's all about you know waking up every day knowing that we had the privilege of making a positive financial difference in people's lives I mean who wouldn't want that\nWhat I Do so if you are looking for that as well give us a call if you have at least five hundred thousand dollar save for retirement that number is four or five three for eight zero nine zero nine we will sit down with you and uh and just about sixty minutes\nWe can help you figure out what she wants to go that's right and um you know what you'll get your financial advisor in order you'll have\nSomeone holding your hand through it all and those written down it's right on that you're going to have it all\nHave everything which one that's right until next week it's been a great show thank you for me and her diamond my

that charge from President Trump who says Democrats are openly inviting illegal immigrants to violate our borders this as a caravan of about two thousand migrants crosses into Mexico from Guatemala\nThe fact that the good news here is that in bringing it back Trump largely brought back what we had before there was a bit more central planning to it and that's unfortunate there's lots of things like certain cars if they're going to be made and sold in North America tear free they have to have\nA certain amount of labor costs at least sixteen dollars per hour the inputs in the car have to add a percentage of I think Seventy five percent be made\nIn North America that's unfortunate that the Republican Party has historically been one about free markets and freedom for producers to do is they wished without\nA mentally and there's a little bit of central planning and the new NAFTA but largely at the same as the one before and investors broadly\nLike that so let's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of course of her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact it has so just very briefly what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have on our economy and how does that try to manage it\nWell I'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed and I wrote a book about it called who needs the fed I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exist as a lender of last resort to solvent banks but it can't really do that you know solve the bank would ever go to the fed for a loan it'd be it'd mission of bankruptcy\nThe fat also regulates banks but it can't really do that very effectively as two thousand eight reminds us and then\nOf course it aims to set the overnight rate which banks lend to one another button interest rates of price like any other you don't need the fed for that and so I think the feds impact is vastly over and people say well you know they're going to reduce interest rates and that's going to ease up credit\nThat's the equivalent of married to a place you sane in New York how apartment rents are too high I'm going to reduce how much landlords couldn't charge for apartments all he would do is just cause scarcity and the same way of markets actually responded the fed the fed to the best cause scarcity by trying to artificially\nLower rates below what they would normally hitting the marketplace so my point is is is we in the real economy we largely act as though the fed doesn't exist that that sort of an ... that sort of an outlier position\nBut I Believe it will be increasingly common place in the coming years\nThe fed has been on a rate increase I won't say binge because they've been doing it in smaller increments this past week it did seem to skin or the markets a little bit will the fed raising the the rates will that caused the economy to cool off or given your previous comment cereal really don't think it's going to have much impact in the long run\nYou know I don't think it will have much of an impact it all let's remember the fed kept rates low at about Syria or the rate at at aim's set for years and years for basically two thousand nine until what about twenty Fifteen or twenty sixteen\nThere is no major economic boom during that time the fed can change reality when when we're when we go to the market to borrow money we're borrowing access to real resources to trucks tractors computers desks chairs most of all human labor effect can expand the amount of that available it can't make\nA these resources cheap and so I think the answer is is to always remind ourselves with the fed is just another entity try and influence things not very well\nWe have been talking with John Tammy who is the director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks John tell us a bit about freedomworks also working folks go on the Web to get more information from you\nFreedomworks is a wonderful organization based in Washington DC that makes the essential point that Washington is not going to change in less politicians realize that they're the voters are
