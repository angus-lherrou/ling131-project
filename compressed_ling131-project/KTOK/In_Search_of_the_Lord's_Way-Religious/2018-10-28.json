{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "Come into our office and as we sat down and and discussed with them the aspects of their financial plan their income plan\nOne of the aspects that we talked the most about was how much income do you think you're really going to need\nAnd and lowest felt like they needed for more than what Greg felt like so you know they need to come to an agreement there but what the story and I discussed was look you've never been in retirement before so you're thinking you're probably thinking you need for more than what you really need sometimes people underestimate\nIn their case they were kind of overestimating\nAnd we said look before you start taking distributions you've got enough cash to live for a year taking here\nTake a year to try to figure out what your budget is going to be take it for a test drive\nAnd you should really do this at least two years before you retire determine how much you think you're going to need to live on a retirement and then practice living on that amount for about six months if you can't\nWell then you know you need more so either lower your spending or maybe plan on a part time job but take it for a test drive try to live on that amount of money\nFor six months and if it's more than you need well maybe that's a good problem to have\nThat means you can put more money into the plan let it grow and you don't need as much to live on particularly if you have a paid off mortgage mortgage is usually most people's biggest expense and retirement age still have one well now you've got you pay off the house you can inject that money back into the budget probably put it towards healthcare\nNumber two you need to adjust your spending plan after you take your test drive with your budget be brutally honest about what is in need and what is not\nMaybe you don't really watch enough cable TV to justify that bill it didn't take me to retirement to figure that out that's why cut the cord we don't have cable\nWe have Internet three cable provider but we don't have cable t._v. anymore because I have three hundred channels and I watch maybe ten of them don't need all that\nSo now we have streaming services like Hulu and Netflix and slang and Amazon Prime and whereas I was spending two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars a month for television that I wasn't watching now spending about ... the major savings\nJust by cutting that and you know what I don't find that I really miss anything I mean I've replaced basically Ninety eight percent of the television that I watched if you'd like a little bit of a inside and tips on how I did that and what it's like and the different services that are available I'm having to sit down and talk with you I envy king\nOf finance but I'm also the king of cutting the court and if you worked for one of the cable companies out there I'm very sorry I don't mean to offend you but my job is to protect my clients' money and so that's what we're going to do on the show and part of that is saving money when you don't have to spend it\nNumber three you want to check your emergency fund and your medical coverage you need to consider having Eighteen to twenty four months of cash\nIn the bank to cover non discretionary items also get estimates on Medicare premiums\nYour supplemental policies you long term care policies and then add those to the test budget to see okay well you know between Medicare premiums and supplemental policies and long term care policies all these things I mean you know we're looking at eight hundred dollars a month whatever that might be maybe more you know let's call it\nFifteen hundred dollars a month I don't know what it's going to be but added that to the budget to see if you can do it and you can't well then you know that it might be some gas may need to plan for that number four\nMaybe there should be number one but you didn't make sure that your spouse was on board retirements a team sport doesn't happen in a vacuum if you live alone okay that's different but if you're married\nAnd there's more than one person in this retirement game you need to make sure they're on board we will often ask\nSpouses when we visit with them if they're ready to retire one will emphatically\nSay yes and we have to say that's great but I was asking your your wife or your husband [laughter] and they're looking at is shaking their head and you know\nA lot of times guys it's it's your wives they want you to be happy they love you and they want you to retire they just don't want you to spend every waking moment with them at the house because you know when you when we get older as guys we we tend to annoy our wives\nI Know that what happened with my wife she would make me do something she she would make kick me out of the house\nSomehow but [noise] you know that's a that's one of the things you have to think about is your spouse on board with your retirement communication is key and finally number five you need to be sure that you're going to enjoy retirement retirement is not\nA a ...\nAnd obligation it is not a requirement it's something you should do because you want to do it\nWe don't know too many retired people who just want to sit inside all day to watch TV very few people just want to travel all the time so when you're retired you need to make sure well before retirement that you haven't gotten your retirement\nHours and days and months and weeks years filled with activities how are you going to replace those activities in your work life you have power you had status and prestige you went to meetings you knew people you've chaired thing now you don't have any more what are you going to do just sit and watch TV all day you just going to travel all the time\nMaybe for the first year maybe you'll do that and your sleep in and you'll think wow this is great and then after that time you're like okay so what do I do with the next\nThe nine years of my retirement you're going to have a plan for what you're going to do you need to be sure that you have a variety of activities and goals for retirement whether that's volunteerism maybe you're going to start a business you're going to mentor you know you're going to help your church\nI don't know pick something\nYou may find that retirement the idea of retirement is really just not for you Victoria says all the time on not ever going to retire I'll go do things that I Want to do but I'm not ever going to retire because she knows and I know and we've seen it over and over some times\nEarly retirement before you're really ready can lead to an early death because your spirit lax motivation and your spirit\nOkay your spirit your energy that's what drives you that's what gets you up every morning you gotta have something to look forward to so make sure that you're really ready to enjoy retirement and that you're not just doing it just because everybody else is doing it\nRetire when you're ready or not because some date on the calendar so and we know that you're listening right now because you know the retiring well isn't easy\nBut you're not quite sure where to turn to what to do I'll be honest with you getting help with Social Security income planning managing your investments looking at taxes your state plan long term care\nWe do all those things and guess what a thousand other financial advisors in town do those things to they should that's what they do okay you don't go to your doctor necessarily because they're really good at being a doctor\nThere are a thousand other doctors who are good at being a doctor to why do you choose that doctor because of their personality maybe or because of great service whatever it might be for us\nWhy our clients choose us above others is not because of all the the knowledge we have\nIt's because of what they're not getting someone who's going to hold their hand and help them restore order so their lives because retirement disrupt the natural order of your life you've never done it before so you need someone who has walked that walk with other people lots of other people\nAnd restore order to your life
