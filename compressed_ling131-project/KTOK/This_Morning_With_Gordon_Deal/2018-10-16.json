by it could give an example\nI think the clearest example of that as you look at the Affordable CARE Act you know high profile Republican tide turkey on it for a pack and remember famously Ted Cruz shut down the government over Obamacare when he first got the defendant you know he was running rallies outside the capital and he was really use any sort of outside\nPressure force on Republicans in

Republicans and you've heard of that are working outside or because he's been in politics are more than a decade in and out of the house I'm under him but he's he's running this kind of campaign against you know the average met again politics as usual against the way things are usually done in Washington\nAnd so he he's kind of trying to go on to this sort\nOf anti establishment anti politics

recently the rise of online retail sites like Amazon and others so now watch here's Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man Jordan what's ahead\nWell it's going to be a big downer for the holiday season uh they're going to be liquidated the stores are probably at least a hundred and fifty stores and then all the merchandise who's going to get dumped on the market right in the middle of

market share it's been around for a hundred and twenty five years I mean they had a real run out of pick the stock for example is a hundred and twenty dollars a share in two thousand seven down to panic is now yeah so it was one of the great American companies or just to keep up with a ...\nWhat what could have saved them stay say I don't know what's starting in the eighties maybe there were probably some critical decisions that were Mr maybe nineties\nI'm certainly going online much more aggressively a kick out the stores are keeping up with the latest fashions are competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores\nBut it was it's a huge company that I have a lot of employees of the high cost space it would've been hard for them to survive with is very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what's the thing about fears too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now that they sort of live in fear\nI think so I'm In the stores have not been a popular anyway so they don't occur but a a debit card you know\nThose places will be we developed\nA maybe for the stores maybe for other purposes I mean those gems in restaurants all kinds of things that come under these places [noise] um so or even Amazon Amazon starting to open stores though so that's purpose will be the space will be repurposed but it's got to be a big drag on a lot of malls I'm currently have\nA total of about eight hundred and twenty stores Sears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon\nThey're in chapter eleven reorganization but if they don't do well enough to the Saudis is probably liquidate the mall for about eight hundred and twenty large stores\nThat will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com he's known as the America's money he answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing how about the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well they're doing in a very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in and they know who you are you just take things off the shelf they walk out but I Know exactly whether this is no cashiers whatsoever so\nAnd they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it is an irony but they're doing is much more strategic way with much more limited inventory in select vocation fears just got too big and had too much of a jury of too many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\nYeah I mean the products are good and and yes I think you're going to say when credible low prices\nFor appliances electronics and clothes and all things with the IRS offers yes I think people will go up there and clean the place out with them which is a tech sales away from other traditional retailers will probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices\nFrom Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation of love affair stores\nWill we still know the Sears brand than a year five years and no\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example anywhere fears about that for four hundred million dollars um they've got some but most of the brands have been sober for I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear over the next\nJordan Jordan

emergency shelter and supplies to residents displaced\nWe're joined now live by Gail McGovern president and CEO of the American Red Cross guilt six days after explain what your folks are dealing with their\nWell first of all Gordon thanks so much for having me on this show and a half to say our hearts go out to people that were impacted by hurricane Michael it's really quite extraordinary storm and uh it's very difficult on the ground\nUm homes are gone schools there on business or on a power is still coming back um that a lot of people are without\nUm communication towers came down there still debris and some of the road so it's a challenging environment and we're doing what ever we possibly can\nTo help people out um we have about Thirteen hundred volunteers in the affected area and they're twenty three shelters that are open with about Fifteen hundred people living in them\nUm there were ten thousand people AT T coil but we also have um\nAt Seventy five emergency response vehicles and they're driving around the affected area and giving people a hot meal than um water and lots of hug and so far we've already served about a hundred twenty five thousand meals and snack so\nIt's a big operation um are volunteers here amazing I never\nUh never get used to have generous they are I just see can made me\nAny feel for how long they'll be there at this point\nWell we cannot leave until the last person in a shelter is played poker\nAnd of course we had um a number of people that are employees and volunteers that live in the impacted area because we're in about three thousand counties across the country\nSo um they never leave they they don't pack up and go home because they are home and um yeah we we just stay until people find a place you go we still have about ... people in shelters in the Carolinas from Hurricane Florence\n... is that right yeah yeah\nMan so you know this is a difficult period I I think generally speaking like stories now start not to get told right the media begins to pull away from affected areas as they start to focus on other breaking news uh does this become more difficult for the volunteers\n[noise] well um it becomes more difficult really for everyone um because\nUh you know we need health and we always need volunteers um you know those those um [noise] Thirteen hundred volunteers that I talked about they work two or three weeks ship for\nUm twelve hours a day seven days a week so they go home we have to refreshed unlike new volunteers so it can it it does become a bit discouraging when people think they've been forgotten not only the ears but people impacted\nAnd of course everything the American Red Cross does\nIs because the generosity the American public\nWhether they're giving us financial gifts to wear\nA donating their time to volunteer and I'm sadly Gordon um we had a a cancel a lot of blood drive between Hurricane Florence and hurricane Michael because a lot of them were scheduled in those areas\nAnd um we were looking at a bit of a blood shortage right now so we're also encouraging people to donate blood if they're willing to get the gift of life\n... speaking this morning with Gail McGovern president and CEO of the American Red Cross what's the what's the greatest need it\nThis one is it the blood is it the more volunteers money\nAnd yet yet and yet\nYou know what we're really focusing on is providing food shelter water um we're helping people figure out how to navigate period that some people", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Oklahoma
