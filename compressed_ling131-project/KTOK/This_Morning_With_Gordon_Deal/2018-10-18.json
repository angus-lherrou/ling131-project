been a top issue in federal races this year as Republicans and Democrats fight over repealing or replacing Obamacare what the real action this election might come at the state level here to explain his marine grumpy Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nWhere there are two issues and us direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care isn't some ballot initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah maybe there's some of the states that did not go along with the Affordable care act's expansion of Medicaid and its time um because because the governors in the state legislature there haven't done it\nBut as you're trying to to do it themselves they are and they're saying that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expand Medicaid the people the way of Obamacare intended\nTo do these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it\n[noise] well there's a there's some some pushback from officials in some other states\nAnd one of the interesting things that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative includes a way to pay for the state's share of expansion of federal government pays for most of the costs of the state does have some portion of the cars in Maine which was the first state to do this to ... to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe government has refused to go along in part because the funding issue in Utah now they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock\nBy including a finding initiative along with their ... their ballot initiative\nTrial so how similar or the initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in ... Idaho Nebraska in Utah\nThat ... the main tribes has the same is that the Affordable CARE Act allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people to earn enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um this is an issue one week and it's still um ... and as an issue in state that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly rural hospitals and other medical medical providers in the states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know across the country one argument for why that is happening by mail initiative is there any they're conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public official Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe Affordable CARE Act but if their voters say we want this then there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen ... Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece in total myth germs healthcare is the key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend we're state legislatures are addressing this\nIt potentially to their Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican who has worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a form with health care reporters that he thinks if these\nInitiatives these ballot initiatives in these states passed that it it could have started trend for the rest of the states that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the other thing that's going on\nIs some states that haven't expanded Medicaid conservative states have been asking Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that\nAdvocates for the Affordable CARE Act don't like such as ah imposing work requirements and that's another issue that to play some states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're seeing after example in um Kentucky okay\nYeah you've written to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors raises a good habit\nIn fact on this right that's a little bit of a it's not quite at an immediate impact that the ... the governor's aren't the only ones in their states that have to say in it in the state legislatures are due to come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\n[noise] boy what was that due to a lot like tying it to I guess the the federal government money would there be a guarantee that there would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written but one of the argument that uh a pound of expanding Medicaid I'm One of the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee you can't guarantee that they had that funding will be there forever\nOn Saturday in their argument is that it it's getting ended on his head

when hurricane Michael roared ashore on the Florida Panhandle last week it reserved much of its fury ... bay county were Mexico beach is located\nThe city of about twelve hundred people is unrecognizable now because of the destruction locals are assessing damage in considering the options for rebuilding homes and businesses what they don't want\nHigh rises and the spring break party atmosphere of places like Panama City beach Wall Street journal reporter John camp paid a visit John what'd you witness\nIt was down in Mexico Beach Florida which was pretty much ground zero for hurricane Michael and that hurricane the shore or we can go as well\nFor Keynes ever to hit the U.S and the kind of our the storm was packing or you could really see the results back at Mexico beach um it's almost hard to imagine what it once was\nIf you've never seen that before the storm because it's just wreckage everywhere um there's really no building that wasn't affected in some way\nAnd plenty of buildings that were just completely destroyed there are a you know small cottages houses that were just wiped clean and there's nothing left but a slab and maybe the tile floor and then the rest of the house is just the pieces all over the place\nBoy I think you said in your story too is the older homes right ones that are decades old fifty years plus maybe that took the the worst of the beating\nThat's what the locals were telling us is that you know the study had a bunch of smaller cottages\nThat were quite lovely but we're older and probably created a little more modern codes and they did not handle the weather well and um\nYou know it was it was a ... we're talking about a storm that came to show a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds and also a devastating search a water pushed in quite far down the combination of water and when and bring these houses was just too much\nWhat were some folks saying that they are determined to rebuild or some saying I Can't take this anymore I'm going inland where this is not as much of a threat what are you hearing\nWell first of all um there's a few people there\nBecause the uh um it's it's really fun in habitable right now there's no electricity there's power lines strict over the place for water doesn't work there aren't really sure whether the basic services back then there are security check points the wedding people in that have very limited so don't go well\nCertainly there are some people in town a bit allowed in to go to their homes and businesses and what I heard from them as they really do want her to be very eager to talk about what Mexico beach was like one of the storm hit\nAnd the fact that they are really really interested in getting it back to that that what they describe is really a kind of small town feel um you know quite quite a place that um you know through a zoning tried to keep away the high rises successfully kept away high rises\nAnd we really didn't have the kind of a spring break beach party atmosphere that you know some other cities and towns are down shore and they're very eager to try and reclaim that Ken\nSpeaking with Wall Street journal reporter John camp [noise] he's written a piece titled after hurricane Michael residents determined to rebuild shattered city he paid a visit to Mexico beach which took the brunt of hurricane Michael that came ashore on October ten anybody saying boldly I guess that it's not worth rebuilding a small town like this\nI did not hear that from the local ... ah we spoke with a former I'm Sheila administrator and you know he did he do adventure but hum as he said oh the macro level that makes sense\nUm but when you get down to the community level it's a very hard to say let's just abandon a place because it's destroyed and just\nYou know I think time will tell in terms of what it will take to actually get this place up and running in the utilities were stored showing that you can actually make the place where we will go a long way okay and you know\nIt was bad was it was there are people there right now\nIn terms of first responders and government officials are you know picking up debris starting to clean up individuals are they're carrying things out of harm's will do that so that they're trying but they want to salvage by the arm load people put the stuff into trash to me that\nThe cleanup workers under way it's just going to take a really long time\nAnd get the sense that any a large developers are circling like vultures making this would be the time to build that high rise that Mexico beach has tried to avoid because they can create a building that can stand a hundred and Seventy five mile an hour winds for example\nThat's a great question and I don't know if any developers are actually circling yet I suspect it would be hard for them to make it through the security checkpoint\nAt this point I think John's Wall Street journal reporter John camp paid a visit to Mexico beach

study by bank great dot com the top reason Americans are cutting back each month is there need to save more money but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride chief financial analyst that bank re read what are some findings\nAbout two thirds of Americans are limiting their spending for various reasons but the fact that two thirds are holding back in it what is otherwise a pretty good economy is notable this is the highest it's been four years I'm Still in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years\nUm but it's a reverse the trend where you'd see where\nThe economy got better and better each successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now the sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we had seen a in several years prior to that\nYou referenced it in a couple of your remarks there but this was a solid economy right to wages are creeping up the tax cut pour more money in Americans paychecks with why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned the growth of household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up at the last few years\nThat was initially when we started looking at five or five years or so ago that was the top ... and people limited they're spending was the cause their incomes weren't going up what we noticed over the past several years though is that as a income growth became more broad based\nThat became less and less the case that was the reason people were holding back and instead people were saying well I'm holding back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin\nA couple of other things that that they're watching the percentage of Americans a point to too much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this over the last five years\nAnd I think that's consistent with a rising interest rate environment that better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up but that the higher debt burdens coupled with rising interest rates\nAre they get shows that there are some people out there are starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then we even an assault economy there's there's there are still those that are\nYou know those ever present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back as soon as the you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending by generation what's that break down\nYeah you know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and the little inclination to save more as the reason falling back\nSkew younger so long ago some particular lead the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend ... also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on my spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nUh most inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to say more money\nBut that's changing ... baby boomers those are the sandwich generation\nA couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back on their spending as their younger counterparts\nBut when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers that are in the workforce stagnant income is still very much an issue\nThat much of this is a recession hanging over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say\nOh what a generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking this up on their own\nSo certainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this\nIn a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about in the past ... millennials have a greater inclination towards saving a they have a little less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations\nAnd I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of voter millennials or\nShe is the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings I'm just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had in the fact that we see that manifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in this case it's that that focus on saving limiting the spending in order to save more money", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city":
