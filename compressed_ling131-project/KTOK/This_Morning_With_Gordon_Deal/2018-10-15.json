Georgia election\nShe wanted to get new are largely African American voters to the pole and create a new electorate or to help Democrats wet and it's a big battle for big gamble she definitely has that are backing that good democratic year but she's running neck and neck with the Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp\nWho was again a Trump endorsed candidate someone who's very very conservative especially\nOn social and cultural issues and uh you know there's also a big battle over over voting rights in the state where I'm you know he he had secretary of state camp one after Abrams for something to organize and trying to get new voters registered to vote in the future so\nAgain this is a polarized election leopards is right in a state that is the lead lead with Republican but it's one of those states Democrats like they can compete in in years to come\nAnd speak with Josh cross our politics editor at National Journal these pieces called battle of the bases will set tone for twenty twenty you point out in the story too about the risk of running left\n[noise] yeah I mean the conventional wisdom and I I I buy the conventional wisdom is that when you go to carnival after going to alienate the wing moderate voters a typical it makes a difference in in competitive elections that were Democrats are betting on it I I can understand why what what area of the case\nBut I think this is such a good democratic environment there's such you know here ... anti Trump anger\nEspecially among suburban voters that it may not matter who Democrats nominate they might be able to nominate someone who is a little bit\nTo the left or the suburban motors are so so uh you know\nSuch a problem with President Trump they look at the Republican Party in water where it's going and let me just looked straight democratic ticket ... let me just go on a strict party ticket and the Democrats so environment and if you want to have a candidate that's going to be a little more productive and this is the type of political environment Democrats Woodward would a would achieve that goal\nThat gets to I Believe your point about this competing culture clashes you call it in the Trump era\nYeah I mean this is the middle of this you know the the time for a century the timer moderation is is that here in ... which Trump is rallying his base Democrats are playing to the resistance I there's not much room for something like a like a ... brat as it was a former Democratic governor in Tennessee you're trying to run to the middle\nHe founded on a trip to the to the center of the people who\nWant to take five the molecular\nExplain what's happening in Arizona then that's a somewhat similar maybe to Florida in Georgia\nYou start to see the Republican incumbent cannot as Trump ... to ... to other Republican so it's a little bit different but again running against a guy who they would they would go see a would be the first Hispanic governor in Arizona and and it over the years\nAnd go see again on such an immigration which is a very touchy issue in Arizona I worry about whether they're much more conservative on border security issues\nAnd he's Josh Josh
