court\nAdheres and kind of regulatory challenges choose to regulation that the federal agencies issue as well as separation of powers issues to basically at hand or anything on that or any of the uh

eight teen fifty one when recordkeeping began\nMore now from Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel is with us lives mourning mourning jobs and just how bad was Michael\n... morning Gordon yeah it's not every day that you see a category for making us landfall but uh you know Michael was pretty impressive and that uh you know a lot of these hurricanes when they approach the U.S still tend to either hold serve\nOr the week and a little bit of the approach land but Michael is intensifying just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning and it's I was making Lincoln for [noise] so yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and do they give you a perspective on that\nOr they're only been three a continental US category five hurricane on record Andrew Camille in uh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was a ... this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... moved north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened here by rain\n[laughter] yeah that's right right now ah the center of Michael is now just over a or Europe gust of Georgia and it spread it all of the rain into a parts of the Carolinas\nThe Appalachians and ah over the next twenty four hours it will just blew up pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas\nThe southeast Virginia no spread some rain or as well along parts of the north east seaboard including a sell these New England we produce or the inch rain or so on its northern plank it to a New York city Philadelphia\nBut fortunately by friday or this thing will finally be out to sea will be done with it\nOr they think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\n[laughter] well that's true you know or you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's um you know if you think about the places where hurricane could hit and do the most damage a of the places where Michael didn't get it didn't hit New Orleans it didn't hit Tampa\nOr they need Houston or so it's a it's a relatively lower population swat in the ... still hit very hard\nBut ah I guess if there is a small all sorts of relief and certainly as far as the the the the overall damaged figure from this instead of hit a relatively unpopulated area the Gulf Coast\nOr why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that shouldn't be the case you to Florida as good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time to pack up\n[laughter] yeah I mean they're part of it as part of it is due to becoming so intense so ah so close to landfall you know it just kept intensifying intensify and that's something we we never liked to see but\nCertainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watches and warnings out well ahead of this they usually put a watches out a good forty eight hours ahead of time and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance of but\nI think the intensity and ferocity of it\nUh you know I I personally did not expect a borderline get five later today so I think that'd be a benefactor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel uh I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations and what's the rest of the season look like either I don't know next couple of days or weeks [laughter] well\nYou know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left the typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems on the central eastern Atlantic not worry about it was at the deed\nOr there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week or that will probably stay up buried in Central America and that could be a flood threat so you don't see any us threats\nOver the next week or so but again the hurricanes\nYou can go into November leaks do could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November Man that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October\n[noise] no you're absolutely right or really the peak of the hurricane season are usually goes for the last um the last two weeks of August through early October
