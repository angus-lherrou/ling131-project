listening to America's first knew this morning with Gordon Deal\nWith is welcome into Wednesday there are competing\nAdvertisements representing an effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump\nThere's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up it's no secret president and can\nThe watcher of Fox News and particular and we know that because he is frequently tweeting in real time as he watches particularly Fox and friends in the morning and then also um\nDuring Hannity in the evening sometimes references Lou Dobbs them over at the Fox business channel and so the general public notice and still have lobbyists and DC and\nLobbyist have found that in effect give way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his favorite TV program so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild looks like a ... what example whose airing what\nDon't we took a look at the story now because there is a big fight to that's been going on over ethanol and so groups that are\nSavoring [laughter] you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been um advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and groups and also oppose that\nAre sort of counter messaging to him during the same programs\nAs you know to be influenced by them\nFor what we can see is that he doesn't gauge sometimes directly after\nAn ad that pops up on TALK [laughter] um this happened to win a group of a steel workers with advertising during boxing fans in March you know as the ad came up the president started talking about the issue suggesting that he had seen me at 'em\nAnd then sort of on the other side here if you remember last year billionaire Tom dire who's constantly and fights with the president and have started an impeachment movement I'm\nKind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noticed that and tweeted about it right away\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you know what to do the ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the programs himself have really strong viewership um during this administration viewership has raised and and and so have the ad rates and we've actually seen some lobbying from\nYou know notice that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wine but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategist also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president um has expressed a dislike for programs on on\nThose two channels there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that people who are influential with the president may see some types of advertising and and a flag it to him\nWell that ah that that sounds I guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin ... from the group need to impeach how he feels so you just suspect that the president's watching a nosy can talking to was from like a little elbow and the ribs gone to bed\nExactly exactly um and then also sort of interesting to hear the president has been very disparaging of Saturday Night live as\nA show that's not funny any longer and one that he says he doesn't watch but there's some evidence that he was watching and groups are also starting to put up ads during Saturday Night live as well\nAs Julie it's Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie by go with\nMore sort of the program as well if you buy the white streams\nAre thinking

the short but we saw Gordon Moore the shore float yesterday as Michael was still further out in the Gulf and we saw\nWater levels three to four feet above normal yesterday and today I have a feeling

unless they expressly opt out more from Wall Street Journal reporter Cameron McWhorter in Atlanta Campbell is going on\nWell it's a very strange thing because Republicans as a rule don't like these motor voter bills which are bills which\n... which are passed in several states which allow people when they go to register or re read your renewed their driver's license they automatically get registered to vote unless they opt out let's say purposely chose to opt out and so what it's done in those days to go out to\nA lot more registration and it's been fought by a lot of Republicans who consider it a away too because it could be misused this you know where people who have driver's licenses but aren't necessarily said as soon as\nSomehow end up voting at a could cause problems so that has been the case in Georgia but about two years ago\nOr the department of drivers services here\nJust made this little change in the document on the advice of their attorney general and I can't get a real straight answer as to why they did it but what it did was it basically created a motor voter situation in Georgia without passing a bill and so the result is\nThe scene registrations go through the roof here way more than any a\nA voter Dr efforts by democratic leaning groups are I mean registrations are way up among all groups African Americans and Asians Hispanics white people to a lesser extent I mean it's really brought out a lot of new voters\nBend the Republican governors signed off on it right\n[laughter] right and again that everyone gets very skittish where I started 'cause he has to why they did that\nBut the uh the Democrats and meanwhile the Democrats are are somewhat skittish about it because they want to talk about voter suppression that's one of their talking points and the truth of the matter is if you look at the wrong numbers of people who are\nOut of the possibility of voting in Georgia it's increased dramatically in Kabul digits way higher than the population has increased over the last two years\nSo as one observer or expert in your story said just because there's an increase in registration for a particular group that does not equal turn out all the time\nOh exactly so but now the battle becomes turnout so talking to various experts that I spoke to regarding\nThese bill they say look what's what's it just moves are credible so we'd have more people registered to vote so they're allowed to vote now it's up to the parties which should be to engage voters and get them to the polls so\nThat's certainly what both parties here are doing ah regarding the governor's race in Georgia which has huge Syrian tanks and all the polls indicate extremely close\n... speaking with Wall Street journal reporter camera in McWhorter about his piece entitled Georgia's motor voter Dr boosts eligible voters in groups leaning democratic I saw the tightest together now because we have this very closely watched in what appears to be highly intense battle for the governorship in Georgia\n[noise] right so Stacey Abrams is an African American woman running on the Democratic ticket she is the ah she would be the first African American woman to ever be a ... in any anywhere in the United states where she to win\nA ... a Brian Kemp who is a stalwart Republican the secretary of state\nOr who is I'm just trying to keep up a a dominant Republican dominance of or the governorship in Georgia and try to carry on the legacy of previous governors like Nathan Deal who is now leading\nWho's very pro business but also very conservative and anyway and so these two candidates are really clashing they are ready to both raising tons of money in and out of state\nThey are ... ... a a hammering each other whenever possible [laughter]\nAnd they are bowl I'm scrambling to get voters to the polls the this will play and you know if Stacey Abrams can bring a for example more African American voters to the polls which according to primary she did do that in the in the in the Democratic primary if those people show up\nAnd enough numbers and Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans who are um who tend to lean democratic come to the polls are the Republicans have a real tough time and ah they they were very aware of that though I mean and they're\nDoing all kinds of things including trying to get um [noise] make inroads into these minority groups because they know that that's a that's a weak point for them\nIs Kim Wall Street Journal reporter camera in McWhorter who's based in Atlanta [noise]\nMore some program is one of my friends\nAt
