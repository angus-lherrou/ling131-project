meanwhile are featured in tens of thousands of ads Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie biker which has been looking at the data Julie what have you found\nThat bottom line is that both President Trump and minority leader Nancy Pelosi are turning up in quite a bit of mid term advertising um specific to President Trump we found that he it's only topped by two other issues in

sometimes positively and sometimes negatively\nThat's right and there's actually there's\nA surprising amount of positive Trump ads out there when we found that even I'm In a Democratic Senate at he's turning up any positive supportive way that set the scene and places like Indiana West Virginia where the Democratic senator\nIt's trying to hold onto his seat and said that Trump won quite a bit and

the audience getting a a completely different picture of what's going on an election or race than the English language audience\nAnd we found that that's not really happening however what you see is that issues that they may highlight when they're talking to a Latino audience um might be one that they put over in the background or any English so in other words not their position but perhaps a little more\nTalk about a border control um when you're talking to the English audience if you're in let's say tax is I'm a little less talk about ... if you are a rich Rick Scott\nIn Florida so you know you just choose to emphasize different that\nWhat about the actually speaking Spanish in the ad is that happening\nIt's happening a little bit um you know if anybody watched Bill Nelson and Rick Scott finish their senatorial debate in Florida you'll notice that the image closing statements they try and talk a little bit of Spanish I sort of it seems to be kind of a hung jury on how much that actually helps for the most part\nThe Latino but I spoke with said that they tend to get the candidates some credit for trying um but there's some charity to kill that they feel that they can do is just trying to memorize a couple of words so he can act\nLike you care and that's not going to live there they want to to you know George W Bush's elections in two thousand two thousand and four where

wasn't hiding anything from them you see\nJeb Bush's brother is fluent in Spanish but that didn't really have much on the presidential trail even though he was governor of Florida yeah they don't work

only at\n... so what is just to drill down on that a little bit out as ... the Ted Cruz message differ he plays on more of the uh the Hispanic heritage than he might in the English speaking at\nExactly uh eight minutes on that account or they call it the American dream um and of course that's you know that's really I think a child it resonates with a lot of the immigration immigrant
