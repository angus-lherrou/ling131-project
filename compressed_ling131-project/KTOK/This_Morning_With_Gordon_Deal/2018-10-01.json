people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes\nI Can't remember this is a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes wide again just like give aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they pulled off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped and I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone\nHow weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds\nIt was in those sim woods where I heard\nThis ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound and I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the\nAudio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George ... used to play it\nI think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for

ghost coast they realize that that's what I heard I\nWas up um the Willamette to national forest or love ill or between um mount bachelor and three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watching the stars and hanging out and then they'll likely music stuff sometimes I just kind of hang out somewhere where it's quiet and there's nobody around for\nHours up there and went down to looking at star soup and ... and I heard that same sound that he's talking about is just as I Know what you're talking about [noise] um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kind of like a what are you doing up here you know and and I've\nGot a second guessed but oil it's really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three to five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psyche can personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd me I jumped in my car so I got out of there um and\nYou know I never really piece together what was you know I'm like Crawford I mean do a lot of reading wasn't a lot of course coasters and theorists down it was like oh my God that's what it is it you know I'm a musician so I listen to overtones and frequency and stuff a

joined now by cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times and what kind of security that we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to a band aid security though are really not and I'm much of a different shape than we weren't together sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aid by the way what's what's what's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's the idea guessed it prior to two dozen fixing it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um the server it's like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line\nThe jets will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing that we know about that I'm also have a patch available\nAnd it will tell the states where it found a vulnerability and I'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis defeat when the um the customer has a patch to them\nSo they did that to a few states before um the two dozen sixty election and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the mountain is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it's getting at only the Internet facing system could not getting at the core ... they're supposedly not connected to the ... not getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's often not touching um water the election management systems and these are the system to sit in a county headquarters a there used to program the voting machines and they're also used to calculate the votes so these are actually the most critical instance not the Internet they think there's some\nOkay so if if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence or are you saying there are there are some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our elections isn't the act as a four glitz going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want letters to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produced paper trail\nOn and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't that\nYou point out there's really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\nUm yes so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can be altered um have mandated California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines\nI'm happy to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled\nOut a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail um so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um state the county election officials are not looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\nWe're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cybersecurity journalists also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of ...\nElection security how do we get so vulnerable\nWe got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nUh in that case I'm sure everyone recall the dangling Chad while you know that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington she decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do we count a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh it's done and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all and that's how we got from what we have today\nIs Kim Kim Zetter cyber security journalist Nineteen

is returning though in different forms from before more from ... is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how do you see it\nGot to Christ basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the presence of risk weather was bank\nThere is who thought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in price they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we're individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether to the regulations\nOr attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what types of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts and crises but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting you wrote household and investors are much wary or of risk what the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example like it used to be that aren't really year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several rates for that one is that well I'm wearing aging country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who can buy a house\nI and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand in the crisis and they've kind of learn to sort of like be more cautious they're investing and so we see an investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted\nYou don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know he used to try to hold equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [laughter]\nSure you have your ... there but it really kind of the exception you know ... it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nWhat people want is to not start the next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new businesses being formed does actually historically quite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially a people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nNo we're speaking with Greg ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned it before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or are they related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat as I say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people forced to capitulate and fell into that so in some sense pessimism is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nIn that similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects you're less likely to you've got to bust in a recession now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances but up about which is the risk to start to grow\nAnd if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risk of a kind of like goes away that sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill encounters a barrier tried to find a way around it and and we hear happening now\nSome of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like heavily companies those are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds so you some sense skill at risk out there it's just informed that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system will be safer as a result\n... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal reminder by the way we can connect on social media you
