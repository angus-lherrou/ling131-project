Republicans and save the house before he retires USA Today congressional reporter Eliza Collins got the scoop it was what do we know\nHe has a really aggressive final sprint he's like he's going to twelve states he's going to campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbents who currently serve with him a handful are\nOn incoming aries helping their incoming Republican candidates specifically like the person trying to take his seat because he's retiring\nWould you keep this trying to schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nWell he always have a pretty aggressive schedule because he had to read a lot can lots of money for the party keeps raids that were seven eight million dollars on\nThem for the party with a lot of that going to keep these candidates safer attempt to keep these candidates saint Pete certainly doesn't need it he's not running again and keep an aggressive schedule but it is new for him to be hammering sort of\nJust you know basically like a ... a day a multiple districts and\nIt just go kind of on his final sprint that we should remember he's retiring\nAnd it would really help is like the if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves\nLike jeez are so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members then as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his yard\nYeah I thought this was really interesting as well I've spent\nThe last couple of years covering the Freedom Caucus and did that for a been a thorn in his I'd be there for a trip conservative fire rate members of his party who will threaten\nOr in some cases have actually send legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough\nRepublicans in a two hundred and Eighteen votes in order to pass anything\nAnd they can do right now on their\nOwn um but they need buy in from the Freedom Caucus because there's about three dozen of that so they have power when they sort of voting bloc and they've done that and they've threatened to do that and so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases\nSo I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat\nWho is sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus he's not just a rank and file member but he's one of the people making these decisions on what the whole thing getting what they'll vote for it but he's all three of them are facing really competitive races\nSo we're speaking with allies are Collins congressional reporter at USA Today she's written a piece about how outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan is hitting the campaign trail to help other GOP candidates but what kind of messaging well he does or does it change from Canada to candidate\nSo it will change from Canada to candidate what he'll do will change from candidate to Canada in some places that might be like a business or or you know a rally\nIn some places it might just be a closed door fundraiser it really depends on the candidate but his messaging basically it's like you're better off of Republican leadership on the economy there talking about opioid legislation which is of course is actually very bipartisan push and absolutely groundbreaking\nThat the house and Senate were able to push this giant opioids package that was signed into under President Trump but Republican there's a lot of their names on these tons and tons of tiny little bells all grouped together is a lot of vulnerable Republicans had their names on those bills\nSo he'll be campaigning on all that but the message basically being\nYou're better off at a Republican leadership and Democrats\nThey say are going further and further can\nOr how will he use President Trump if at all\nBut I imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going into these are really vulnerable districts on some of them even being counted out already by Republican strategist you said you know we'll probably won't when that's not to move our money elsewhere brain payments that none of them are counted out\nBut these districts where the Democrat\nIs making a big strong place it probably not\nJust tricks to align yourself really close with the president in last year doing an event with just the Republican base but right now sort of more of a moderating force he obviously with the vice presidential candidate Mitt Romney and\nSo he comes in he doesn't illicit really strong feelings from either side of people might not like his agenda that he's not as controversial because President Trump so it seems that they're hoping he'll go in and kind of be able to soften the Republican Party image and

I I think that the timing would actually work\nUh you know he can say look we're we're going to do a thorough investigation make sure we really know what happened then that could easily take you another four weeks or so so that this will whatever happens comes after the elections which ... which point he has a little more freedom\nAnd then you have to say well what would what what kind of sanctions would be a I don't think we've ever actually put limits not not in the last thirty or forty years anyway we've never sort of put an embargo on um Saudi oil coming to the United states I think it's hard to imagine that happening\nWhat the United States has done with regard to human rights abuses in other countries\nIs they have sanctioned particular companies you say you could make it hard for the companies do business to do business and that's where you say well they can't uh we don't want them doing a business for us financial\nInstitutions that that can um you know really a cause some pain and then there's this other thing called the Magnitsky Act which was originally passed by Congress\nOr with regard to Russia but that can be used with other countries as well not allow the U.S government put sanctions on individual so you can say\nA certain name individuals are not permitted to do business with us financial institutions anywhere and that you can see their assets in the United states if they have any and do some other things that are they the government here is use that against some Russians are and it's pretty effective it makes life very complicated for the targeted people\nAnd we're speaking with Yahoo Finance columnist ... Newman is piece is called why Trump is going soft on Saudi Arabia and he points to reasons like Iran and oil um how easy would it be by the way a for Saudi Arabia to tinker with the price of oil\nI think it would be very easy and I think that's the problem so the Saudis have said very clearly didn't that are there any sanctions on us\nWe are going to respond with what they should that words were greater action and you know I think that clearly referring to oil prices so they hatch people it within Saudi Arabia share speaking on behalf of the uh\nRuling family they're saying you know we can do prices right now west Texas crude is arranged Seventy dollars\nA day or staying up we could easily just restrict supply and prices go up to eighty dollars a hundred dollars um you know the Saudis are still the biggest oil producer in the world and they could\nThey could easily ... supply enough to push oil prices almost as high as they want to show what they do that um I you know I\nIt's hard it is really kind of a head scratcher because it's a little bit hard to she this outbreak of sort of oil or petroleum warfare to ah when all these countries really do need each other I mean you shot Saudi Arabia the United states\nUh United States does me Saudi oil even though we produce a lot more of our own oil they used to show that you know as we've seen that so many times that so many different ways\nI mean middle Middle Eastern politics it's so complicated or you're in large part because shells oil you enjoy all\n... records Yahoo Finance columnist written Newman based in New
