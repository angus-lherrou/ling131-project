to America's wars in the morning when Gordon\nWith us walk them into Monday in a year where Democrats are considered the favorites to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular where races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final stretch here have become closer than people expected they would\nAnd we're seeing that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge him out [laughter]\nSo maybe a forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent so districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have come to satisfied with the president\nStarts a one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people into coming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler\nUm she has been in office and she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but this year has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats garnered more votes than congressman\nButler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as did the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor so it's an unusual race there in that\nUm that hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn longest campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points um [noise] so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight race\nWell All right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger and democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender\nGap and and it reveals that women are\nShow more of a preference for a democratic controlled house\nAnd are also more energized to vote this year so you know it's a truly them of mid term that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like women are more place to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blow out for him there got it\nWe're speaking with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tightened as mid term elections near to about down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes this is an interesting race um would all is definitely being outraged by Carolyn a boy do who is also a professor she's at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been some one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down in the ticket and that\nUm do could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and at some of those you know they can see the Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seat in democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hearty\nUh and then the second ... Republicans are optimistic about it's currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had the Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada um this is a little bit\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seems to be um [noise] a little bit more of a stretch their\nWings Christina it's Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson\nThe program is walking by different you know was not Martin making the lottery\nThe centerpiece of your retirement plan despite to lotteries current size right but you know what is Martin\nGoing to zip recruiter dot com slash Gordon do hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding you\nZip recruiter finds them for you it's powerful matching technology skins thousands of resumes then identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast that's why the recruiter\nIs rated number one by employers in the U.S in just reading comes from hiring sites on trust pilot\nWith over one thousand reviews\nAnd right now our listeners to try recruiter for free at this exclusive Web address zip recruiter\nDot com slash Gordon that zip recruiter dot com slash Gordon zip recruiter the smartest way to hire you want to fish and sea four out of five companies say they find they qualified candidate on the zip recruiter site within just a single day\nIt was\n\n\nJust like chatting with your neighbors\nSitting around talking about the latest got all the\nBully we're going to lose your allies as we can be eighties or Yahoo dumber\nI Can't believe I'm not surprised but it just it just made yeah she was a Karen\nHughes radio one thousand cagey okay you can't just wander around being done all your life ...\nPlace to talk\nFor the Steinway piano which John Lennon wrote imagine George said I Know that when my fingers touch the keys that Steinway I Will feel truly blessed and partying with my money has never been much of a problem just asked my accountant the singer outbid Robbie Williams and the oasis rather\nThere's or look back at this\nLater much later and we heard something\nThan ... steps on the back porch creeping then more costs\nSeven thirty six thirty central on Fox\nAlso and he said the economy intelligence to get look as bad but it's such a one hour premiere at headlines central on TV ads Thursday the vampire diaries the universe expands once again what legacy as they know about the original during Danielle rose retinal and that David via Thursday\nAnd nine eight central following an all news supernatural\nThat's your TV tipped off on my heart radio\n\nReading the world's your door every morning on the merits of course this morning with your\nRing with us we'll Monday October\nTwenty two Gordon Deal Jennifer ... some of our top stories and headlines migrants caravan crosses from Guatemala and just southern Mexico Russia warns about the U.S backing out of a nuclear arms treaty\nTreasury secretary in Saudi Arabia in the midst of controversy over the death of a journalist in sports sheets quarterback Patrick more homes now has twenty two touchdown passes in his first aid game that's a record and why statistically this may be\nThe best Red Sox World Series teams that story in about twenty minutes\nPresident Trump says acts on the Federal Reserve complicated series of them\nAlready challenging decisions facing the central bank more from Wall Street Journal economics reporter Nick tomorrow's Nick what's up here\nThat what the president has been saying about the Federal Reserve it really doesn't have a reason for them [noise] us presidents have criticized the fed before George H W.

me want to just walk into the Monday there is an influx\nOf young mostly democratic women in their twenties and thirties running for office this year one fifth\nOf the female Democratic House candidates are under forty\nA sort of them are women of color hundreds more are running for state legislature Wall Street journal national political reporter Janet Hook says the diverse crop of young candidates marks a departure from an older generation of women with ambition who tended to postpone political careers until their families were established Janet what's up here\nYou know there's been a lot of attention paid during this election cycle to the record number of women\nAll that are running for office but within that\nUm there's this really interesting trend of there being more younger women running I'm sort of under forty women in their twenties and thirties um and it's interesting to me because there's been a kind of a career pattern for women and politics I'm In the past\nIt's much like like the clear pattern in in in other I'm wanting to work where women would tend to wait until their children are grown before they take the plunge into politics and the classic case if this was Nancy Pelosi had five kids\nDidn't run for office until the I'm the youngest one was sixteen\nI'm and she was forty seven by then by the time she started her political career\nUm and I think what we've seen in twenty Eighteen weight on women running scientists that women are also are a little bit less willing to wait that there's a sense of urgency cynically among democratic women who are running there's a sense of urgency\nAbout running you know we need to be part of the movement to also part of a broader idea that women can start their careers and their families at the same time\nYeah so what ... what happens if a I'm a ... what we might consider it a significant number of them when I look at what kind of message I guess get sent\n[noise] well I mean it's been broadly among Democrats a real clamoring for kind of generational change I mean there have been a lot of complaints about the leadership in Congress being all baby boomers and older\nUh so I think that it would kind of contribute to a sense of [noise] of a movement powered um they also I think women in general and young women in particular bring\nMore focus and attention to a women's issues you know the treatment of women family issues um and you know I talked to a political scientist who is actually kind of study did the style of leadership that women have brought to Congress and they she concluded that with more women in Congress and more with younger women\nThat there might actually be a more collaborative approach to decision making\nYou know I thought it was interesting too is the one line in your story about how some of these young women are already making a difference to federal election commission ruled the campaign funds can be used to pay childcare expenses\nRight my story actually features a woman who's running for the house in New York on Long Island her name is Lou been Gretchen Shirley and she's thirty seven years old and she was thinking about running for the house and kind of a reluctant at first because she had a one year old and a three year old\nShe went ahead and um started running and was kind of relying on her mom for for childcare help and just when the pace of the campaign got too much she really felt like she needed to hire outside help didn't have a lot of money she petitioned the FCC to see if she could use campaign tons to pay for childcare\nAnd lo and behold they should this ruling that said you could and it was kind of a landmark that says\nI'm basically kind of recognizing the reality of when parents run for\nOffice that if they have children I'm part of the campaign has to be finding a way to take care of the kids\nWith Janet Hook national political reporter at the wall Street Journal she's going to be entitled to young women aren't waiting to seek political power I use it to their mobilizing not just as candidates but also as voters I guess that probably goes hand in hand but explain some of the numbers [noise]\nWell um the there's a democratic um data analytics firm called target smart that analyzes voter rolls and\nIt looked at um twenty five states that had held primaries to look at the turnout of voters in and they broke it down by different categories and one of the categories that they looked at was the difference between a younger voters motors and older voters by you know kind of looking at turnout by age group and what they found was\nHas always been the case younger voters um their turnout rate is lower than older voters as we know you know old older voters really turn out in large numbers\nFor

their manager doesn't have an accurate understanding of how they're spending their time that's no way to work no way to manage either guidance from Katie Hill editor at ... dot com Katie what'd you look at\nIt as an intimate came out showing that I'm about thirty seven percent employees say they feel like they're manager doesn't have much clue what they're spending their time on all day and asked a bunch of Korea experts you know do managers actually know what their employees are doing and most of them said sometimes but often they really don't have a ... you know they don't know what you're doing\nWhat you're working on and frankly that the biggest problem because they're the ones deciding on your competition and whether you get promoted and if they don't really know what you're working on that is not good for you [laughter]\nI'm Ellen says quiet and pies bad right if you're not you're not constantly it can be not constantly but frequently communicate with your manager about what you do what you accomplished it just can be a real a real problem\nIs it possible that we're just all that busy we can't even pay attention to what I was doing the nature of the day's environment I don't know\nI mean I think certainly that's true in some jobs and a lot of times you know your manager managing the people above that and dealing with their request they just want you to come you know they're they're just not fully paying attention and a lot of buses [noise]\nNever had your job you know some people get promoted into being a Boston they never actually had the job that say you can they don't even know what it takes to get your jobs at some ... that's a problem too [noise] um so yeah all of it like there is not quite fully aware of what exactly you know you're tapping away on the keyboard doing all day\nMonth or so there's that phrase managing up right as you referenced like the the the manager has to manage his managers or managers\nAre what are the keys you're right you got your manager manager and you have to somehow let him or her know what it is that you're doing all the time I can hear it had to do it it's ... it's really simple but I you you see people don't really do that is okay to get a face to face meeting with the boss put it on the calendar sit down for half an hour\nAnd ... meeting about how you can work effectively together right I mean ideally you do that when you start a new job that I think it's worth doing it and your current job paying when it made about how we can work effectively together\nAnd then during that meeting ask your manager how they want to be kept in the ... you know hey I'd love to um give you you know some regular status updates just say you always know I'm here in the loop about what I'm doing it must be like okay\nThat sounds great I'd I'd love to know what you're doing um you know may tell them it's going to be brief or whatever and then ask them you know how do you want to be kept in a lab joining a phone call or do you want me to do email doing a face to face meeting [noise]\nUm and then you have a bunch of ideas what is his status I've taken a town that just a quick email\nAt every Friday that just says you know they tend to five things that you worked on and what you accomplished get get get into what they want with a status update but it's again it's so important to be getting their needs updates on a regular basis that way they know exactly what you're doing what you're accomplishing otherwise that all that kind of could get neck\nKatie Hill at ... dot com thirty minutes after the

make them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that Honda's our susceptible\nTo everybody that this is a crime that has existed for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although some of it as well are being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that beat airbags can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases they break into the vehicle the they basically ... out of the steering wheel and then the so and and the black market\nAnd it's in connection\nWith what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blows the airbag or is this tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens when you need to get your bag replaced you have a couple of different options course most people to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop get to replace their um some people ever going to get it done this either going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable type of repair shop and that's where\nA lot of these tests airbags end up being sold if you actually go on ... for example in the search for this you will see their airbags being sold on line so it's it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealerships something you're not going to end up accidently buying a user airbag or something but there is a market for these things\nShe saw it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happen to be more of them perhaps on in parking lots of ...\nWell I definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's along with targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact they're popular but it doesn't make much sense to me is white only because in talking to the police\nAnd various markets um you know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on this show you know it does you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with\nThe actual specific Arabic actors or something and exactly what it is I'm\nProbably the the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nYeah so at the the ... ah what uses a nice ... kinda strips away the covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at

either they hit dozens of vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night show you know it's it's definitely I'm not a difficult thing to think about it this is like you know as a laptop off the seat in the car I mean if the left towards a thousand dollars [laughter]\nWorth so there was a big incentive for the ... and you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so the incentive is also gotten up\nWell we're seeing with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in Seattle
