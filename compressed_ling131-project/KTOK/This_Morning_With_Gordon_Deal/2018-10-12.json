that's disturbing you know are you space and time\nUh right now doesn't seem to allow information to flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year to a record my dreams and at first I tried a member of the seven days a portable tape recorders are kind of clunky\nMhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I think like recording play at the same time right right\nYeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit the button so I went back and just writing things down on paper and of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a drain I figured that method for that that took me some of\nWas reliable and one night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual ally and then I decided but what happened ... thing and I ... is a is a I was in a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd

to win severe weather strikes radio one thousand K T o K\nMorning workout you are listening to America's first news this morning\nForgiven for going\nAlong with ... thanks for\nJoining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura could just do the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\n... four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rate are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking\nAbout an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there years ago we saw rate\nIt's like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I Am a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I covered with all the time and I know that right to to be cheaper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean that's certainly what I've heard that the ... than is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nI'm with that said though I think that we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense that it has been in the past and I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw\nA huge run up and prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the higher rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a more or less a strong incentive to refinance [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing above price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of the more\nExpensive markets um but I went to some of the hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more up a price production so\nWhat does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy\nI think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump within and rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on and are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high but I Do think for buyers that just got\nExhausted um for for a bidding war Roseanne cash buyers and the real friends say that we've had in the market\nThat has really cold and so I think for buyers who want a little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices down or the bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nPortion of the program is brought you buy Brooklyn and did you know the Brooklyn in sheets are named the winner of the best

compared to you know the interests that you can pay on a on a payday loan is is relatively small um I talked to another company called daily pay and they said their fees are more similar to an ATM fee and they max out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee\nUm which you know is an inexpensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than from those interest rates ended up being\nMurray as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks and people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reasons for not I think going into this story I thought you know there must be some tax free then or some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that\nUm their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so um you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nSo it already is actually um you know ... ... ... and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they've worked with a company called green dot to do that and square\nUm and so now that those type of gigs condom your workers are used to doing that that has kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payment cycles um you know\nEveryday workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't this happened for me [laughter] so without conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and is kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow for traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby your company to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of\nThe national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that that the benefit for their workers some of these companies um are you know that that allow you to outsource both are presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often\nSo we may see it sort of position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively soon\nNext Maria Maria la money market watches thirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas first

wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend to know how widespread is the day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we are actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far [noise]\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTurnout why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend to a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits news story and fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticed and fewer teacher absence is\nWe're speaking with ... to the wall Street Journal now if you were shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there\nThan ours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum\nRequired hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already seat in the hours that there is just basically add in time at the end of that day\nThat each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a ... for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still\nTo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at our ... you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know how many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap day care and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals a doodle nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve meals because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting\nYou know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts you use it for a day\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of 'em I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love it it's you know it's all you know let them take kind of a mini vacation if they want to get away for an extended

joins us now tell us what you found out about talking to the owner of a battery business in Texas\nSurveying a lot of different business owners here we go fight is to get their opinions on the Arabs\nOr some don't like them but some actually do like them and one of the guys I interviewed was a guy named queen Robin and run the company in Texas that rebuilds or industrial equipment or alternate errors in starters on automobiles and on um some bigger equipment used in the ... energy industry\nAnd he's getting hit for he's a he she's the tears from both sides so um he he has to pay more now for some materials that he uses his business which is rebuilding a feminist equipment\nBut he also favors the terrorists because she compete against a new equipment new alternatives and starters that are made in China so the price of competing product is going to go up\nAnd he thinks that's going to help his business eventually he thinks that may actually help raise his own prices eventually got him a for the higher costs cheese and himself because his own costs have gone up on account of the show it's complicated I mean that you know the waiters plays out in the real world\nIs not nearly as a symbol at some of the sound bite you might hear politicians are spouting on TV\n[noise] what kind of price supplies um is he looking at it is it that the ten percent or higher\nWhich I think the ones that are affecting him that the cost increases affecting him or the steel and aluminum tariffs\nShow you know he buys some parts from suppliers who in turn to get their stuff from China or\nA show in some cases their pay either a ten percent tariff now an additional temperature works twenty five percent ... also the steel and aluminum cherish applies not just to imports from China but from most countries\nEach show a imported steel and aluminum is getting more expensive show he got he got notified by one supplier or the price that the price of the product if any are just going up or shut down any ... and which aren't working I brought up and at some point you're going to have to raise his own prices\nIn order to cover that increase in cost\nYou know there if you're if you're the seller in this case you have to figure out well as my customers are going to pay the extra money and how do I sort of carefully raise my prices without of sending my customers away\nJoy he plans to do is he going to get out and cost until he sees the competing products going up in price which it has to do because it's getting more expensive also and he says well not product goes up the price that is what he's going to raise prices so ah approaches what kind of go off at the same time\nWe're sticking with that Yahoo columnist Rick Newman Rick in talking to this gentleman could you tell it all it's his feelings have changed in either direction on the terrorists\n[laughter] that's interesting because when he first um reached out to me saying he'd be happy to talk about this she was totally in favor of the terrorists and that was before\nHe got the notification for his own supplier that cost you are going up by the time I actually talked to him he said well there's been an interesting turn a because yesterday he said yesterday said yesterday in fact\nUm I got notified by my own fires and my costs are going up John more on account of the terrorists but I think it's going to help\nOr on the retail and he said look I still favor the trend terrorists are in one of the points you made is that it his business he or she is a lot of busy us businesses small businesses such as just disappear\nBecause uh they cannot compete with\nA cheap imported products from China\nAnd in many cases they make the case that the court and products are low quality products that there\nAre there they're not built flashed 'em that you're ... you know if you're the country are getting something inferior but a lot of times uh you just don't know that or you don't care and you know when you have to make at some point in time you just have to go with the cheaper products\nSo he's one of these people who feels that the Trump terrorists may actually rectify launched any problem with the demise of all these businesses in the United states\nThanks direct that's Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman's\nPortion of the program is brought you buy Harry's you've heard Gordon talked for years

didn't work relatively well in the ... you know the sort of vertical\nCompanies of the past where it was a chain of command that went up and down I think now we're having much more collaboration among teams across different departments\nUm innovation is coming from\nAll levels at all times and it's really hard for a command and control leader to keep a finger in every pie humble leaders are better able to kind of move among all the teams and inspire really open honest conversation and interaction so that team's work better together\nOn it's more than a change even in just quote companies want to change in the structure of how we're getting work done\nSo what's wrong with the leader who in the past was charming and charismatic\nAbsolutely nothing and in fact some of those people can also be humble it isn't that if you're a humble year like this\nSneak person who sits in a corner I'm humbled people can also be ambitious for their team's\nNot necessarily for themselves and they can be charismatic to they can get excited about the mission that we all share and really get people pumped up off what doesn't work so much is the authoritarian\nI Know better than you just follow my lead leader because those people tend to get yes is no matter what they say and you know it's a it's set in Alice in wonderland if you don't know where you're going then you're headed in the right direction um it's really it um I can really get companies I'm off on the wrong foot\nWe're speaking with Sue Shellenbarger the wall Street Journal so of course all these terms are extremely general ... you know you're making a general character characterization but are there differences between a humble woman as a Boston a humble man she held to something different\nI it it that's a difficult thing to say it varies by workplace um I don't think there are a lot of differences and expectations of\nMale and female bosses in some workplaces in others it's still true that a woman boss wouldn't be suspect if she came across as more than charismatic and authoritarian\nUm I think it just varies it it's true generally that women have tended to be more humble in the past because of their upbringing and their experience in the workplace they face obstacles that men don't\nAnd again that do humble bosses work across all industries\n[noise] good question um increasingly they do is more

to remain calm amid volatility Maria how can you keep yourself from freaking out\nSo it's obviously hard to do you know this week was\nReally crazy in the markets the Dow fell you know more than a hundred points on Wednesday so it's easy to get caught up in that but the truth is if you're a relatively young investor you should you know play the long game as history has shown and not get overly panicked about every day that the market has\nWhat the problem with constantly checking all your accounts\n[noise] the thing is you know most of us are probably not going to be getting the money out of the account that day so what you're the number that your account says can either be really exciting or really disappointing but the truth is it's probably far off from what it will be when you actually cash they account out\nI'm at is different obviously for someone that's retiring tomorrow or has another really short term goal but if you are investing for the long term you know the number that it says ten twenty Thirty years before you're ready to have your money out it's not super important\nBut Rio what's the best way to get money put into your four O. one K. or even a Roth IRA

reevaluate [noise] um you know look at the normal things with their subscription or a cell phone plan you can negotiate on and maybe bring your costs down um all of those things can have really big

um you know retail therapy can really catch up with you a lot of us are\nAlready severely in credit card debt I'm the U.S has the you know more than a trillion dollars in credit card debt so it's not a a good time to contribute more to that\nUm so you know there's plenty of free things you can do go for a walk you know go for ... even watching TV is better than going on a shopping spree so try to do pretty much anything but that\nAnd with interest rates rising this time now to pay off debt if you can\n[noise] exactly so we are going to the interest rates probably arise several times this year or so um you want to get ahead of that before your credit card is charging you even more and interests so if you can pay off as much as you can now that will really pass later\nOn the positive side of higher interest rates some banks may be paying better rates\nYes that's true so um if you're looking for a new bank account um or even if you're not you probably should just see that they're really great options out there um Goldman Sachs market has almost two percent\nOn a savings account which is huge ally bank it's another one synchrony bank they all have you know pretty good on line savings rate so if you're getting just minimum at your normal um you know if you're just thinking at chase or something like that your savings account probably doesn't get that much so look into some of these online banks and see if they can do better for you\nAnd Maria this is a great time to try to find a side gig or another job if he can swing it\nYeah we're all they're heading into the holiday season
