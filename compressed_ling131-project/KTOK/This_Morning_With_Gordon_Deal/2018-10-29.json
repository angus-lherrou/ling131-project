S. P. S. all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday that's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise]\nUm you know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat up a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious that\nThinking about is is that they're just a dropping this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often tend to do things according to the experts in so [noise]\nYou know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing [noise]\nUm but you know the good news is any package that's put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened it's suddenly all the time if the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming he's got a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seemed like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that the technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far were sent to the the mail to the post the postal service and so\nUm you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through\n'em but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know it's just the volume is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why all to mainly um you know the last and last line of defense is those you know the people in the mail room and so and the good news is the government certainly had the facilities stop these also the private and private companies are I think it will really taking a close eye on these types of packages\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a tech didn't

with a Republican [noise]\nUm so there is a bit of that but also the Republicans in the suburbs I'm voting for Barbara updates like her perform and if they can keep them in the fold and that's where the Democrats have a problem in this district\n... let me come above polling indicated that things are like\nA ... internal polling on both sides that show the statistical tie so both sides are coming and started going to come down to turn out and you see that playing out across the country where\nUm it's really about who can mobilize the voters are the most and we're seeing in polls that a

they're doing which is a little bit different is that they're using Chang but the way you're going to be able to do it is new but the growth of peer to peer ... which basically allows huge attack message people with out them ever having to opt ten\nAnd you've seen this reflection cycle that surge worked at the at least a hundred million just being sent in just a few of them I imagine it's going to be several several times that\nI'm for the ... election and one of the ... one of the main people involved in the ...\nElection they actually had the co founder of the biggest kick pick acting company on the white\n... how have they indicated how they might use Facebook differently this time because he said they're still spending money there right\nYeah actually there was among the biggest spenders even though they are up for reelection for two more years among the biggest political centers and I'm sure right now but um we had a we had a group of a data scientist at NYU\nThat have been studying this issue they went through and analyze the ads and they're not about messaging but not about the mid term even are these ads are about wanting to users to give them their cell phone numbers to give them their email addresses that where they can contact people off wind so\nIn a way they're spending all this money now so they can contact them off the top on later you know people still are as as long as people still use Facebook\nThey are probably going to spend money on it\nBut there's also a deep distrust of the club for among conservative people said that ... ... you know the concerns raised a little bit of a equal crime they don't really believe it but I can tell you some people that I talk to him but the Trump about there is a really deep suspicion that\nFacebook will not be nearly as powerful for them in twenty twenty because of it are largely cleaning workforce\nYeah we're speaking with Alex Thompson national political reporter at Politico piece was called this is how Donald Trump stays president for four more years or revisit something you said earlier about the lead time and announcing for reelection on inauguration day what what has that done for them\nIn the past presidents don't usually declare for one or declare for reelection white away because it was seen as\nA as a little a\nShame that you would look like you're going on political interests add up the country but you know and Trump's America that is not really concerned I think they said we're not going to I'm not getting the people that went up for re election this time I mean people that the Trump orbit so that those are the rules and that\nWe need to take advantage of every single second that we have\nAnd not worry about the political optics\nThings Alex Alex

hard so you visited a don't convict high school so out of Dallas in there at least they were using or is it a pre K. teacher who was based in in Georgia\n[noise] yeah I mean they they have a sixty

interesting um you know the kids you know they seem to be well adjusted to it\nAh that was my first time seeing it so I had a lot of questions but you know they everything is digital even if the kids want to raise their hand there's a button they can push the raised her hand they want to give the thumbs up they can push a button for thumbs up and they also can use a microphone ... microphone button to talk to the teacher\nWow is it that the districts like that cannot find teachers\n[noise] you know that that does shortages are in these critical teaching areas in the science math special education\nAnd you know a big issue that I hear from districts and teachers alike is it's the pay 'em you know the average starting teacher salaries about thirty nine thousand granted there's some districts that you know pay more than that starting salary but that the average\nAnd a district right now are wrestling with tight budgets they just can't come up with them just can't boost the pay that much so you know and it's a good market right now for jobs and you know these teacher these people that might have ... they have other options now\nAre so at ... high school you visited or the

opponents who have weighed in decades for a reliably\nConservative Supreme Court knocking on the buildings bronze doors but after historically partisan confirmation by the justice is made on answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard wool says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happens with abortion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways that can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding that cetera\nAnd then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts\nUm strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they um um allow them but in more cases than not they strike them down based on what they understand to be Supreme Court precedent\nTo those cases you know move along through the pipeline they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do as much as they possibly can and these cases has spot them down and say we're not going to take them or whatever that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we're going to let that stand [noise]\nSo that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nAre still the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but at any point can say now it seems like a good time and it's like well\nYeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those and the cases it takes a writer important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where\nCircuit courts those are the federal appeals\nWhich the level right below the Supreme Court\nAnd they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit courts in those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue and one or two or three circuit court ruled in another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases come into court on abortion now\nNot reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can easily say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they're directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court to simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stands report\nJust wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court and might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year\nSimply doesn't want to do anything it might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today's Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well please\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another\nLet's say because it's often the case that anti abortion plaintiffs those bringing the case\nI Want to go to the Supreme Court and say hey you know we want to ... uh but uh twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw\nAbortions that are undertaken cuts of particular regions like the sex or or or the disability if the fetus\nThe court the Supreme Court only gets involved and says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting because it basically has to because the lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court you don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts\nAnd that doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took\nA on this subject to the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know harassing\nPeople outside clinics or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth abortion and then in two thousand and six team just a couple of years ago it had to do with the Texas law that was restricting clinics restricting providers", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This
