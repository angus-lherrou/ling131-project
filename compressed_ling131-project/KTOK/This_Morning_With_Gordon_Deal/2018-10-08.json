fell in September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at ... dot com mark what's that number mean\nIt means that there's nothing to the air and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country for Eighteen straight months Gordon the nation's unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected a and a sense adjusted\nAbout project it back then that four and a half percent was essentially for employment and our country and we've been below that level for uh Eighteen months so uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strains from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers ah but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the hoping to get more pay standpoint\nAverage hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there and so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and it's not the case\nAnd speak with more cameras senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the\nSeptember jobs report um\nDoes the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously\nYeah ah well for one a lot of average right so that the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a full informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well\nWith it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector you're working so I'm\nTo the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked by people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left [laughter] I think\nThe best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh\nThe but you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend in other words does it mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years or does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and all that so the answer that only comes after the fact\nBut I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impact of the tax cut begin to fade and twenty twenty\nI think probably twenty twenty as a date to watch when that happens to coincide ironically or perhaps not what the

President Obama's to those Nate campaign but the question for Mr O'Rourke it protects us Democrats is that\nHis appeal is strongest with young people and Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that\nAre as we know from twenty sixteen and past election tend not to show up in numbers proportionate to their share of the population really admit trouble elections when turnout a goes away down compared to presidential years uh and so uh the ... campaign and then Texas Democrats think that\nUh they will have a surgeon voter turnout or like what President Obama did and to have made or similarly to like what President Trump did with white working class voters or non college educated voters and twenty sixteen but there's not\nSo far a lot of evidence already hard data to show that that is going to be the case\nAnd there was the interesting a data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas just panics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nThey tend to be a little more Republican than a fax around the country I think in twenty sixteen it was a thirty four percent of Tetris Hispanics for the Republican compared to twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts in Texas are are fairly gerrymandered too many Democrats as possible and then they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress but the can down the ballot for for local races or you know and so that the general elections have been a cakewalk short one party or the other\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no add add onto that there really hasn't been a competitive\nStatewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh and so there's not a political machinery to get folks out to vote or the ... campaign has had to build that on the fly over the course of the last year and a half\nA and whether there'll be able to do it in time for November six of the big question\nFor speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein is written a piece titled Beto O'Rourke draws big crowds in Texas but he's voters tend not to vote the reluctance to vote is a presumption that a Democrat can win like what we're what does that come from\nWell just no I mean if you ask a Mr O'Rourke he'll tell you that nobody's going to ask but I Know and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having to do all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the ... the big state uh and some of these counties are very small uh some of the counties that\n... that I was a bit in Texas twice this year to visit him a C is campaigning in February when I was down there he was visiting counties a inch having more people show up to his to see him then voted in the twenty sixteen election in those counties\nA and so he thinks that he's able to draw\nA people out who haven't participated before because there's been a little reason for them to court because Texas has been so Republican uh one of the things he says on the campaign trail that he doesn't believe that Texas has a red state but it's a non voting state or you can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is a ... house district in El Paso or haven't voted much either so there's not while he is certainly been very compelling on the campaign trail has drawn enormous numbers of people\nUh the evidence that he can get that the show up at the polls or\nAt least is not grounded in in his own history uh his his house district is

[noise]\nAnd uh [noise] from what I gather it was about Fifteen minutes wrong and President Trump spoke for the vast majority of those Fifteen minutes and you know the phone call was described to me I could just picture has voice right you know\nTalking about how beautiful how excellent things are going to be now things are going to be different now uh you know don't worry about everything's amazing that passes fast things are good\nAnd you know and you see the way he's he's a he's talking to you publicly um something people haven't really picked up on is he's now talking about how our continent as being ripped off [noise]\nAlso I look at some of the behind the scenes frustrations a leading up to the moment where there was a deal\nI Know you mentioned as kind of one of the items on the potential to do is we'll be regulatory streamlining anything I'd jump out as one of the guys use\nYeah I'll give an example so the for years now the governments are um I've been working on this thing called the regulatory Cooperation Council\nAnd the idea is as follows I'll give you one specific example of how I understand it\nSo the different countries have different rules for Britain products to market which is normal every country has its own sovereign right or the regular stuff but sometimes those differences are so tiny and so insignificant but they cause big problems right so let's stick to lipstick cost something like eight hundred bucks to bring to market in the United states\nAnd Canada it costs I forgot what it was it was like a fifty hundred two hundred thousand dollars I don't I don't remember the exact I'll be honest but\nIt's a lot of money and the reason it cost that much it's going to Canada a lipstick with that yes like some some protection as classified as a pharmaceutical oh ... yeah exactly and so there's a whole bunch of different stuff like this and the system so the question is can we find a way\nTo remove duplication of record of regulations that don't really matter that are insignificant and then you get rid of those regulations and you just allow it make it easier for companies to sell things a back and forth across the border\nUh the thing it's been kind of you know that that whole thing starts in stops all over the years hasn't really done much for the last couple of years because there was a new government Canada and your ... in the U.S [noise] so the idea is you know without a conference this fall to try to jumpstart the process and get you know businesses rain gauge the dominant channel what can we do to change\nRegulations that are basically costing our economy money ... ...\n... we're speaking with Alex Panetta from political he's the editor of political pro Canada has written a piece and settled behind the scenes with Trump and Trudeau\nHow they made nice uh you represent a couple of times too like digs in public speeches at each other across the border could that actually hamper things or is that something that's starting to\nTone down now how do you see it\nWell [noise] okay so here's the thing I think that President Trump deserves a lot of credit for some of the things she got an agreement you got things that frankly a rock Obama would have liked but at what cost right because what you've done is essentially you know publicly beat up on a smaller country next door\nA to gain these little things and in the meantime so the President Trump's approval rating of St Paul's that put it as low as ... percent getter\nWhen you when you're ... eleven percent ... there's not a lot you can do with another country and the other countries going to be happy to do with the right you can't really ask for any favors\nAnd so you know take this compound it around the world so the steel tariffs you know using this this big stick to try to get changes it might work it really might work but on the other hand it might also in second eyes every single country in the world and make you make them less likely to help you or do things with you a going forward [noise]\nSo that's the ... right to show the you know Obama's approach to attract specific partnership for instance was using the carrot\nTry to gently bring countries along to the U.

health law polling indicates that no issue is more important to voters than health care and Wall Street journal reporter Stephanie Armour says this internal tension carries risk Stephanie what are we seeing\nWell actually what you've seen is as the mid term elections get closer and closer in November the Medicare for all is an idea has really taken off far more than even the supporters of it expected like they were they taught us that something more for the twenty twenty\nPresidential elections and it's kind of emblematic of the struggle going on right now within the Democratic party be you have sort of the more liberal side is wanting to do more aggressive policies such as Medicare for all and then you have some of the more centrist Democrats crash especially in conservative\nStates that are like whoa if we do this we could\nAlienate some of our more kind of a centrist democratic voters so that's really the the the battle and the debate that's playing out right now\nBoy who supports this ah well I'm ... this is obviously the idea was first I'm kind of brought forward by Bernie Sanders and his idea of a really it to the Medicare for all that is that single payer\nHas now at this point uh garnered um sixteen or actually Fifteen correspond church because Al Franken longer on there and um there's now a Medicare for all ... in the\nHouse you're seeing a lot of um sort of the more younger newer faces who are challenging incumbents ... and also in in a lot more of the liberal states uh you're seeing that you know become a real talking point in Minnesota I'm with dean fill up\nAnd then on the Democratic side as well who is saying well all we need to go easy here\nI think you see 'em a individuals like men for example who ran who didn't fully come out in support of Medicare for all you see people like I'm In West Virginia\nWho are the a mansion who is um you know taking a much more cautious approach easy on a number of candidates who are saying look what we really need to do is fix the Affordable CARE Act and build on that versus kind of throwing out I'm the baby with the bath water\nAnd speak with Wall Street journal healthcare policy reporter Stephanie Armour or ... some Democrats want Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way those the slogan it still play Medicare in rural versus say the phrase single payer system\nYeah that that's a good question when you when the polls go out and ask people voters about Medicare for all the support is strikingly high around Seventy percent\nBut yeah the Medicare for all that\nHas gotten the most interests that brings Sanders plant in the form of single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think of single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I Do think some of this is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all isn't even among the Democrats\nThere's been a widening support for more watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare is one of the options even though they're technically not I'm old enough\nSo that kind of where I think that what was going to hit the road as this goes forward as Democrats are going to have to come to some kind of consensus on what they mean what they want and as we saw with Republicans and their efforts to repeal and replace the AC a that's not an easy task\nIs there a perception among those who support Medicare for all that the government is good at running programs\nI don't know that they would go so far as to say good at running program that I think they they are building on the popularity of Medicare itself which has high\nApproval rating summits beneficiaries and ... has a positive connotation in the public and I also think they that they see this as a way to expand health care coverage to everyone I'm as well as a way to ah\nAh lord us health care spending which I Would say the the critics of it being mentally disagree with\nMedical groups would rally against it I presume because there'd be less money for them\n[noise] yeah there is that the federal government generally in almost all cases pays a lower reimbursement rate for care\nAnd um private payer such as insurance companies do their concern obviously about lower reimbursement but also they're looking at it as okay let's see you overhaul the complete healthcare system they're saying that this is going to be what were the last my coming into hospitals which tend will cause massive job losses in the industry", "show_name": "This Morning
