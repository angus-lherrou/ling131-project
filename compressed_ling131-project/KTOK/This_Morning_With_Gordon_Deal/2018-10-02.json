many scientists say it's great that people are trying to clean up the patch others say most of our efforts should instead go towards stopping the out of control flow of plastic garbage into the ocean it's a story by ... rice science writer at USA Today toil tell us about the patch\nIt's about like the solid mass it's about like\nEh it's not like a thing you can necessarily see from an airplane or from space because a lot of it is just under the surface and it's also a lot of little a lot of it is broken down into rather small pieces so\nWhen you think of it it's not like you can't walk on edge

currents play a role in sort of keeping it all together is in weather patterns things like that\nIt's mainly ocean currents that's the main thing that keeps the thing's going or a ... they're called jai ours is just the scientific term and that's just a kind of a circular pattern swirling around the ocean and it it eventually it's kinda like in the bath tub it circles around and around there all the stuff kind of collects in one area\nAnd that's what's happened here that that it's a a ... that's kind of goes around much of that part of the Pacific just ends up circling together and did this one mass and as I said there's other jai hours in the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic ocean and ah so this is this is one of several around the world around\nWho's responsible for ... for all this mess\nAnd yeah it's all humans it's a you know there was obviously no plastic before the fifties the Nineteen fifties and so basically it's just a uh it's just all of us around the world I'm In dumping plastic not disposing of properly\nAllowing it to just flow out into the ocean I'm this particular patch um it's probably mainly from Asia uh they they they they seem to think that most of the ocean trash is from China\nIndonesia the Philippines a and that's that's kind of been the source for a lot of it the U.S is is somewhat of a contributor I it's not we're not completely blameless but we are overall doing a better job than some of the some of the developing countries around the world so\nThat that is that wind up in there if if if let's say that China is to blame for a good chunk of this are they actually dumping it in the ocean or they can't process what they have were being sense\nWell yea for quite a while they were happily accepting garbage or plastic garbage from around the world you know ... other countries didn't know what to do with it and so we are other countries would ship it to China and that that was something that was well no we was ship them our garbage and our plastic\nAnd for whatever reason we didn't no one really seemed to you know see no evil well you know once we ship it there we didn't really know what they did with it well you know could very well be they were just dumping into the ocean\nAh we we don't know 'cause we we don't really ... track that but they have actually China has stopped accepting trash from other parts of the world as over the last couple of years so that that will no longer be a a dumping ground for this plastic\nUh so where where other countries are going to have to figure out what to do with it a rather than just dumping it a China\nWe're speaking with soil rice science reporter at USA Today has ... where did the trash in the great Pacific garbage patch come from and how do we stop it you quoted somebody in the stories that\nAre ... there were these wonderful cleanup efforts going on but that's a waste of time largely we need to spend more time figuring out how to keep this up out of the ocean\nWhat just mentioning that are either this is a pig to the\nTo the ocean cleanup project which is a very noble and nobody's saying you know necessarily that it's not a good thing but uh that uh it's this project developed by a another one's company a very young guy started about a few years ago he was Eighteen at the time\nAnd it's the ocean cleanup project and he's invented this a\nKind of this large scooping mechanism that he and some of his colleagues there believe will uh\nWill actually be able to soak up for school up a lot of this trash and the ocean if it's successful we'll go out and uh you
