mid term elections is not going to be as powerful as once believed that dead history does not favor the political party of the president during off year elections\nWith a look at three build whether states that could determine control of the Senate ears Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side Jerry set this up\nWell so for Democrats to win a control the Senate and that the Republicans have only\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep a seats and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm\nA lot of the seats Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there and find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um equation that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bell weather states that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle to Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a ... there's a liberal base progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to cap and I'll want her to oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and\nIf she holds on it'll be because uh she Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the balance to be deeply important for the Democrats second one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Democrat and other democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights very very uh a heavily funded from both sides\nAnd the wild card there all of a sudden is hurricane Michael and does that help Governor Scott because he's seen as a leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him if people think the rescue effort hasn't been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need hold on to that one if they're going to have a chance they answered is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring ... Arizona is kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way in any election\nUh and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha mix Sally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the\nDemocratic side in a year of the woman going at it a low Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnd Kirsten Sinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if\nDemocrats are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote total was probably going to have for years on him so those seemed like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November ...\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury ... an online video talking about the three\nBellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida the kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like a Kavanaugh in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\nThat that's a great question I it's hard to know is this I'm either going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voters suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities those are two groups of voters who simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in the mid term election compared to their performance in a presidential election so\nThey're you know events on the ground are difficult to predict but it's also difficult to predict turnout in the mid term there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm on both sides but you know it's easy as in three weeks before the election actually showing up on election day or two different things\nWhen is Jerry it's Wall Street journal executive

the Democrats stand a good chance of taking the house in the mid term elections what happens if Adam Schiff\nBecomes chairman of house intelligence Elijah Cummings takes oversight and Gerald Nadler Helms the house Judiciary Committee here's Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard Eric what's up here\nRight now we've got a whole crush of people being called before congressional committees to testify about the FBI indio Jay's actions before the two thousand ... election\nMajor investigation that have been going on for a while but now all of a sudden there's a time pressure on getting people to come in and testify\nBefore those committees and it all comes down to the mid term elections which is there's an expectation that probably you know Republicans have a three out of for a chance to lose this should be ah the house\nMajority sheer and what they lose if they lose a majority of the crucial thing an investigation is it's up to the chairman of the house committee\nThe issue subpoenas sort of on his or her own show and show you you meet the subpoena power to force people to come in and talk\nTo give testimony and in the Senate the chairman of a Senate committee need the agreement of the ranking member of the other party to issue subpoenas so you don't have the same kind of power and so even if the Republicans hold on to the\nSenate if they lose their house they really lose that power to force people to come in to testify\nWhile still the current let's say investigations could they be shut down if Democrats take control or or the do the investigation tough to see the way to the end\nOf the congressional investigations can turn on a dime I mean\nThey can be going along and be one day from coming out with their report conclusions and if the party changes and the power over what the majority puts out as a chore court changes immediately and show\n'em power of having congressional hum leadership both in the big picture and in each individual committee I'm really determines what that committee does it's like\nWith the inspector general's investigation which is going on he will keep going with his investigation regardless of who's in power and conquest\nI'm speaking with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard he's written a piece titled how the midterms will affect Congress's investigations are what are the Democrats in the house said they'll probe if they gained the majority after November\nWell you know you've got in the house intelligence committee instead of Devin Nunes has you'll have it being run by Adam Schiff and he's made it very clear that he will be\nI'm pursuing allegations of money laundering from the Trump Organization so that's what his focus will be and you'll have over in the house oversight committee I'm Alive shortcomings will be in charge there\nAnd a Jerrold Nadler will take over the house Judiciary Committee those are the three committees that have been primarily looking at a investigations a shift has made it clear\nThat um is money laundering investigation that he wants to launch we'll be focused specifically on Donald Trump and Russia so you can be pretty sure that on the house side that any investigation into abuses by the FBI or the\nApartment of justice I'm with regard to investigating the Trump campaign during the two thousand sixteen election um those will disappear from the house side\nWould have Republicans hold the house then what happens [noise]\nUm then things keep going on and what will happen is the investigations I think will not only\nHave kind of new life but they'll have a a new energy that will come from having been racing to get 'em witnesses before the committee's [laughter] you know the things had been moving along\nAt a store to steady pace with everything else going on in the house and so all of a sudden they have a lot more time at their disposal but they've done a bunch of\n'em race to the finish interviews that'll put them in a position to really step up their investigations dramatically\nExert Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard\n... has brought through my Brooklyn\nBrooklyn in sheets name the winner of the best of

nearly one hundred and fifty students who range in age from six to Twenty one Wall Street journal education reporter Leslie Brody paid a visit Leslie What did you see\nEvery school in New Jersey has to have a one fire drill and when security Joe a month\nA including locked ends and evacuations just as a you know as a precaution I and\nI hadn't really thought about how hard that would be to fulfill for some of the schools that serve some of the most disabled children and that so I watched an evacuation jail at one of the schools it's called the Phoenix center and not leave which is just west of New York city\nAnd this was interested to see how hard the staff work to keep the students come and get them out of the building\nYou know school shootings you know they're obviously way too many of them but they're still\nRare I mean it is unlikely that this school will be a target it but it's a state law to practice and so they do and they take it very seriously and um [noise] you know it's it's it's a lot of work when you have students who have severe autism Down syndrome or their behavioral challenges some of them or\nA seizure disorders or medical issues and um they they work hard to to to do what they need to do\nA lot of these students have one on one eight so when the when the alarm sound the AIDS in each goes to his or her student and they walk out together or some of them\nIn the oxygen tanks or I'm sort of items that calmed them down like blankets or figured spinners\nSome of them have these things called social story which are like um [noise]\nLike flash cards with visual symbol and stuff you know a flame or um you know people lining up outside of a door to help uh students don't understand really what's going on to a to sort of get the instructions\nSo fascinating story by the wall Street Journal luckily Brody she writes about education her piece is called an era of school shootings the most vulnerable students most prepped for the worst how would a first responders\nHelp out given some of the disability or fears like overwhelming fears of some of these students may have\n[noise] well I I think that the school has a relationship with the police department in town and so that you know police officers know while you know the kind of students that attend\nA digital that I didn't have first responders there but um you know with such a high staff to student ratio I I think that the\nUh you know the staff would be largely in charge of the students in the first responders I imagine would be instructing the staff but I I that's a good question and some of these students are are very I'm\nTerrified by noises and they're they're really crave consistency so something like a trail that gets them outside of what they're used to can be hard for some of them yet\nTo that point I I think you mentioned there was one student who sort of froze when he got to a doorway and didn't necessarily want to go outside of that time\nRight and some of the male staffer I Swear I used to him doing that it's it's happened before so they very quickly kind of came over to him and scoop their arms under his arm and kind of lifted him up a little bit to get his feet to start going again and helped him get to the evacuation say\nAnother girl who are really hates the noise she's about Fifteen she began to cry and kind of hit or south in the back of the neck her age knew exactly what calmed down which was having her\nHead rubbed in a certain way some of these teachers and AIDS and other students\nNeed so specifically that they know what comes to town [laughter] so the flare ups I thought were pretty quickly address but it was interesting when the same thing happened on the when they would the drill with over and they were heading back to\nThe school the Eighteen year old who budged on the front steps before that you know getting to the evacuation said he did the same thing on the return trip\nUm and that the teachers knew what to do\nWith
