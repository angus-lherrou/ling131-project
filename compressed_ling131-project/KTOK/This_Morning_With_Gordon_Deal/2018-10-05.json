judge Kavanaugh could rally apathetic Republican voters especially in the red states that will decide which party controls the Senate Jim explain\nWe do go to Kevin us poll numbers nationwide or are not all that impressive and there are a lot of people who believe is accuser over him in the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are\nThis year there's a little bit of a different factors are Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nA in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads races were pretty close\nAnd Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters\nWho believe the Supreme Court nominee who's been treated unfairly\nThey believe that the media has not covered him in partially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling underway and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand what really happened thirty six years ago so\nThat has at least for the time being been a little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their desire to turn out to vote in November which had been in question and a lot of\nPrevious polling that Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans are Republicans in a lot of cases seemed to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nRight so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on ...\nA big one is we've seen in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp of two remaining undecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Brett Kavanaugh hurt Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her in the last two polls that have been conducted\nWho are now in the upper single digits in terms of his lead in the polling averages a you know that was a race it's been close it's been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot\nAt taking I kept down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely\nTo vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen I think we've seen also ah the school has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill declared fairly early that she was going to vote against capital she didn't vote for Neil Gorsuch\nJosh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general the state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue on the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls that still there was a recent CNN poll that did have a three\nBut in the polling averages he's clinging to have a very narrowly it and this could be a a race for influence but by the Supreme Court matter\nNo we're speaking with Jim mental politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boost Republicans\nIn red states this probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with the Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\nDo definitely I I you know it's always a very political process so it's become much more so in recent years says each party has began to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance on the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections\nWere Democrats are already pretty energized because they just like President Trump they dislike what Republicans are doing a Washington seems to them uh like another power grab by narrow Republican majority is at a at a president that was the popular vote\nFor Republicans I mean a major factor in why they voted for Trump to the first place was we wanted conservative judges cared about who was controlling the Supreme Court they didn't want Antonin Scalia's seat in particular to go to a liberal to have Anthony Kennedy seat go to a more reliable conservative potentially\nA really does deliver a pretty big promise to many of the voters who turned out for Trump and twenty sixteen so this could be a real motivating factor for them to show up in the mid term elections so it really is something that energizes both sides to a certain
