helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr do this or loss\nPsychiatrists and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly empathic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own bodies and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre sensitive and so let me but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAn accident and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted or anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and center yourself and realize\nThat you're not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting it's and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the compassion neurons in the brain where I'm now a path to that's why it's such a\nAn interest in the ... standing impact and thought that the mirror neurons compassion neurons go on overdrive and when\nYou know for instance if someone is on a C. T. scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle here on mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\n[noise] so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all night and pat patients has to take notice fast you know not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant onslaught of stress negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature\nMedicate exercise ... friend and laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice past traumas a\nTrigger it for instance you know if you lost your father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know that different than I could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with is an addition to the current\nSituation [noise] um and also\nDoing a lot to sell nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news now be able to meditate go outside\nUm learned you know is a complete sentence with paper because then they don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no\nYou know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the types of energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make all of this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in a news [laughter] you don't want to be around\nEnergy vampires will I write about her destroying your energy\nFor we're speaking with Dr Judah oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed [noise] um can the impasse who take on all this stress from other people's tragedy call\nThemselves long term harm\n[noise] oh definitely and and the house who don't have the skills that I'm writing about in the book can be kind of course they never want to go outside\nThey had panic disorders they can add to this is a lot of the nation is because there are sensory overload all the time\nFor it they're just being bombarded and don't know how to stop it and so yeah I Believe the empathy is a trait that is going to save the world I really do I feel so strongly about it it's something I teach all my patients how to develop\nUm and you have to be living to be able to be with somebody despite their differences and try and understand where they're coming from the first step to hearing his he so we need to have empathy but we don't need to take on the suffering of the world\nExtra spending time with a smoker the Tuesday if you're thinking about contributing

felt the impact\nOf the Kavanaugh debates Wall Street journal reporter chip cutter has been sampling workplaces ... says the stew of politics and gender surrounding the new Supreme Court justice have made this moment notably personal ship would have you found\nPolitics have really spilled over into the workplace and so we heard a lot of different examples of people saying for example\nUh that that they weren't really kind of tense conversations with some of their colleagues we have examples in this piece of the people going to their bosses confided in them about really personal experiences of sexual assault\nUm one CEO how to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the political debates we're getting too heated so of a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something that really couldn't be avoided at work\nGoodness I I mean it did it cause enough friction where somebody might want to quit or they're pushing and shoving or yelling\n[noise] well we heard a talk to one person for example she works at a a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had to her tone as a group of men in front of her work walking into work and trying to kind of\nReally get into this and she felt she just did not want to engage so I think some people had to try to were suddenly redirect the conversations their tongue not engage because they just knew that they didn't want to have a heated conversation at work that\nThat that's almost like Thanksgiving dinner right you you at work avoid religion politics things like that\nFor a long time this is politics have stay out of work for a number of people told us that they don't but it's it's no wonder ... that\nYou you do bring that sells to the office that the issues that you're you're discussing outside of work of course we're going to become a into the workplace and one person I spoke with made a point that we don't we don't have a third place for these discussions anymore\nThat there is home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time so of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is this the company is called the Bateman group a naval officers in New York and San Francisco and partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefit to the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker him they had had had to set up for the past year but the flack room was called a hash tag resistance and it was a police for workers there\nTo really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people wanted to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room and if it didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates on what was happening and this was a good form for them and do it out\nThat while we're speaking with chip cutter Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place\nCan imagine to some managers are no may not be worse than having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nThat's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said he's had to tell his his small team that there really is just no place for political bickering network\nHe's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he could take care of him he's the one who paid your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that um I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens is we can determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then go from there\nHow much of this boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are some ... is our gender issues that but I think but we we heard on\nOn all sides of this that they were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think and then we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they did not feel that a judge Kaplan I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really\nCross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out at work where we spend so much more time\nAnd he's chip Wall Street journal reporter chip cutter it's twenty minutes now in
