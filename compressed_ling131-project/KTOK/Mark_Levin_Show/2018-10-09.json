that we can't cut back a dime of spending there'll be some constituent groups where in the city where they pay lobbyists those constituent group does not exist in the concentrated force it does in

I'm Sorry but that ain't us\nFolks I was never a Democrat ever\nBut growing up you know in in in New York City in Queens\n\nYou know you have this tendency to kind of you know want to understand how liberal see the world again I was never a liberal I'm a I was an independent most of my life but what really opened me up to conservatism was that this saying us moment\n\nAnd then they say and I was a moment for me it was when I was a police officer in New York City\nAnd I saw how again I'm not suggesting every single time a cop access to you know there are a listener unfortunately are bad cop cigarettes I'm telling you the overwhelming majority overwhelming I worked with were great guys and women who really just gave them they weren't there to get rich trust me there ain't no money in policing and he and his word in that case\n\nBut when I was a cop and I was an independent you know again sometimes sometimes that even kind of see it the liberal way from being surrounded all the time by Democrats\n\nI remember how some cops in use of force incidents who I Know did nothing wrong they acted according to how they were almost viciously in immediately attacked by the media activists out there without even giving them a fair shake I'm telling you that was my that in a moment\nWhy said something's wrong here this is this isn't right I mean if you can just attack someone a police officer without even hearing your story in an unquestionably tragic incident that will use of force incidents are no one goes out in the street with the desire to get to use of force incidents sorry do you think that's what cops do your seriously seek professional help\nBut to see the way they were treated that was my they're saying a moment I'm telling you Democrats I'm telling you\nThat they're saying a moment is happening almost daily now with you guys and ladies screaming and raving lunatics attacking people I have montage as I put together on my show of liberals losing their minds\nYou who who exactly do you think this appeals to you are turning off generations of Americans just like you did back in the Nineteen sixty\nEight election as Dan Horowitz again puts in his wonderful piece in conservative review today\nI Know Nixon fan believe me Nixon was a Nixon was more of a Democrat and he was a Republican and he was an awful president I'm Sorry but the Nixon campaign team understood that late Nineteen sixties election that\nChaos doesn't sell folks chaos is not a brand chaos chaos\nWhy the liberals think that instilling a sense of of chaos and insecurity

[noise] yes yes\nWelcome back to the market then show Dan budget you know as the bonds you know on Twitter in for the great one so I'm Talking about the lessons learned\nFrom the cabinet when dropping the big at all on the left or you just had as a formal swearing in ceremony although he's already been sworn in at the White House came into thunderous applause gosh winning feels good and I've been\nGiven you the lessons learned from this we're up to rule number are are lesson learned I should say keep say in rural less because I'm so used to say an old rules new rules that's kinda my thing for those you know me from my show [laughter]\nBut this this lesson learned lesson learned number six Democrats are now trashing you or judicial supremacy again had to Dan Horowitz has a great piece on this a conservative review today\nFolks this is not a bad thing\nNow all of a sudden the Democrats that they have lost their bid to take over the majority on the Supreme Court\nThey thought they'd have a six three majority where the president Hillary Clinton right ... ... and quite work out that way\nNow than it is a five for conservative majority and the swing vote is now John Roberts rather than Anthony Kennedy who is a I Believe more reliable conservative vote I Hope in the future\n[noise] the liberals are now attacking the courts now listen attacking an institution in the United states because you lost is not a good thing but hard which makes a really good point here folks liberals for years\nHave had a really hard time doing one thing they can't seem to get a national mandate for any of their hard left proposals to pass through think about it\nNow I'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had they've had the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand to pretend that didn't happen\nBut the big ticket items that liberals on abortion on demand Bob yeah a basic income\nMedicare for all these are big ticket big monstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberals they have no national mandate for\nThey wanted a national mandate for gay marriage wherever you stand on it they couldn't get it states were knocking it down they were putting it on referendum they were losing\n[noise]\nLiberals as a backstop have always relied on the courts and legislators in black robes who pretend to be judges to pass those items why it's very simple when you think about it it is a very simple mathematical equation do you want to have to convince a hundred million Americans in\nA presidential election to vote for your candidate along with your house of representative members and your Senate members or do you want to convince one or two judges and a black robe consider themselves swing voters to do it for\nYou the answer is obvious they have always relied on the courts because the fees and you're just get a bunch\nOf liberals pretending to be judges on the court you choose to legislate from the bench and you don't have to do the hard work\nOf knocking on doors getting elected in telling people why you think government controlling their health care when they can't even run the damn the Ovie at a DMV excuse me or whatever the deal is they can't run that either they convincing them that that's good\nFor them you can't there is no popular mandate for it so now that that avenue to the Supreme Court has been cut off for them\nThey're starting to now I Want you to screen shot all of their tweets when you're out there on Twitter them saying the Supreme Court it's not legitimate screen shot all of this\nBecause there may unfortunately become a time when they take back the majority on the Supreme Court and I want you to fire all those screen shots back\nAt them on Twitter hey look at this remember when you said judicial supremacy and the Supreme Court that matter\nThat what's that going to matter you're not going to change your mind these people don't stand for anything so I just actual principles are principles power they worship the golden calf of government that is what they do their national pastime is genuine flexing before the author of big government at whatever means they have to use the get there doesn't matter\nBut another lesson learned from this is if the Democrats are going to attack judicial supremacy we as Republicans should say is only to make this personal the courts do have a constitutional role but you know what labs you don't think the court should be deciding thanks [noise]\nYes welcome to the party piles Bruce Willis ed diehard\nCalmer than be why obey\nBring it\nYou're welcome we don't believe that either\nBelieve in a constitutional republic to do the hard work of legislating you have to elect representatives and a representative democracy\nThat are going to go vote for our values the fact that you can't do that live sounds a whole lot like your problem not ours\nWe haven't had any problem getting tax cuts passed through because we believe in

problems but I Know our problem is the Democrats right\nIf the more we get elected we can afford to lose a few rhinos and still hold the conservative majority of the problem with this slim lead we have now in the Senate is we have to collectively kiss kiss the butts of unreliable people\nAnd we can't do that in the Senate we have to be able to let a few rhinos go and still hold on to the concert a great call Jim uh\nUnfortunately I got to take a break 'em run up against time but folks as important as a pivotal election get out and vote bring ten friends again it's not always a choice

Bush or a Republican President George W. Bush at the time when Joe Biden gave the speech to nominate someone in in the year of a presidential election\nBecause they felt that the public should vote on the president and the president should be able to pick someone they feel like\nThey weren't we was when he feels good [noise] but I say that because they're coming back there not finished healthy for a second they're going to take any of his life out of\nTheir budget you know as the bunch you know on Twitter mark a seven seven three it wants to limit you when\nA X. Y. F. M. Ninety six boys want\n... to the a team player I lease Sarah Fox news the ceremonial swearing in for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh at the White House despite\nThe Spygate disaster is really three sub scandals right\nIf the information superhighway I'll get to that\nIt's this spying scandal the coordinated effort to actually use intelligence assets to spy on a political campaign\n\nAnd it's the set up there actually three sub scandals in this entire debacle this collusion fabrication the part I'm referencing now new NASA Maria barter Romo show is the information superhighway\nThat's what I call\nThe information superhighway was an effort\nBy Democrat Party operatives\nThey're paid contractors whether they be law firms are opposition researchers was an effort by them to shuttle negative information about Trump and his team information most of it that turned out later on to be completely false\nIt was the effort to get that information into the bloodstream of the department of justice and the FBI\nThrough ivy while bypassing them out\nThey weren't going to feed it to him because then it would have to go through the GI track that if it was poisoned the stomach as ways of dealing with that they wanted this main line right into the bloodstream\n\nThey needed to bypass all of those body protections that the D. O. J. and the FBI half\nThe vetting of information the woods procedure where they've had information through multiple channels the vetting of sources the ah you know credibility checks or listen you're telling us to stop but this is a political opponent of yours like this is political apple research right they wanted to bypass all of that the information superhighway was a way to do this\nThe way to do was to go right to the top of the FBI and not to the field office guys the guys actually doing the hard work investigating the kidnappings across state lines that bank robberies\nThe terrorism cases they didn't bring their information to them they brought their information to the top level guys the suits who they knew where politicians before they were cops and they bypass all of those legal protections\nThey did it into the FBI to what noon yes revealed this weekend by shuttling this up to a lawyer right into the top levels of the FBI\nHow did they do it and the the OJ the information superhighway it was obvious that the OJ\nThey mainline their right to Bruce or what was the number four official into the OJ but was actually meeting with Christopher Steele who was paid to do this what what's known as revealed this weekend was a pivotal key piece of information\nAbout what makes this even more devastating and more profound 'cause I get it I totally understand\nWhere the lives are going to go with this for water a guy had information or people pass informational ... no no no that's not the way that works\nThey'll typically pass it to a field office that will investigate the vet the information they'll go into a court of law there'll be a grand jury at some point there will be some adversarial hearing either at some initial appearance later on or a trial\nThat's not what they did they walked into a fight as a court where there was no ability for the Trump deep to defend themselves at all they brought information that was paid for by the Democrats and and and the real kicker here\n\nThe bureau lied about it\nJim Comey and others insisted\nThat they didn't know where a lot of this information was coming from they didn't understand the political origins of\nLadies and gentleman that is clearly a lie a fabrication at this point that is clearly made up they were meeting with the lawyer who is being paid by the DNC\nIt was a fabrication it was made up\nIt was nonsense why with the bureau lie about it these upper level managers if they had nothing to hide this is I I mean this answer this question answers itself\n\nThe information superhighway it was an effort to bypass all of these protections folks\nThis cases discuss than it is a grotesque abuse of power when all the information comes out you're going to look at this you're going to read this I have this stuff in my book and you're going to sit there and say to yourself how the heck did this happen in the United states of America\nThe key now is to not let it happen again\nAnd I got more and this and the other side of the break a seven seven three one three one more if you want to give us a call like seven seven three one two three and one one I'm damn bunch you know in from work within we'll be right back [noise] month\n...\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead forth\nThe word fourth raises another question which way

didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them after my got the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat in the status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says no use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here after my kept finding on Nathaniel ... by half until the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands to resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hardworking Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolve over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the IRS call my friends that optimal tax relief\nEight hundred for nine nine sixty three

already ordered and then the child it back a bit\nFolks I don't have an easy answer for it or for that question for you I just know the information is going to be absolutely devastating [noise] um I Know that because the Democrats are not calling for the de classification of the Pfizer and when the Democrats are trying to hide something you typically means it's going to expose the entire scandal and again having put\nTwo years of research into this book a nice take that back when he wants to two years wasn't two years about a year\nOf research into this book\nI'm pretty sure it's going to get ugly really fast and I think what it's going to expose that information superhighway I told you about the by passing of traditional channels to get information to the upper levels of the FBI where people with political connections would act politically and not in a law enforcement matter that is ultimately the big scandal here [noise]\nNow I told you would get I had a few conservative callers
