{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "You know listen there's this tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well on to these types of of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money in taxes\nOf course they're gonna do well under a tax cuts that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they have been a hawk and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of and by by a pre existing narrative in trying to advance she re frames it\nIn his way perfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is\nThis is a a this is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people who are weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost total logical Trump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames Lesley Stahl who's smart\nShe's listening she's not them she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically senses Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop them she cuts them off by the way she interviewed them I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times but we figured that because that's what they do right\n[noise] she get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the way basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it\nHe doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all that's Trump's ammo he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paints this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nTo benefit of getting the last word in is Utah class then that's what everybody remembers\nSalt tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this or when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going\nAnd then he says at the end and you know Leslie and and that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what\nI think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of\nAgain a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversation sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... of a kind of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits it hits hard\nAnd people are attracted to that authenticity\n\nSo he understands he has to reframe it number one and secondly\nHe understands fully that he needs to get that last word in any did and that's what everybody remembered\nBecause I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but the show you how that performance contrast with what's going on in the Democrat Party right now which is a just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic who they are\nThey based their entire campaigns around identity politics and class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren that I\n...

literally was one of the great projects in my life I really enjoyed it [noise]\nBut there's been a break in the case or we'll break in the case over the weekend I should say break a revelation to break in the case up in a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe has been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice in at the upper level management the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks are here's what happened this week it let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nAre seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been on Mars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and it's like that Bruce Willis movie or what was that with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone [laughter]\nThe Donald Trump people's spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nMy book as extensive footnotes audit even by I use liberal footnotes did that way to liberals camera phew what they said in the past on it but\nThe cases very simple in its essence ... opposition political parties from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases the law enforcement community in case of the FBI the upper level so they're management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it now why am I bring that up now not to give you like oh what's great what\nElse is there are lots to talk about them I'm bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe unleashed they just the port of information and Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that at Arizona on the weekends and he said that there is some potentially exculpatory\nMaterial hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going not remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history against a suit to be president Donald Trump at a time a presidential candidate\nThe explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seemed to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole was all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha bank that's in my book lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you\n\nFolks the reason the story keeps changing it's because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on they tried the alpha bank oh that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out their\nShocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advance by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals parrot this to yourself George Papadopoulos did George Papadopoulos is low\nLevel Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed on the information that there you go bingo we got\nWell thank you gentlemen what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a fight that court there is a verification process for the information that you're supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it indicates that the the target let me give you an easier example this book sometimes little cup gave me a bit of federal agent [noise]\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search warrant that I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence of this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting in the house we're looking to get a warrant on\nIs in fact not the place and I felt to include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime [noise]\nLadies and gentlemen the chances of losing their job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nAre significant it's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of this\nThat this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented to the Pfizer court was not that folks\nWas not that it was only the stuff\nAlleged basically in the ... and\nHere say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\n[noise] support and folks\nUh businesses in the towns are going through a who are helping out for instance if there's a bakery in a small town they might bring Bratton and other food out to these people as they hit north but in some cases\nYou have a one in one instance a woman who was pregnant\nOr another with carrying a young child so their families and and young people are involved in these marches as well\nAnd ah I'm Wondering if are taking their chances walking three thousand miles or hitching trains for three thousand miles is somehow a better option than waiting to see the political situation in their homeland or get better\nYeah uh well they can make the argument that they've been waiting a long time for that and that that they fear for their lives at this point the other part of it is to last time this happened lay uh the the numbers have dwindled by the time they got to the U.S border many of them elected to try to stay in Mexico or Mexico granted some temporary visas\nOr to those people who had made it that far but you're right this is quite a journey this is a long journey uh I Would imagine that many of them will have dropped off by the time they get to a by the time they get close to the United states\nAnother problem I Know they're coming across and this is something that's not widely talked about but I Know of it because of my pension for the language and the culture there is a certain amount of regional racism the Hondurans do not like the Mexicans the Mexicans do not like the Hondurans and both of them don't like the Guatemalans\nWow yeah and that's a that it just adds to the whole situation here a while that that's an interesting angle on Ali uh you know that that creates even more friction\nIt does and I think it will ah thanks for the update builds up or a news radio on
