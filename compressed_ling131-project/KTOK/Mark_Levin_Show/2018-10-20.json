way and I'm hearing that the suburban women\nThey're mad and they're not mad at the Democrats\n... this me to sing is resonating with them that it's actually motivating their vote that there is a real danger for Republicans right now that they could lose the house because of this but Democrats can overplay their hand so it's just sort of under the radar\nNow the beauty of filling in for Merkel have been here on the ... coast to coast is that there are a whole lot of suburban women listening right now\nAnd I want to hear from you if you are a suburban woman\nWhere do you stand right now on this

and that that's what's going to give the Democrats the majority\nNo I I Hope that's not not true and I wondered if you'd heard about the walk away campaign oh sure yeah I'm planning to be there and you know other than in Fort Worth and I'm about five of us are going to go there\nAnd take part and I just I think it's going to be I think we're going to fill out the the with a bunch of people that are walking\nAway from the hysteria or just crazy and that's what's going on\nYeah and for those that don't know the walk away movement is a traditionally are people who are traditionally Democrat people who fit the traditional demographic of Democrats they're African Americans Latino minorities women who have a ... as seen through it all now when they're just it's okay to walk away\nFrom the party right now that's right and I started with a couple of people that were with ... that that was walking away from the Democrat Party that now what it is it's just people who want to walk away from her pack or the the violent or\nJust what we've seen in the streets and what we saw during the comment on that with just chill now you said you wanted to hear from what they thought about that are specifically from women yes and\nWhat I saw was it not when it wasn't about uh when it was about one woman accusing one man and the total disregard for ... process for law for evidence just outrageous [noise] yeah and\nThen you think you you put it very Well Nancy ... ... ... ... the me too movement or or meat to storyline he was co opted by the Democrats in and used it was politicized against this one man it wasn't about a moving it wasn't about women it was about him\n[laughter] yeah but it it was just so frustrating to just watch that everything that came up that was not true yeah it's not\nEven calling it out of the of course and then you have the media or anything just\nAll about it's all about what was wrong with them and okay so he was a little bit angry at that last year in a while he was the fellow that craving that wasn't getting ... and ...\nNancy thank you for the call to the market eventually he weren't angry I Would have been concerned about him that I think there's

greater Washington area we had a theater full of five hundred people\nAre here for the station and it was great marked at this great thing at the end of it you know we did like an hour and a half presentation on stage and before we were done\nHe said you know I Want to say one more thing can cut all the ladies stand up the women in the room stand up and it was more than half of the room and it was so great\nThat he did that and and and I love having there's still a bunch of women on the line wanting to get in\nBecause there's this there's this fake phony despicable myth bits perpetuated\nAbout talk radio about what we do here when we when we discuss big important ideas in conservative principles and values and we have this free flow of information and exchange of perspectives they\nWill lie to you wouldn't say it's just angry white men angry white men angry white men it's always angry white man I'm not angry are you angry I mean I mean there are some things in this country that if you're not angry debt ... years something wrong with you but I approached this from an angry perspective I\nKnow that you don't and and you don't care what color I Am I don't know what color you are white and always angry white men they think\nI'm In and so when you when you specifically say I'd like to hear from women boy I can tell you I've been doing a talk radio for years now at the didn't big markets and across the country and when you say women I like to hear from you boom\nThose phone lines just explode\nBecause let me tell you something there's no way you can grow and expand the kind of of communication product that has been growing and expanding for talk radio over these last decades by just being a just targeting\nAngry white men it's a myth it's a lie\nThat they love to say about what we do here because they're ... they don't want a new generation of listeners the last thing they want is for a men and women in their twenties that's when people start listening to\nTalk radio when they're done with the idiots who play music and and uh blow the the ... a bicycle foreign and ring the cowbell and make jokes about a body parts and they they start to you know get real jobs and have to wear long pants\nAnd have bills and are making money and they see how much is getting taken out of their paycheck and they're trying to settle down and actually be a grown up that's when they start exploring other parts of the radio dial and that's when they hear talk radio because they want to know what's going on out\nThere and it usually happens in your late twenties\nEarly thirties that certainly when it started with me in a serious way\nAnd it terrifies\nBut the mainstream media it terrifies big gate keepers in the media who used to be in charge of all of these outlets radio television newspapers they're still in charge of newspapers but they're not in charge\nOf the Internet when was the last\nTime you actually bought a newspaper I mean unless you ride the subway in New York when was the last\nTime right\nAnd so they're terrified and so they want they they put the lie out there they put the lives out there that this has hate radio that it's nothing but a bunch of angry old white men shouting hand so when we have the opportunity to say hey ladies love to hear from you [noise]\nExplodes\nOr the the the best gift you can give\nTo a young person in your life who are just getting out of college maybe or starting to establish themselves in the world would be a subscription to while the pod\nCast of your favorite talk radio host or because that's where things happen that were things change\nSo ladies thank you but I Am lifting the or the gender ban here I Want to talk about this\nThey're calling it a caravan what what is that a

be able to ... that's why I'm for dealing with these determinations before they reach our borders so we don't have the problem from one at a border claiming a fall that's why if they're not from Mexico\nAnd now we're back and it's a circle it's a complete circle la ... sitting in for the\nGreat one Merkel have been I Do the afternoon show on WWE a male and Washington DC right before mark and earlier today I spoke with Senator Ben Carson has been courting\nDemocrats were talking about this kind of it and so my first said you know what do we do about this and he's only going to spend more money to make the country safer and better so that people won't leave and I said okay well that we've been doing that and they are leaving so what do you do when they come to the border and they said well if they claim asylum then then we got to hear them out it's an okay but the economic reasons is not legitimate for asylum\nAs well and that's why we want to make sure that we fix the problem in their home country\nIt's a circle it's a cyclical argument they have no answers and it's a\nIt's slowly lost the ability to walk\nWhat would you remember about your ...\nYou were with them\nOr do you

tonight confirming Washington Post contributing journalist ... show was killed inside their embassy in Istanbul, Turkey earlier this month\nThis is I Know that there was a lot else going on in this election or the the uh antipathy for Hillary Clinton uh the the you know decades of of her\nThey eat invading our living rooms in a very shrill and unlike a bull way or the idea of Trump being the person to name Supreme Court justices versus Hillary Clinton or the promise to tax cut the rejection of identity politics there was a lot baked into the cake in the twenty sixteen election\nThe economy trade all those things but the Senate all aside from it if you ask the men on the street name me one issue Trump ran on the vast majority would be building that well and protecting our border and Republicans I understand\nWhy in some cases but Republicans did not follow through for him they just didn't and they'll tell you is because the Democrats do it in the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was\nOf a threat of government shutdown they'll tell you lots of reasons\nIt doesn't matter they've had the majority and if they wanted to if they really really wanted to they could have pushed for that wall they could have pushed\nFor jumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the U.S chamber of commerce and other ... deep pocketed interest groups who do\nNot want our immigration laws enforced as they're written or it's because they're terrified that they're going to lose reelection\nBut here's the thing they didn't get elected so that they could get reelected I don't know anybody\nWho votes thinking yeah I'm going to put this person in the house of representatives so the two years from now they can win reelection\nI I'm going to vote for the senator so six years from now I can vote for them and get their job is not to keep their job their job is to do with the voters expect them to do\nAnd they didn't they dropped the ball\nOn and forcing our immigration laws and protecting our border and and if if they lose in many respects it's going to be because of that\n\nOr let's go to Daryl in Portland, Oregon your next to Larry O'Connor in for Merkel event hey Darryl\nHow're you doing guys do I watch I watch the border over the\nYears grew up in a Chandler, Arizona and you know they actually had a ... year they had a fear of consequences that if they snuck across the border for a job and they you know you know food or whatever they did\nThat if they ever got caught they were going to get you know tossed out of the country they've got to basically everything that they're welcome more than the citizens and then you have people standing in line trying to do the right way there's no incentive to do it and if you think walls don't work so back to the Israelis\n[laughter] yeah exactly you know they're all it's so funny when you say you know I remember when I was younger people didn't cross the border because if you remember a that movie from Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong was born in east LA\nYou remember that and it was a parody song they did a parody of born in the usa called born in east LA and it was in the entire movie was about him being well actually the irony is his character was not actually illegal but it was but it was about him on the run\nFrom border patrol and from immigration officials who were trying to deport him right\nIf oh if only that really were the case if ... what what has changed for God's sake that wasn't a movie in the eighties\nYou know ... in the beginning it was a ... can't think of who who was in Arizona at the time I mean there have been there forever I mean obviously is not no longer with us but uh\nIt just they slowly that came in more and more and more and then they became later and later on the consequences you know when you get here and then now they're actually given the benefits like hey we'll take care of you know you want to have you know four or five kids go ahead\nOh we're not doing enough for him Darryl Darryl thank you for the call and we're not doing enough for these people who are in this country illegally it's it's funny I I I always hear from people but you know for those who have been here for many years and they become part of our society the ones who are law abiding tax paying\nA uh people in this country or that even though they're illegal we should have a path to citizenship for them and it sounds great doesn't it they've been here they've been law abiding they've been paying their taxes they shouldn't be deported we should give them a path to citizenship whenever anyone says that you could you just follow up for a minute and say I did get a\nHold on I'm sure there's a lot\nThere here in the country illegally they've been here for years they're law abiding\nAnd they pay their taxes and they've got jobs\nCan you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally for years and years and years and they've got a job\nAnd they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition they are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or entering this country illegally but number two\nIf they got a job that means they are by their lied\nAbout their documentation or they were using fraudulent documentation quite possibly they're guilty as an accessory to identity theft\nSays so your argument is a complete and total nonsense if someone has been in this country illegally for years and they have a job and they're paying taxes\nThey are by definition not law abiding they are continuously had bit surely and on a regular basis breaking the law\nAnd the fact is one party in this country apparently still cares about keeping our laws enforced [noise]\nAh speaking of east LA let's go to Kent in Los Angeles wet my my adopted my my first adopted home now Washington this is my second adopted him you're listening on the great age seven to the answer care LA or I Can't what do you make of this\nAll right um [noise] well I wanted to\nTalk to people about getting out and vote in a case that false pole and ah [noise] are convinced chauffeur showing and slander also discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd the overall media onslaught fish the scourge many conservatives on the right from voting mhm they're only about Seventy percent of the u._s. citizens Eighteen years for an older group for President Trump for the primary for\nAbout twenty five percent of the general for for you see there are a lot of people that aren't voting I think actually most of them were both conservative is they're going to have voted for\nYeah it can do you think though at this point after what we saw in twenty sixteen and and with the new trends with regard to polling and how you know people don't even answer the phone on their cell phone if they don't recognize the number did you think people still do believe these polls do you think that uh I I think that people just inherently\nUh believe that these polls are phoney and fraudulent they they're I mean when was the last time they were accurate\nYeah well I think often not probably the case but it's it's similar to the fore Anders that people don't actually believe the frontrunners for what they believe is that other people will believe him and they won't get out the vote show they think they're that\nListen to that is definitely the danger and and and ... thank you for the call out there in LA uh I I don't disagree with you that is a danger I think though that this president the fact that he's rallying and going out and doing these rallies or several times a week between now and election or the fact that the the cabin on\nHearing I still believe resonates and I do want to believe that that was a motivating factor for people\nI think and and and back to our topic of the hour that caravan\nThink when people turn on their television and see thousands and thousands of people waving the flags of their country demanding entry into our nation\nI maybe I'm naive maybe I don't get it but to me that is the\nFree advertising for Trump in the Republican Party that we will ever see who wants to be on the side of the party who opens up our borders and says you betcha come on and take whatever you want because that's what one party's position is\nWhat's one got to do with the other\nTell you what let's have a vote on the wall and then we can have your vote on amnesty step up this is not about compromising this is not about trading horses this is not about making a deal\nEither you're for protecting our border or you're not you're either for granting amnesty to people who continuously break our laws or you're not stop with the ball\n\nLet's go to Curtis Ocala, Florida Curtis your next up on the market in show\nHow you doing the good what do you say\nHey let's go do it but uh I got a chair or do they shut down the border ... ... ... because of the tracker that at the carpet or cross over into the checkpoint you open up and it's the checkpoint and the other\nCountries where the illegals or the fight as a legal at that point but people who wish to come in this country that is in their own country with the proper documentation Suzie us as safe as like going to get a passport yeah and that was what\nCurtis remarkably you just quoted what existing American and international laws are it's remarkable that that's thinking

C. W. M. A. L. is ah in the nation's capital it's the talk radio station of record in your capital and uh I Do the uh the show right before mark\nRight for three hours after new drive a Larry OConnor I sit in for him then goes Marco events do on my way home I listen to mark the here's the thing I Can't listen to anyone else\nI I'm I'm too afraid that I that they might plans an idea that I Will inadvertently take or or you know purposely take a bath and and also it's funny when you get into the business it's harder to listen to talk radio because\nHe you know you sort of know what goes on it's like our filmmakers looking movies they don't look at movies the same way you when I look at movies because they're looking at how it's been put together sort of that way for me with talk radio now but see with mark\nFirst of all he's incredible I Love the show it's very different than my usual show actually um and and and frankly because he's on immediately after my show\nI you know I'm going to buy these days\nThe news cycle the stories what's important what's happening now\nIt changes five times before\nI'm On the air again Twenty one hours later so I can listen to mark and I love listening to mark a ... and and I have no fear of you know taken any uh his his ideas are is winds are is takes because by the time I'm On the air it's all new it's all different as\nI Love this opportunity to be able to sit in for him and I'm so honored to be able to do it and that's a huge thank you as always to mark a an to Richard and rich and uh and Stephen and everybody a Becker at the mothership who's who's helping out here [noise]\nUm ... much more to talk about here and I do want to continue to take your calls on this caravan and what's happening or south of the border\nAnd the fact that it is coordinated and it is planned ended his organized by may use the word organized because you know organized\nIs sort of a a a modification of the term organizer or if I may community organizer you see our nation had a community organizer in chief and what we're seeing here this is what community organizing\nLooks like the the the demonstrations the moms the the screaming the disruptions the of black lives matter or the ... or ... disruptions of the United States Senate the marches in the streets the stopping of traffic this is\nAll community organizing and and I guess we should be used to it by now this is this really how we want decisions made in this country based on the screaming in the streets\nBased on thousands of people demanding entry door Cody so we're so we're now going to change our immigration laws and accommodate these people were not going to make laws in the United states of America because thousands of people from another country\nCharge across our border and demand it\nMaybe we will have a red way you know honestly maybe maybe if if this is really their plan if they really think this is helping may maybe we'll actually grow our majority\nIn the house the Republicans will\nCause this is this is the greatest thing I think\nThat could happen to Republicans if they stay the course and if they follow the lead\nOf the president who has been the you know you may disagree with his tweets you may disagree with the little language he uses you may think that he stepped on his own message sometimes you get to listen\nAnd and guess what I Would agree with you on a ... um most of that\nBut on the policy on the actual things that this president has been able to achieve\nI don't know how a conservative Republican on the whole could have an argument for what the president's been able to do with the judiciary with nominations to the courts with taxes\nWith military spending with foreign policy even trade I'm not a huge fan of his rhetoric on trade but so far the threat of terrorists seem to have gotten results\nUh and and as far as I'm concerned load up the tariffs against China they are not our friend they're certainly not our economic friend\n[noise] so we have Republicans could actually follow his lead on this and ... and finally jump on board\nWith regard enforcing our immigration laws and drawing a very very firm line in the stand ... you know a line in the sand backed up with concrete rebar a steel\nPretty high maybe barbed wire on the top maybe some drones patrolling where you can't build a concrete rebar steel line in the sand you know follow through on that\nYou'd be amazed you'd be amazed at how things will go\nA will continue to calls in a moment I I Want to circle back to an issue you know my friend Dan bungee you know often sits in this chair as well and I've known down since I first they actually before I even came to Washington and he's been so great on this issue with Spygate and with the FBI and the doors and ah all that jazz and I've been doing a quite a bit on that story", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "20"}
