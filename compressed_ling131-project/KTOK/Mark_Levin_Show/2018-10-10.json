show to talk about the winners and losers of what happened with a\nWith a course today Kevin ... on the U.S Supreme Court number one the biggest winner I think is due process in fairness\nThe principal and old fashioned principle but the mob does not rule and not the presumption of innocence supplies and that some sort of the substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump not seeing it one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office the Trump search scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero\nThe economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle has won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the God of the seasons in Beijing and communist red China that takes about five hundred billion dollars a year so the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them\nSo when Trump gets done with the Chinese and it's going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according harassment and it came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit he hits back harder what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you're not guilty judge Kavanaugh your an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them and only has stack up he continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world and it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh\nWas a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin off further and further and further Kavanaugh kind of look ... looked over Trump and said that's my motto that's the guy I Want to be they never imagined other whip the middle aged judge from Yale had in him to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion because\nBut Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his or all of his grade school girls' basketball coach in your teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he he\nA sense hypnotic ... took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine four testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the cost of phobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth what was she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one of her witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapist notes or critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens and the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not timid Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to rape her\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she flipped and change what she was saying in order to\nTry to take Kevin down and it didn't work\nAnd the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes or boyfriend or many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is the disease swim all of these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up\nOn Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great\nBut do not think for a moment in the fight is now over it's only just begun you fool we've got four more weeks to go\nI cannot imagine and America when Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer\nIn charge of the Senate and the investigations that would be launched and all the problems that arise so tonight I Want to get your perspective mark Levin is off until Monday he'll be back then was some well deserved time off\nThe great American built Cunningham is here so I Want to also let you know that a Marshall

John please go ahead\nAnd show the following this thing for intently from start to where it is now and ah\nAbsolutely I agree with your opening bottle first off facts are stubborn things you know and and the words of our of our\nPresident you know John Adams if you're just dissected and look strictly cracks and you go off the values of the country that you tell proven guilty it's absolutely mind boggling you can't wait to no kidding a conclusion of all this guy he's guilty\nJohn last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about how how unfair it was that the president declared a innocent a bread Kevin\nIsn't that what he is aren't you innocent until proven guilty and this wasn't the case but it just wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine to give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the U.S Senate\nKinda walked a Christine afford down the ... path when she oddly question her about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector test and now I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something and what she knew was that the ex boyfriend oh Christine afford and by the way Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend who sold his credit cards but I redress\nOr what it was the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend for taking a lie detector test\nOr the under oath to a sworn affidavit a boyfriend and Christine afforded the Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governors administer polygraph exam\nAnd so practically everything\nThat Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taking airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector test\nShe did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that that is the only conclusion and one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting that kind of a tactic actually allow\nThat that's that's terrified because you're now hey take somebody a lesser degree or a lesser a common life whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just coming back or something like that\nThere could be no coming back whether whether you know just the fear factor and it can be absolutely false at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life is\nWhat John orders for Kevin all go to get back his reputation you're in the marine corps of some other fellow marine a woman accused of rape and there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know what had happened didn't know how it happened and the foreign witnesses she supplied to be witnesses turned out to be non\nWitnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw ... and here still found guilty about and bounced out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight [laughter] that would that would be it wouldn't come back you know but then again I wouldn't get their due process went from such\nA thing you know John I I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what uh\nUh someone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to question you to say wanted someone still for no it was a Chevrolet if so if you go in and say my left foot turning I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault\nTen to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho were wrongfully convicted of sexual assault a Gregory counts and Van Dyke Perry to black guy spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was the host or university case were for college man at Hofstra were chores raping an Eighteen year old fellow students\nThat came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accused of someone of a sexual assault for all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look or in the eye which the Senate denied and now that we took ... know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media\nOut how much you could save and why men is share is so popular go ... dot\nCom or called eight six six eighty eight Bible that's eight six six eighty eight Bible Medicare dot com or eight six six eighty eight Bible\nLiberal elites were those do some common sense to you from moving\nHere use radio one thousand Casey okay\nOn our radio [noise]\n\nAnd one\nThing can I put to rest the idea that this president is not normal I hear about the norms and the presidency\nLet's talk about norms of presidency going back to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was that normal\nHow about the eight years of a William Jefferson Clinton sexually assault and Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping Juanita Broderick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky that he violate the norms of the presidency moving on to Bush forty three\nIncreased taxes increased Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in a war in Iraq the costs four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran\nThat Bush forty three get us into the norms of the president says that normal then you had Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV is not the norm of the presidency\nSo please save me liberal media the idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency\nThat John F. Kennedy violate the norms and the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to other male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the ...\nAnd then the one that will be J lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered the Nixon violate the norms of the presidency\nWith water grade in line did he violated how 'bout Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the president's he so please save me the embarrassment of trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency as if Obama\nAnd Bush and Clinton\nAnd Bush and LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms of the presidency please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show please share and go ahead\nI I just wanted to say thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley row aren't that he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities you wanted to pull any direction they encourage it causes much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me ask you shown as your question talking about the norms and all I'm Liz listen to the liberal media today because they think drop last night violated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy ice crazy eyes Booker\nDidn't violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate ... think a little bit\nI think all violated in orange butter center I think that behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point in the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November ... member of the eight twenty sixteen men or it might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election\nAnd aren't haven't they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse because they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that do not bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as I say it's sick\nAbout accepting the results of the election\nWhether it's the Russian collusion delusion or whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should have resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama but what happened is\nThat that uh when Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amyloid abnormalities I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more of it if we have the trade deficits we used to have a candidate in Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nUp all this as abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is a normal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nOr I'm with you and I also did test that that they will not acknowledge anything good\nAny thicker every bit as good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has does Donald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm I'm perfect you know he never did that so he tries\nHe tried hard hard working man for a million that doesn't have to do it well I have ultimate respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAt that too is sick today Sharon we got her run thank you for calling from Pennsylvania is Chuck Schumer which they get out and vote\nIf you do not want Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to be controlling the legislative agenda for the last half of the president's first term get out and vote must continue with more a seven seven three one two three one one still counting on the great American in for the gray one mark\n\nDidn't change in an instant these things are very quickly all it wants to hear\nAnd read about it tomorrow or the way to be watching tonight to wait until five o'clock news or the eleven o'clock news or hear about\nWhat happened what is happening today happening right now on air or on demand\nYour smart speaker to use radio south\nKatie okay why FM Ninety six boys wanted\nExpected tomorrow ... Fox News hurricane Michael a dangerous category three storm it's now two hundred fifty five miles south of Panama City Florida\nNot taking the storm lightly and neither should any family in the state I spoke with the person yesterday and he just to prove that pre landfall disaster requests we made yesterday because it allows us to bring more federal resources towards [noise] both declared a state of emergency and thirty five forty pounds Florida\nLindsey Graham she ... she needed to be investigated hours and I that's the way I feel\nEvery name she supplied of witnesses turn out to be false every factual detail that she provided turn out to be false you know I think what happened Jeannie in reality\nIs that when you go to a therapist or to a doctor\nYou are incentivized to tell the correct story because you're seeking help\nFor your problem so if tomorrow junior you go to a doctor and say my left hand is hurting\nThe doctor believes what you're saying if you go to a therapist\nAs Christine for dinner and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated and she told the therapist that there were four boys who tried to write me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that\nHappened I Believe something fundamentally bad happen to her steam Ford which is why she has been seeking mental health for all these years\nAnd probably what you told a therapist incentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys tried to rape her in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind shared recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens and became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties it became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn in Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine for it\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle\nDo I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she told the therapist who rented a room in our house that caused sort of put the second front door in our house so patients come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago that four boys tried to rape me in the in my late teens\nAnd the mid Nineteen eighties then sell 'em out in her mind to get fame or to get money she decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys you said it was one instead of late teens I was Fifteen set of the Nineteen eighties let's make it Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stamford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took that Democrats are wrongfully league current name which by the way it's a crime Dianne Feinstein office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage or require her to come forward and won the Senate said when\nThe Senate said will come to you in California will make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation of Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers or so perfect for um her responses drew out\nI'm feeling some sympathy say we're absolutely perfect um to make you on our side and afraid to challenge her\nI'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer\nReferred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue\nBut this woman probably had something happen in her life involving those four boys that tried to write a paper and that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident then damage your life so much she didn't get two master's degrees and a doctorate\nThen damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five years at\nPalo Alto University in Stanford\nAnd and not so bad she isn't written or co authored sixty one books and periodicals what was she would have done Seventy one books and periodicals there is no evidence that affected her life at all and every factual statements she made before the Senate was either falls or purposely ally one or the other\nThey've all been proven not to occur and Jeanie you're a woman and of course your femininity it's been hijacked by the Democratic party\nDo you want to live in a country where your son your brother and your father does not have due process\nAbsolutely not I Am a Christian and I follow what the Bible says I think a man should be the leader of the house um I\nBelieve it you know you you can't say that you can't say that you can't say yes I can I just don't know that that's a terrible I'm a\nDemocrat the police Jeannie ... don't do that\nBecause men and women are equal in fact women are ... you know the best people I've known in my life or women whether it's my wife my sister my mom passed away about five years ago\nMy granddaughter those are the best people I Know and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit there and be told as a man that I don't care about sexual assault against women when I think about women I think about my wife for forty nine years as an appellate judge and the state of Ohio I think about my sister\nWho's the co chairman of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio I think I'm On my beautiful little granddaughter I Want to protect the women around me and make sure they have all the rights privileges and immunities every citizen\nBut I also want to say that there are times ten to twenty percent of the time when men are wrongfully charged with sexual assault and due process\nFerrets out the good from the bad the right from the wrong and then we from the chaff\nI wasn't Mendez due process rights because that guarantees down the road\nThat wrongful convictions for rape and other crimes which happens hundreds of times every year in this country will be less likely I Want women to be protected and I think men have rights too in a sense the me too movement there's nothing wrong with the me too movement as long as rights and due process goes along with it\nAnd if somebody's charge whether it's a title nine violation\nOr rape or sexual assault or a groping I don't want my wife groped or my sister groped that's disgusting and if somebody groups a woman I Want them to be held to account\nBut every now and then a woman Cristina forward either doesn't know the truth or tell us ally and when that happens I Want the presumption of innocence to make sure it's available for innocent victims who've been charged such as bread cabinet Brett Kavanaugh as one of the biggest victims in this whole thing would you agree\nAbsolutely I I mean I agree with you I don't think women should not be protected they needed up on a pedestal\nAbsolutely ... more respect for women than men because I've known to many men in my life and I respect women\nA lot more than I that that that I Love and men because I Know women are the best people in God's green earth we got to run Jeannie thanks for your call from Texas but continue with more of a

Monday you know tonight Martha mckell them of Fox News's interview Chuck Grassley and he's been primarily told by some Democratic senators they may try to impeach Kevin ...\nOf course you can only impeach of federal officer\nFor high crimes and misdemeanors committed while in office so he's been in office one day this morning had his first couple of hearings and the Democrats already one to impeach and they don't want to teach them what they want to do is raise money\nTo use and hearty Hi camps race in North Dakota for example or Joe Donnelly in Indiana and that's what they want to do they are threatening to impeach when they're never going to do that because it wouldn't fly you need fifty one percent of of the house and two thirds of the Senate it would never happen\n... if there's a God and having the Republicans will keep the Senate for weeks Trump tonight will know better\nThat are so that the federal judges the pipeline can continue but imagine the absurdity of the modern Democratic Party when having had his first day on the bench and the Democrats want to impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nUnbelievable let's continue now it's sunny and the great state of Texas where the cowboys can't win Sonny welcome to the mark Colombian show Sonny please go ahead\nOh I'm\nA ... call ... or ... or ... or ... or ... or ... but with possible they could do the ... the construction on the go to the router Ku Klux Klan\nWell Sonny you bring up an excellent point you know but the party of the confederacy\nIs and was the Democratic party they're the ones who declared civil war on my country and killed about six hundred thousand total soldiers so that I'm a credit party is the part of the Ku Klux Klan as the party of Jim Crow Democratic Party is the party of lynchings\nThe Democratic party is the party of the destruction of public education currently and the welfare system it's responsible for most of the criminal disasters as say like in the city of Chicago\nThe Democratic party from reconstruction the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow lynchings collapse of public education in fact about eight percent of Detroit or Chicago public school students that are African American read at the appropriate level\nAnd so you're talking about a massive dumbing down of the population to keep them on the modern plantation which is the Democratic party so Sonny ... behavior you're seeing from Democrats has been repeat it for the past hundred and fifty years some cold than the demon rats but not Democrats or the demon rats\nAnd what what we're seeing the restaurants and the and the airports in the elevators today is mild compared to what the Democrats did in the Nineteen sixties burning down about a hundred American cities so I wouldn't put a lot past them because Democrats are now shooting US Congressman other Republican\nSo wherever I look I see the disaster the modern Democratic Party not covered by the mainstream media sunny do you agree\nOn quite a\nNice sunny we gotta run thanks for your call this continuous more let's go to Jim in Brooklyn I Love Brooklyn Jimmy in Brooklyn welcome to the mark ... show Jimmy go ahead\nGreat to hear you again listen when we hear about the radical left the far left we see what's going on in the schools we see the crime you see on TV for\nThis is the result of liberalism now let me give you some quotes from the communist training manuals to communist right use the system to destroy the system the communists right the best way to help the cause of communism is through the liberal wing\nThe Democratic party the communist right yesterday's left us today center today's left will be tomorrow center that talking about the whole American political system more to the left so they have a\nHighly organized well trained group with in the Democratic party that the strategist a tactician\nThere are a lot of our professors there are a lot of our teachers there are a lot of our congressmen and senators so when you see the Kavanaugh hearings you see the Russian probe you see the violence and Ryan ... and all this stuff that's part of the left movement which is anti American it's Marxist and it's also largely anti white\nJimmy let me explain this to you also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration was traditional ... telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so the organized left inside the federal government would release transcripts of the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him\nAnd to marginalize our new president he never had a chance to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things that were presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese here\nThe senator from Beijing this is foreign influence in our government a foreign agent of red China like congressman Dianne Feinstein she won that started this big hoopla about a ... a judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh are allegedly raping and all that stuff\nSo they influence is more than than numbers and we're actually I think a very big trouble and out of nowhere comes Trump\nYou know it is by Chris ... give me an update on the committee chairs\nOkay so you were talking about what happens if\nThe Democrats win and and one thing that I've heard and I wanted to point out is we can't let 'em have how ... how to speak because uh the committee heads have subpoena powers and they'll just continue these investigations on and on and on with these broad powers\nHow 'bout that fat slug Jerry ... are taking over the house Judiciary Committee can you imagine that\nWould be terrible I mean\nWhat I mean what legislation would pass what what activities on our behalf whatever occur if Jerry ... learn Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are in charge of the house of representatives what positive things would ever go on\nNothing that I could think of it\nEven if we got a new Mueller out of the picture oh jeez\nThey would they would just keeps the painting and keep investigating investigating and it would be nonstop investigations that when the house so we ever I Want to encourage everybody to donate all you can do what you came out and cheer volunteer all you can if you can't donate than get they're not doors\nIf you see a sign for you know the the other side the Democrat\nBe as nice as you can wise you can't try to ... people why why you've just curious why you vote for for this person because the reason\nYeah because you know there's you know there's plenty of reasons not to vote for him and just being is not in about it but engage them and tried to get them to talk a lot of people you know they they're bandwagon fans or whatever they don't really know what they're voting for they're just you know want to be part of the crowd so trying\nTo talk to me about ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose the Texas Senate seat to a clown like beta O'Rourke is that possible\nOr it is possible I don't think it's going to happen though because um you know the betas got this Kennedy esque vibe about him you know he was young and yeah he's\nA you know some people I guess finding physically attracted eight different strokes for different folks whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd you know there there's obviously some liberal natives here you know in Austin area and some other Houston Dallas\nA but most of most of Texas is you know pretty normal solidly conservative normal there ... yeah yeah but yeah we've got people moving in her changing the demographics and so\nUh it's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise blues we've not we've got to have him when\nSee what's happened in Florida is too many New Yorkers have moved to Florida\nAnd they're taking their virus in their cancers ideas with him from New York\nFrom the Empire State to the sunshine state they're taking too many New Yorkers are moving in New Jersey I Can't stand the place anymore are moving to Florida so Florida I think is kind of like a purple state at this point\nIs gonna be hard for the for the governor and when the U.S Senate seat but you know Scott ... is pretty good governor but nonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flipped Texas or Florida\nThen the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one it's over with and and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican can get elected\nIf in Florida and\nNew York uh begin to be as one enough taxes looks the same electorally as New York then we're done goes Texas and Florida would tip this thing permanently\nWell I'll leave you with some good news or clean I I was not a Trump fan okay I was pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president and I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't\nSure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nAnd I look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning because I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would've done\nAnd you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence of these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles as Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey wherever you want to say\nDoesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there's an animal magnetism that I see president I think is an Iowa denied he hopefully it will be out everyday between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa loving thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Orange County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up this guy's ... a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz whatever done but crews doesn't have the magnetism does not have the charisma\nDoesn't have the charm or whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and all like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circa twenty oh four or Whitney Houston circa twenty oh three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to write that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan look like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruise in there but my eyes were opened and here's what miles rope into that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump\nAs a president or not because he's the most godly man but because I Believe that this is ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\n... and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald you know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that confident fake and just do what we need to do individually to help\nThis country to get back to where it needs to\nImagine if Hillary was in the White House who would be on the Supreme Court would you have Gorsuch which Kevin ... you'd have to Ginsburg look alikes and imagine the status of the country then an RPG the notorious RPG at some point going to meet her maker and that's how I Want to Amy Coney

wouldn't be hard to prove they hate us\nIt's not going to happen in Oregon I guess but what about the U.S department of justice doing it what about Jeff Sessions in the FBI and all the rest what about that\n[noise] I agree that's where it should come from the top\nBecause you know in Charlottesville will not one white skin ad ran into a crowd and killed some woman he was charged with a murder in Virginia then he was charged with a hate crime now I don't know why it's a hate crime if a white person kills a white person but\nI went back to spend the rest of his life in jail because he killed in it as a woman who was protesting I'm with them and when and when when white supremacist march or on Charlottesville yelling about Jews you're talking to a guy this practice law would choose most of my professional life I'm disgusted by that\nAre running around Charlottesville at night with tiki torches talking about the N word and about Jews that's bad stuff it happens but ten times that stuff happens on the left all the time and it's never confronted in reality for what it is which is ... from the left\nThere's much more hate from the left and from the right there's many more hate crimes on the left and on the right but they're never prosecuted that why are they\nNo no they're not\nWell shame we gotta go thanks for calling us move on to John and California John and California Welcome to the Mark LeVine show John please go ahead\nI Want to ask you a great legal mind a question from the school to get drafted by over their control in the streets in Oregon and the mayor's ordering them to the police to stand down so that people can be assaulted their property can be destroyed the mayor be charged for aiding and abetting I'm also against\nYou know forty to USC Nineteen forty eight is a statute that deals with one state authorities act or under act on the color of state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon as part of an unspoken conspiracy the object of which is to violate someone civil rights you have the right to travel and when these individuals in front of Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property\nAnd then when authorities did not arrest those individuals\nHappen in Washington DC this was under color of state law or city ordinances city or state officials acted as such a way so as to deny the human rights of Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we had a functional department of justice and\nJeff Sessions these things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color of state law and the fact is not ... not and the other thing that drives me crazy John\nIs that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine large numbers of radical individuals taking overs intersections and a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking white citizens'\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler doesn't arise and say not in my city there's tape on Fox tonight\nOf Portland police watching it going on and doing nothing about it because the mayor wheeler doesn't want anything to happen this is despicable this was wrong it can happen in America\nVying for the call gender to go forward or you didn't even expect the governor to step up and say I'm going to bring in the national guard I'm gonna take my state back I'm gonna take my feedback I'm not going to tolerate this maybe somebody above it needs to step in the federal government but we can't have America like that they have to do all this violence\nWhat what I think the mere Portland believes what he's doing is politically popular he's doing what the citizens of Portland want him to do and elected him to do it\nAnd so how is it possible that a great American city not in the south but Portland, Oregon allows in ... to take over city streets\nBlock intersections line in front of federal buildings making an impossible for federal agents to do their job and the mayor of Portland a clown effect was full name wheeler does absolutely nothing to stop it because it's politically it's popular to do that in Portland, Oregon\nYou know John how is that possible how do we get ourselves in this situation the instability on the left is unspeakable\nLeft the state says a leftist movement that's all they are saying thank you for your a great job covering it for the great one\nJohn thank you and when I watched what happened on the Supreme Court on Thursday Friday Saturday and even today on Brett Kavanaugh's first day on the job large numbers of individuals in violation of federal law committed criminal trespass on federal property\nAnd I'll watch them climbing on top of an statues and scratching it the doors of the United States Supreme court how\nHow do they do this in public committed ... literally thousands of crimes in public a few are arrested there find like fifty

the Democratic mayor so it would be there would be a hundreds killed millions of dollars of property destroyed all hell breaks loose\nAnd average Americans looked at that and said we didn't want Humphrey and sixty eight or take Nixon or promises law and order four years later the chaos continued cities continue to burn administration buildings taken over in\nCollege campuses murder was rampant and what happened in Nineteen Seventy two Nixon one forty nine out of fifty states\nBecause the average Americans live in Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Ohio Kentucky Indiana Texas Florida couldn't look at it didn't like what they were seeing on TV\nAnd you had a candidate promising law and order and uh we're working on behalf of the moral majority in the silent majority and that current candidate is the president Donald Trump he's doing what Nixon did in sixty eight in Seventy two\nSo and Hillary Clinton playing the part of you were a chump free says the rules of civility or suspended because Republicans control the Congress and once the Democrats take over then the rules of civility we'll be imposed once again\nIt is it blatantly stupid comment\nTwenty eight per by a margin of twenty eight percentage points\nIndependent voters believe the Democrats acted like fools or the Kevin all committee hearings by a margin of twenty eight percent a great number see Hillary's

as saying I'm with them the ... demonstrators that black lives matter protesters who demand the murder of cops what are we went dead cops wondering want them now that black lives matter protesters that say pigs in a blanket from like ...\nThat's what is encouraged men of the Democratic party and the last couple of years of the Obama administration has black radicals and white apologist all over the country scream for the murder of cops and it happened in Dallas in Baton Rouge and all over the country\nYou might recall that brought Hussein Obama into the White House took the founders and representatives del Rey ma cats in and others a black lives matter\nIs if they had a point to make that cops are racist murderers systemically which is not the case every now and then you have all the corn McDonald situation in Chicago where top should not a shot that boys sixteen times\nEvery now and then you have something bad happened the one point one one percent out of Ninety nine point nine percent when cops to water right\nBut the argument is not that the occasional cop occasionally does something wrong the argument for the Democratic party is the cops are an occupying force there not worthy of being protected and loved you not worthy of our support not worthy of law and order and so when a candidate like Trump promises law and order\nThe silent majority will arise and stop at the Democratic party once again to overplay its hand with Kevin ...\nAnd I don't know if the fire can be maintained another twenty eight days twenty eight days from tonight\nWe're going to have the
