thousand Casey okay am an ex X Y FM Ninety six boys want to\n\nStop the United states\nWe only had our public opinion changed by seven percent that entire process that was at seven percent in other words most people are pretty stuck in their basic morality\nBut a lot of times people will go you know how is it that this friend I've had over a year turned around and stab me in the back\nWell that's all part of the sliding scale morality\nAnd I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics with the you might disagree with and just the overall frustration do might have about politics in this country let alone\nThe moral outrage the moral outrage by the media on back of Kanye visiting President Trump\nHere's how the sliding scale morality works\nUnless you're potentially this bond is Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility I dunno Chuck Schumer I've you'd be so maybe you know as long as you're not the the sponsor saying or or maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo on a scale of one to say that one is evil ten is perfection we're all Tuesday nights\nAnd therefore at our best were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that mean well means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than that but let's say that you start out and on that sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life\nBut when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting your rent for his first you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you have thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here so let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit\nSo many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nThat you have people that defend Christine Ford how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapists when he wasn't even accused of rape\nBy the way well I mean by anybody other than I have an Audi I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place them around to begin with\n... you can make it up as you go every day you view of things through the prism that you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about UN's climate science and went frauds they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial for on the conversation\nThe reality it's broad bunch of people lying to you but it's all part of\nOur morality today to where I can lie to you if it suits me and when politicians do it\nIt works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd she I Believe should ultimately be tried for it\nNow I had somebody saying well her witnesses the ones that ended up refuting her claims maybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this list there said\nThere may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of ... who could be they didn't remember another might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool cool so you can committed felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as you're reasons are good enough\nIt fit sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about the sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you kidding me Twenty years ago today\nWhat what are we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media\nThat sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West and the oval office\nThat is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more than ever before it's important to know\nWhere your moral compass happens to be\nOr you five six seven eight where are you where\nYou're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life who are they do or they are they fix is not a good day in threes on a bad day\nYou know last week I was talking a bit about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people of things politically and I mentioned the unfortunate reality\nWhich is you have to find people who are open to information the first place and the problem is you don't have a lot of open minded people out there as I pointed out with a cabinet deal there are only seven percent of folks top to bottom that ever had their opinion change about him seven percent through everything that's it\nSo you got to find people that are open minded and open to information as I pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut at the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated if you don't want to be stabbed in the back\nIf you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself and add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because any more\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party\nOur couple institution at low vision for Hillsdale dot com that's

Bush was racist no [laughter] I did I go\nDuring the country in the relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes was mesmerized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that everything was taking place yes\nIn fact I actually went back in and watch that but a lot of uh the total series Berra earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today as it was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was a combination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time\nHe's looking he'll look a gun you look at the teleprompter and look at gun yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran\nHe said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts [laughter] but yeah\nAnd and then his back and then we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers picks up\nIt starts reading the teleprompter and all the time moment anyway no I I don't think George Bush was\nIs a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there and if you don't try hard if you don't try to introduce policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success you need and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nThey can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates especially with the black community that's a Donald Trump story\nSo you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a racist Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nIt has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare providing a path in an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you how to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump is doing\nNever forget I've lived many lives even though I'm I'm not all that old I a pack a lot into a given day [laughter]\nIt's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know I keep going be I I um I had a smooth the company had a manager there one time\nAnd uh end up getting a call and call came from government office doing a unemployment verification jak verify the employment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike OK so hand the phone ever to employ and conversation takes place\nAnd I could tell after a couple of minutes that it was ... she was getting upset she was getting really upset\nI was like OK gets off the bone and she tells me\nKnow what to do just happen Senate making too much money\nSingle mother she's a single mother and she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey were actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why\nIt took a catalyst it at a gang James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties why didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well I of course open change when I was a bunch of bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at him\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keep an economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need them okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nAnd what do you say\nYou see somebody like Tania who obviously is not an ideologue was not a Republican\nOr to the test in your own

interesting couple of days but an interesting week and a well the more things change the more they stay the same which is the hostility\nAnd the most pervasive form a bias in the media which happens to be old mission now they're talking about the ... effect throughout the course of this first that we're all with a sliding scale morality here's something else that you probably don't hear about too often\nNow we have had according to the media Research Center\n... news busters now Ninety two percent of the coverage Ninety two percent of the coverage of the Trump Administration by news media the negative Ninety two percent of you you compare it to Iraq Obama the same point about forty six percent negative\nAnd you know where we were in the economy you know where we were in this country a couple of years into the Obama administration\nHere's something that you also don't here again the omission\nYou don't have the media\nMedia is always happy to say oh here is a poll that shows Donald Trump bad whatever approval\nRating but there's been a true wisdom pretty much the entire Trump presidency the more informed and engage a person is the more likely they are to approve a President Trump\nAnd that remains the gate because we're a little more than three weeks away from the general election if you take a look at an average of various different pulling out there you'll see that among adult only samples President Trump's approval rating about forty three percent\nAmong registered voters at pretty much around the same but among likely voters we've continued to see it rise\nYou'll see some pulling rats was at one point is we got to fifty one percent and an average of all likely voters the president's been averaging around forty six forty seven percent now that might not sound great but let me put things in perspective for for a moment\nDonald Trump's approval rating at this point in his presidency compared to ... bombers among likely voters his approval rating happens to be right now three points higher than Brock Obama's three points higher\nNow imagine this for about a president with Ninety two percent negative coverage compared to a president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet\nThe one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most informed those that are most engaged\nIt it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is or isn't in their wallet this was true of Obamacare\nAll at the lives that were thrown out there were perpetuated while that whole deal was going down\nIt was guaranteed not to work it was guaranteed to fail but hey we've got a bunch of people don't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change showcase Obamacare is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nNinety two percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that well you know about the you know if you like your doctor you keep your doctor and all the rest of that\nSo people understood as soon as they had to pay for it we're in a similar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage law folks get upset about the way things are portrayed but remember that if the media media generally had the type of influence\nThat we think they have if they\nHad the type of impact in elections\nAnd that many will still assume they have there's no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nThey you know middle they want the people know that they're making more money people know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better bees are all things that are facts and it's why the most informed and engaged are more likely to approve of President Trump\nIt's why we might actually be a one of those inflection point in American political history the kind that might actually lead and Republicans not\nLosing in this presidential election cycle [noise]\nThese are all the things that are on the table [noise] something else [noise] but you can't lie to people about [noise]\nYou can't lie to people about financial fraud and we're gonna talk about that and Medicare for all coming up next because Medicare for all is the biggest financial fraud ever professor wait I'm Brian mud in the gray one more glued to\nThe news radio one thousand Katie okay am an ex X Y fmri Ninety six voice wanting to\nJourney home my lease the samurai Fox News American pastor Andrew Brunson now in Germany for a medical checkup after being released from house arrest in Turkey earlier today families folks enjoyed and secular\nUp with them to an amoral place immediately\nIt's a false premise it's based on Medicare for all its financial fraud with the president was pointing out there the eight hundred billion over ten years that's diverted here is what actually happened to Medicare he's a hundred percent right it's not a political talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago Medicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency in the twenties thirties kind of like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of\nPoints real quickly and here's the first one\nIf we already are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know it was going to happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal according to the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in year one nine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare see\nAnd it gets worse every year from there that currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it\nYou got a hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick Fifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens\nWhen we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\nAnd it is financial fraud that's is bigger than Bernie made off yeah you have a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we've got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it\nFinancial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud and by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to order discriminatory all race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist when's\nWhere we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you one of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have ... it was the Trump candidate\nWho is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott who was term limited and running for the Senate\nAndrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians they'll know\nYou won't have the most liberal and less just governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and he got well that sucks to be you and for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of the five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode the wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination which is thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is\nThey now consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with us money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check so as you hear Michael Bloomberg sounded like he is the the the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this race ... is critical and again there is one platform piece in particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic when you're talking about the governor's race because won't Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter Andrew Gillum has also run on impeach him President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate it's why it's important to inform simple concepts like this if Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got Fifteen Percent on it\nIt is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's going to get better there is no way without\nMassive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve\nWhat they're talking about but if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we've got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a not exaggerating I'm not making it up it's according to federal federal has a basic financial literacy test\nAnd right now more than sixty percent of adults bail it a basic financial literacy tests and that's part of the problem we have with conversations and concepts like this\nDoesn't matter how educated one is\nGenerally if they're financially illiterate than these concepts might be bought and sold kind of like hope and change and Obamacare\nSo having these conversations making sure that your financial informed making sure your kids are financially informed pretty important not only for their everyday life but when it comes to concepts like this because ultimately it's not complicated\nBut it is brought its financial fraud is dishonest and it's guaranteed to fail\nWe'll come back and talk about another\nThing time fraud perpetuated on us the minimum

interesting moment ... but again you know when you've got\nThe the dragging energy and you've got your mega Superman ad on things happen you know it's really hard to get to channel all of that and and

once he got a dose of his own a kind of thing there\nAnyway are talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial fraud again if you miss what I had to say about a half hour ago it's not complicated and and this is the way the shutdown dropped the Mike argument you have\nA Fifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's pace it insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent a hundred percent of folks at work or on our contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when you put the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that is the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country\nAnd eat it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is perpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult beans financially illiterate and again now my opinion\nProven by the NRA sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational here but here's something else that is a fraud that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person that take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody why haven't seen any benefit from it well that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a at a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers didn't they didn't put the tax cuts so\nIt's all going to be reconciled when they filed their taxes but they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they'd actually be at the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody's uh I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything now the next part that fraud comes in with companies\nYou hear how awful the tax cuts are because evil corporations you know the the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back all their stock and you know do what rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy\nYou know that that stuff except that that's a fraud as well as dishonest to its ally the a C B say you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] bad the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC what their CFO council\nHave found a a few things that are interesting for\nExample what is the the most common way to has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not ... percent of the corporate tax cuts\nThe share buybacks right this horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone to a combination of bonuses and employ you raise is\nThirty five percent twenty percent has gone to a debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps to company become more stable essence their debt burden with rates rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of sheer ... by ... in debt and payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated informational lead by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the ... the past few days ... with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary\nThat's six issues of a Mac celebrated magazine and it's all part of an a Mac membership get tricked copy of the latest edition of the a Mac

going to be harmed in any way for them on the radio\nLocal news heard here every day news radio one thousand to Katie okay [noise]\nBeen [laughter]\nOff it made me feel like Superman who made a ... favorite superhero nah\nWe're going to be on it however you want to do it [laughter]\n\n[noise] you know\nOf the things that you didn't necessarily know specifically we're going to happen with Donald Trump is president but hey you know there would be the moment so\nDo a little bit different you know uh and yes you have the fame to outrage the the moral folks in the media that are all my gosh the profanity Twenty years Twenty years removed\nFrom the oval office equally in a blue dress to Kanye West is using profanity and the oval office is somehow or another Twenty years later oh just reprehensible but the president's\nYou know doing a a little Lewinsky thing I mean that yeah that was okay oh that was\nActually part of the Nineteen Ninety eight mid term election that whole impeachment effort which is interesting because really the number of different comparisons you could actually make between that midterm cycle in this one but are they talking about some of the\nMisinformation out there the fraud that is Medicare for all talked about how much more money we're really making that take home pay up six point seven percent year over year\nAnd then you get into this recent study that was really just mind numbing it's why we have the broad being perpetuated that is Medicare for all survey\nRepublicans believe us economic system is fair to most Americans Democrats don't came out earlier this week Republicans believe us economic system is fair to most Democrats don't\nHere's the irony of all this success not exactly being partisan getting Kanye West not exactly you're right wing Republican conservative type\nBut guess who else isn't like all of your richest self made people in this country for a few names of the richest Americans for a moment\nJak basis Warren Buffett Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates\nYou happened to notice a trend here they all happen to be left to ease once again to science histories one side effects so why isn't that with the rich as the most successful the wealthiest individuals in this country\nActually bean left to use that most Democrats feel the euro us economic system isn't fair that gets back to what I pointed out earlier this hour\nSixty percent of adults being financially illiterate but here's the more important point and this is another shutdown argument if you want it you'll have people talk about how much more fair it is elsewhere well guess what the median world per capita income\nIs ten thousand two hundred Ninety eight bucks and the United states you\nCan't even legally work fulltime and earn less than sixteen thousand dollars a year\nSo yes the minimum wage in the United states which as I pointed out a little bit ago\nOnly point six percent of the population orange is approximately sixty percent higher than the median income around the world so to all the folks who said that our economic system isn't fair nobody's keeping your ear good luck to you\nLet's go to Ryan in California Ryan go\nHey uh as soon as the tax uh\nThing went through I've paid attention to my paychecks and\nRight when it went through I noticed thirty dollars more and I went to all of my co workers where I work at a Bush\nAnd all those guys are like well I've got thirty and so it was like thirty to thirty five bucks that the federal government wasn't taking away from me so those crumbs that Nancy Pelosi was talking about actually makes a difference\nShe wants she comes back man [laughter] she wants or crumbs back but I have a fight\n[laughter] good stuff British in the rye once again you can lie to people about what they don't know [noise] but you can't lie to people\nAbout what is more isn't in their wallet\nAs Ryan just pointed out to be right back talking about the broad that is the un climate ... for the gray one more glued to\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the\nEighty thousand Katie okay am an ex X Y M family Ninety six boys one agency\nHeading home I'm Lisa and the camera Fox News the American pastor held in Turkey for two years now in Germany for a medical\nCheckup pastor Patrick Brunson was living in Turkey for two decades the family when he was suddenly accused of being linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' party and a separate movement which turkey blames for a coup attempt in twenty sixteen he was convicted but the espionage charges were dropped and he was released after serving two or three years\nThat will provide some price transparency part of the importance in breaking the back of this model\nIf we did then you would have everybody that would have to compete\nOn a service and\nOutcome type of model just like we do with everything else just white you know I I make the analogy to all of their insurance products in our lives if you end up having a you know a a minor\nIssue with your car you go to a mechanic he get it fixed you can shop around you can see what mechanics or reliable which ones do you feel good about see what things cost and make that decision if you get into a significant accident\nYou end up filing an insurance claim probably just looking for a good body shop at your insurance company will go and work with right you're not doing as much shopping there to the first thing you know even if we can get to this place are going to be some exceptions\nBut don't imagine they'll ever be a good time to be shopping for the best price when you're having to go to the emergency room for some major medical a bit right ah so that would be in a moment where it wouldn't necessarily apply there might be\nSome other major surgeries to where it wouldn't necessarily apply I mean they were talking major surgeries complications that you don't even know about until you get in there are so I you know there are some of these things will never be solved a by being able to say oh okay well this has everything I Need medically and here's the price\nBut again for all the basics\nIt would provide the level of transparency and that's kind of the the more important point generally but to your specific situation\nUh again I I feel for you and and I wish you the best and I hope that you can find a some providers nearby that would be able to assist you they can't provide some level of transparency what I have done and I'll tell you that it's not always the most popular thing\nAnd it's not necessarily or something that always comes with an answer\nBut I Will ask people in my wife's got good at this to asking how much is this going to cost\nAnd\nIt can lead to the health care provider kind of running in circles and every now and then you won't get an answer I have actually\nNot obtained healthcare and in some instances because they couldn't tell me how much something was going to cost I Walk\nNecessarily just signed a piece of paper that says hey whatever happens in here I'm going to pay for I don't provide any of them my Social Security number because they don't have a right to it\nSo in that context you can ask hey here's my situation what am I looking at and hopefully there are some providers that might be able to provide you with the least some guidance on that type of information\nBut again not God Bless them and best wishes to you and if anybody comes through some specific information make sure that uh you're you're a information there uh we uh we have it and I can get in touch with you I'm All right so\nSwitch gears here for a moment away from health care over to another major fraud by the way\nAs we are getting into this climate talk you're going on who is this guy it's clearly not the gray one no you're right and I'm more like the little one I Am [laughter] I'm Brian bought 'em yourself for different\nAh yeah I Do a morning show W. J. you know in West Palm Beach and humid morning show on W. I. O. D. in Miami and I'm always a pleasure and an honor to be here with you and filling in for the great one\nAnd uh you can catch me I Wonder have probably ... radio\nAnd I live on some principals suicides histories one side effects\nI operate on the premise I Will never accept a false one and I will assert that anything that's built upon the false premise is destined to fail and also tonight have talked about the sliding scale morality I think it helps explain a lot of what goes on in our everyday life\nHow some people can seem like they're good people in good times and then turn around and stab us in the back\nOr in this particular case how we now have the political party that's basically embraced or a lack of morality to where they are willing to be dishonest and lie about major issues that would impact every American like the fraud that is Medicare for all for example\nAnd then have people buy into it the political party that will perpetuate a series of of lies and deceit like Christine Ford and I believe her\nAs Chuck Schumer Dianne Feinstein and many Democrats did because then their constituents believe them creating\nA whole major segment of this country that embraces a lack of morality and a lack of honesty lack of integrity and decency but we also have that with climate stuff and the un ah the the blessed to us\nBy the way Nikki Haley was about the only thing good at the un\nAnd now she's heading now\nHow many people would necessarily miss it if we we did just go ahead and say well I've got to subsidize the Oregon subsidize the UN and man that is a fine real estate in Manhattan and we happen to have a president knows a thing or two about Manhattan real estate anything\nAnyway er here is a headline and the specter that was brilliantly done\nGood news we now have until twenty thirty to save the earth\nIs just an excerpt from the specter story according to the IPC the report we now have twelve years to avert climate catastrophe\nThat might not ... but it means we're good deal further away from doomed than we were in two thousand seven when the WWF said we have five years to save the world the doomsday clock hadn't moved in two thousand eleven when the international Energy Agency ward now we would have five years\nTo starts flashing carbon emissions or lose the chance for ever\nBy last year it shortly to three years\nAccording to Christina figures the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change but now it's right up at twelve years presumably maintain that we can pretty much ... ... or ... until twenty thirty a whole Eighteen years after\nThe WWF told us the world would come to an end if we didn't slash carbon emissions\nTheir tongue in cheek approach to pointing out how disingenuous dishonest and wrong the United nations has been year after year after year with their doomsday you report but what happens year after year after year\nYou have the same folks in the media the same folks on the left saying votes in education\nAnd raised in a single again this that you weren't magic and I I you know I I've always taken a look at a meteorologist and then gone man\nI could not imagine you end up every day being wrong more than half of the time getting a paycheck\nAnd feeling good about um life these people are worse than that\nEvery year they keep jobs there well respected they go on this speaking surrogate it's\nFascinating to watch so the question is when will credibility better and I'm going to break down how little of it has ever existed at the United nations in with this crowd coming up next I'm Brian mud in for the great one month\nWe've had a minimum of three mass extinction events remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur flatulence you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more political than than like a you know cars so if you just had if you think about it is it the Peter crowds to really think about this for a moment if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens you care more about the the gal or do you care about or you know your your climate change there because it gets you we're more cows who's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this anyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of diner flatulence and I dunno flatulence ended up leading to a master\nExtinction events that will be just you know falling off the logic to its natural conclusion\nYou see [noise] ah [noise]\nOnce again two sides to stories one side effects [noise]\nI enjoy the facts and will continue to bring them to you [noise] [noise] Hi I'm Brian money and for the gray one march was in [noise]\n\nDo you remember when comedy was great it was a medical wasn't profane and

Casey okay [noise]\n\n[noise]\nVoice of America in a fairly seven seven four years one for years ... to sort of looks like there was a\nTornado so unique spot where [noise] you know everything was down in DC [noise] and it's like a tornado weather [noise]\nIs Florida's governor Rick Scott who is term\nLimited and actually running against Bill Nelson for the United States Senate in one of the\nMost the board races in the country because Rick has a chance to any Republican pickup Bill Nelson has not faced a tough competition pretty much at any point he's won his election in Florida by five twenty two and Eighteen points and\nThe Rick Scott right now is in a statistical tie a it's kind of unfortunate he he's even in the ... been a easily a top three governor during his seven plus years\nAnd he has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way\nAh I'm Brian mud informed more clip in by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida quite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but but nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nWhat you buy what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas they give you an idea and the comparison real quick a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even have some of those images in your head\nAnd one of the things that I ended up noticing\nWhen we're taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures that looked an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott say there's like a tornado\nWell it is you know in hurricanes a lot of people but to focus on the category and the tops of St when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them ... about almost anything but the wind just says you solve with Florence and the Carolinas just as you saw with Harvey in Houston\nLast year it's the flooding storm surge flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage in death and hurricanes rarely is it about the when now Hurricane Andrew was about the wind\nWhen you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the F. one through the five tornadoes go right\nWith top sustained winds than a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an F three tornado I'm very fortunate my ... my my family has been trying to ah\nTo give me a heart attack I was saying I Am I got my parents and my sister and my brother in law veteran Naples last year or ma I hit them directly they ended up being alright ironically and I'm On the other coast I'm south eastern Florida\nUm I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through tore up some of the power lines near us they were out power for like going to do actually fared better where Hurricane Irma struck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother in Panama City beach use all the reporters through Michael Dell run PC beach give me an idea and he has a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are that close just a matter of miles and that's because we're talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a tornado\nThere's something else that is kind of a an important in the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be a long any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you could be on the Gulf and take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI ah I had an idea there is one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nAnd affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures of Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but debris and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went\nBack and took a look at the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three well before those standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "13"}
