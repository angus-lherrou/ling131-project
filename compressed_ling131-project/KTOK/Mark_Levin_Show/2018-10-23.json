site we definitely we're spending every dollar the Democrats are under full assault here\nI got to tell you I was out there early voting hours at a rally with Governor Abbott twice one in Austin wanted San Antonio and he's obviously now gone down to Houston but the president and with Senator Cruz\nIt's been a great day uh we've been all over the district people are fired up and I'll tell you early voting numbers are really high really really high they've smashed all records on I think an area that indicate that on both sides of the of the aisle if you will so we've got to do our part to get the vote turned out because if we turn out we wet\nYeah early voting in Texas has started as with other states and ladies and gentlemen if you hear me right now I really don't put this off get out there and voter and you know what the early voting was set up by the left\nTo try and a and a change the system you can take advantage of it to go ahead and vote early and the more uh people who do that the better now tell us\nHow your race looks in your district\nWell uh you know it mirrors in many ways Sen Cruz is raised\nA and it is a a you know tight and and and and hard fought but very winnable race or with the support of your listeners a lot of good Texas we build good but we feel that it's necessary for everybody to show up\nIn order for us to when my opponent as I think you know is a a a very liberal Democrat very liberal who served in the United States Army and I thank him for a service but he uses that to try to claim centrism to claim independent that he's running in his dad\nBut there is nothing centrist nothing independent about somebody who has already said he would vote to impeach Donald Trump who's already said that he would undo the tax cuts was already said that he would put in place that carbon tax\nIs already said that he wants to regulate guns he wants to single payer government run health care called Medicare for all and he wants to take away resources from the border patrol and give him the other country\nAnd I can go down a long list but he is trying to run as a centrist then he's not but I think the people of Texas are seeing through it just like they are seeing through Mr O'Rourke\nA efforts to a claim centrism and if that set for them that were in San Francisco and not the center of Texas\n[noise] and a lot of these leftists in Texas and Florida and these other states are really trying to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't that\nOh I mean I Can't even begin to describe to you how much are worth seeing that both with congressmen award as well as my opponent and others are the Democrats very purposely went out and recruited leftists\nWho could run because they may have worn the uniform or otherwise good are wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation because they know liberalism doesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something market I think you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my opponent he never as a response\nWhy would my opponent or why we'd better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or senator to do all of the socialist things weren't at least it's constitutionally reasonable to have the debate\nMatthews a Berlin thousands STAR One thousand and our guest is James Lankford our senators joining us on news

thousand STAR One thousand Harry is in Oklahoma City Hi Harry Hi thank you bring it on\nA on a shutter this uh\nUm my mom is headed toward harsher border ... bay the alternative to keep them from coming across our border because our military can't do anything out of state sale that there are a\nReader or National Guard and worked at the ... like do\nYou know here you had a very perceptive question that I read some folks say well we'll just in the military down there and they'll do it but the military is not Floyd deployed within the United states that's outside so National Guard typically go to the border which I've had some of my liberal or friends that have said\nYou know I Can't believe President Trump would send down the national guard to defend the border and smile damage they do realize President Obama sent the national guard down during the time that all those unaccompanied minors were coming across the border and twenty Thirteen President Obama\nDeployed the national guard to help they typically are not doing law enforcement because of the border patrol or federal law enforcement folks they're enforcing the law of people crossing the border the\nNational Guard actively doing the second level of assistance setting up tents supporting the the law enforcement not actually doing the arrest so they're in support functioning eye to answer your original question\nI think President Trump's plane this exactly right you communicating to Honduras Guatemala and Mexico this is your responsibility these are people now in Mexico that are illegally present Mexico we would expect you to be able to enforce your own law there and not be able to say not our problem and we're going to send him to the United states\nAs so attaching her aid at bay engaging with the Mexican government which is in the final months some people don't do it at the Mexican president was just elected the new president starts December the first should these are the final months of the uh the now leaving a president so it makes it more complicated to be able to do that and be able to leverage on them\nBut to be able to say enforcer law the other thing to note is a when you ask for asylum people say well they're coming here because they want a request asylum the international norm for asylum is the next country\nYou don't leave Honduras and go to Guatemala and go to Mexico and then go to the United states and demand asylum asylum rules internationally are the next country you go into your request asylum if you're going farther than that that's not asylum that's economic advantage and uh so you don't you know for instance is\nOr if you're injured in a car accident you go to the very next hospital this right there you don't go three downs over because I think the carpets better in that hospital than the one that's kosher you go to the one that's closest on that that's the same thing with asylum and those folks are clearly breaking the rules they're not just going for asylum\nThey're coming for economic advantage there is a way to do that in the United states it's called legal immigration and we want folks to do with the the right way\nThe other thing that I've noticed because I Do speak Spanish and I I speak with many cultures from from that part of the country there is um an inadvertent lying below the surface racism\nOr between a lot of those like the Honduran don't get along very well but the Mexicans the Guatemalans don't get along very well with Hondurans and so on and it's all a cultural battle that's going on there is there is\nAnd that's even so in Guatemala yeah Yeh different people groups that are even within that country and they don't receive other people ribs I remember visiting with the\nLeader of one of the embassies from Costa Rica several years ago\nAnd she said to me well you know in Costa Rica way of immigration problems but Nicaraguan come in but Nicaraguan do jobs that Costa Ricans won't do [laughter] and I laughed and I really did you say that and she said what what I said you you could say that in the United states right now that they'll come in and say they're on during summer coming to jobs Americans will do but she's saying that in Costa Rica\nYeah James Lankford thanks for joining us are we still have another segment so April one thousand are you looking for something more\nNew
