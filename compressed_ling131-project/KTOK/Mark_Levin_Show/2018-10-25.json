know there's a race for the Senate Mississippi it's not talked about much outside of Mississippi and there's a gentleman running who I've always been a big fan of and his name is Chris McDaniel and he's running for the Senate Mississippi how are you sir\nI Am great mark thank you for having me so\nWell it's my pleasure and explain to everybody in the nation as well as in Mississippi how this particular election works\nWell it's a special election you might recall that in twenty fourteen I ran against a forty one year income but by the name of Thad Cochran we're feeding Mr Koch when the first night\nCame back out any scared forty thousand Democrats and play Republican primary and they stole the race from us twenty fourteen well I remember that yes\nThere are just like your ... died they then time a senator Cochran stepping down perfectly so they get Harold select the next senator from the fed and Mississippi were so happy to be a lifetime Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter by the name of the high Smith so they appoint hurricane position and now that means we're in a special race\nThrough fulfilled a roommate and drop that term so for people in the race non harvest that he has no parties declared and what happens if the top to advance to a three week run off after November the fix\nBut the bottom line here mark here we are again for the establishment conservative person is the same old machine in this kind of going to take them out\n[noise] why would the governor Brian I Believe his name is why would he appoints somebody who's been a lifelong Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton who ... more recently became a Republican why would he appointed to the Senate\nWell Mark I think this may surprise mugger listeners but Mitch McConnell those like me very much and I don't like she'll very much either so it was then then Mitch McConnell met with the governor and hit the structure to the governor were anyone but Mack Daniel so\nSure enough they polled all the statewide against me and they didn't work out very well so they finally found this one person who didn't help much name id the thought process was despite the fact that she was a lifetime Democrat we cannot pointer\nWe can write a whole bunch of money we can find or as a Republican even though she hasn't been and she may have a great chance to win so that's why it was Mitch McConnell hand selected or this person at the beer the appointee\n[noise] you know I Know ah there's a lot of my conservative brothers and sisters out there who are now think the world and Mitch McConnell I Do not I think what he did in the case of Kevin was something that any Republican leader must do and should have done if they can't deliver\nA a Supreme Court position or when they control the majority in the Senate I don't care how small the majority is a that would have sank the Republican Party for a decade in my view now having said that\nIt's actually more than that you were a constitutional conservative explain your views\nWell I'll go all the way back I was the state's lawyer against Obamacare I represented the lieutenant governor and ten other petitioners\nAgainst Obamacare but here in my positions are I guess outlay outlined for you I I Believe strongly that the constitution I'm an originalist orientation I've I've read your book men in black and understand the power of the court in the bottom line here is we've got to find people that can construed the document as originally intended\nAnd that means rejecting this a living constitution nonsense that's pushed by the likes of Kennedy and uh certainly or and the like\nWe need to find more skill is more a Clarence Thomas's more individuals like Gorsuch that can stand the construed this document the way it was meant to be\nAnd what that means simply is the federal government is way too large it's doing way too much article one section it gives an over our supposed to have all the other powers belonged to the states and the people respectively so in every vote cast in every speech ... the idea that decentralized\nThe power of the federal government and give those hours back to the people\n[noise] Chris McDaniel tell us a tell us about your race in Mississippi how's it going\nIt's going very very well obviously the establishment\nOr they work hard to cut off our money supplies so that's one of the big fight so we always
