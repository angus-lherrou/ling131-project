get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up to protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\nNow all of this I said to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this filling in for mark before or many of you know me I I played tennis in college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation

they didn't yell and\nThey love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break into your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation says\nYou know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation in Saudi Arabia\nAgain he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally it ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out there will be a very strong response\nFrom this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust somebody actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as they compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media treating him with his caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\n\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough done this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's on hands and he's a terrible person they should come down and she'll be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is do you want a president that defends his country and fight for this country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care venting to the United states and then when he does that you criticize them for doing its thing he's on hands these crazy and he's mean an evil and have so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing it normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come into ... and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually in pure did they just allow women to drive and the only reason when they limited driving Saudi Arabia's because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal\nYou still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb they will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut our feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or to criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify what Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights\nMy point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and it's taken a life of its own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him\nBut his but but but the media who's acting like this is something we must ... where I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\n\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know why we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism and that part of the world and they do things that we don't do\nWe also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agreed that it's important they all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama Obama agrees with Bush in ... with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other votes agrees with Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is the only been dealing with all along\n\nI gave you that compare and contrast to now how Donald Trump's villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they said this\nDefeat driven by family since Nineteen fifty four I think your child to swallow the ramifications gotten into your household products had a reaction to a wider sting called the poison helpline first for fast free advice from medical professionals call one eight hundred to two to one to two anytime anywhere said the number single life ... by the U.S department of health and Human Services\n\nThursday October eighth team what is the day on the free I heard a radio\nThirteen Days feel Halloween kind of focus in on the scary fine and get into Syria with the\nHeart radio original vision Halloween radio commercial free Halloween hit that are both of mine in the area [laughter] won't pick that perfect Halloween costume by your candy\nFor victims to help you with all those activities we radio Manohar radio\nWeekend box office review\nIt was a repeat of last week's top to starting with venom repeating in first place were thirty six million down a better than expected fifty five percent from its opening weekend that puts a Sunday total with one hundred forty two million in the U.

I Would argue virtually no soul and the reason why I say that is based on facts and the way that she tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts\n\nWhere she did everything in her power to destroy a good man and his family name all because in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out with an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\n\nShe says that American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax credit a five hundred dollars at six thousand a year\nUnder new legislation they announced today by the Democratic party the Democratic US Senator Kamala Harris of California she then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nShould be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year\n\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is why\nAmericans are working harder than ever before right now because of jobs are good and the and the economy's good and many people went from part time employment to full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she just said that sense is is is nothing but a ... is a lie and for all the people that I ever are obsessed with the fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in our own words is ally\nI'm not going to focus on that for for that that's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you Harris's office as she rolled out this plan today cited a two thousand Seventeen survey\nFrom the website bank right dot com\nThat found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected expense such as it rent increase a medical bill or child care\nNow bank rates survey came out and it said their headline of this phone survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings aid rely on in an emergency\nSo what you have is you have\nCome out of hairs are saying okay Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me because people can actually pay for their own darned phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps where we are seeing record numbers of people fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in a great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I got to do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank great dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford to pay five hundred dollar unexpected expense\n\nLet me just explain to you how warped this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first part of our proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year\nAnd the reason why she wants to give you that money every month this because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with the rent increase a medical bill or child care so she wants to give you a government subsidized money so that you making nine hundred nine thousand nine dollars a year\nHave an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected\nExpense now my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody who's making nine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me make just a December correctly because I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out so that said it wrong so I'll correct it right now calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for a five hundred dollar unexpected expense\nYou're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money is going to take your government money\nAnd then go Oh thank you you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to say that money because that same dumb a hasn't saved five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nMemory when we had the tax credit that came out the Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they would they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right people to save that money they got extra money and they went out and spend it right away\nGo work at the stats\nAirs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of every single month on average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year that they're now going to save that money every month for an unexpected medical
