I go to a liquor store so often I made friends with him\nAnd I'm a well he is excited about being able to sell domestic six point beer he wasn't allowed to do that before\nA ... and and because of the goofy and is with a law now he's going to have to invest and refrigeration if he wants to at least match what people are going to be able to get at the grocery store now here's what will change though Jerry most people when they're buying their beer and they're buying their wind they're buying their food too\nSo that will that will hurt the liquor stores a cause so are\nThey still under the rules that you can't buy at nine or ... on Sunday and stuff like that\nNo no that's the other thing so you know like you said I think it will hurt the liquor stores in the long run because the grocery stores can sell on Sundays the grocery stores can sell past nine o'clock I think\nThey're going into the liquor stores are stupid on Sundays but there have been a business of it as we go to the same as the grocery stores OK okay they\nOpen the door open later that could stay open later alright alright\nOkay well thank you for all your enemies I've been listening to him at all and really good and a\nMultitude of overtime and Jerry I mean I I agree with you there are some of the ones that are poorly prepared I don't think are going to do whether there's there's a there's a I'm not going to name it but there's a a a beer and wine there's a a white basically it's a wine job it's a liquor store but they sell more wind than anything else near my house\nAnd then there is a liquor store and the wine shop that only sells wine and sells a little bit of liquor but I don't think they're going to survive because\nIt's going to be too easy for people to pick up the wine they want at the grocery store and the beer that they want it to a grocery store now the liquor stores that concentrate on having a lot of different liquors and and ah you know rum and whiskey isn't and ... and all that and then get the refrigeration for the beer\nAnd then continue to sell the beer that you can't buy in the grocery store some of the more exotic types of beer I think they'll do well because there's a lot of exotic pallets here in Oklahoma that are are happy to go to a liquor store if they want to get\nTheir carling black label or their ... to amber\nOr whatever [noise] news radio on thousand Katie okay Marco them coming up next [noise]\n\nUse radio one thousand Katie okay\nThis is first Oklahoma act this report brought to buy the Oklahoma town so I've never\nLived cattle at one hundred and Thirteen dollars and twenty cents was down Seventy seven cents on Wednesday December live cattle at one Eighteen forty down a dollar seven October feeder cattle down a dollar Twenty one fifty seven eighty seven November one fifty eight Seventy seven down eighty cents\nOctober lean hogs down a dollar five sixty seven forty seven December fifty seven Fifteen down two dollars December corn at three sixty four and three quarters down two and three quarters\nMarch at three Seventy six and three quarters also down two and three quarters December Kansas City we down three and three quarters of five Eighteen and three quarters marched down four and a quarter\nDecember Chicago weight down for five Fifteen and a quarter marched down three and a quarter October gotten up twenty seven points to Seventy six eighty five December also up twenty seven points November soybeans down four and a half at age sixty one and a half in January down four and a quarter\nSelecting the right insurance company is a huge decision Oklahoma Farm Bureau insurance is different while we offer great coverage on auto home life commercial\nFarm and ranch we also have a local agency you know Seventy seven counties now back\nHere to visit okay athlete insurance donkey Kong today life insurance and nobody products or offer through Farm Bureau life insurance company property casually products were offered through Oklahoma Farm Bureau mutual insurance and affiliated companies\nHi I'm Lindsey Graham a dairy farmer from Blanchard, Oklahoma\nDid you know that Ninety seven percent of farms are family owned\nThis includes my family's dairy farm dairy farming is more than just a job for my family it's our way of life\nTo learn more about the dairy farm families behind your milk and life on a dairy farm visit their discovery zone dot com\nNews radio one thousands Katie okay am decay X.

more outrageous than Saturday Night live when it dealt with Kevin ...\nDid he make a fabricated accusation like the multiple fabricated accusations that have been made about Kavanaugh\n\nWhile I listen to what the president said and you know what it was very ... very very mild cut to go\nWhat he's going through [noise] thirty six years ago this I don't want to be right I Am wondering well do

been lost on everybody there's three other women involved in this missus Kevin ... and the cabin all girls to hurt anybody concerned about them on the Democratic side not one person not one person\nAnd where to believe everything Dr Kevin off a doctor or a Ford says I found a very credible and I I don't find a credible\nDot in terms of er accusations against Kavanaugh I find the opposite and so does the woman prosecutor who questioned her and so to all the women around me in my life\nThey don't believe in either\nAnd they trash and they they degrade and they\nVilify and they all lie about Kavanaugh but\nI'll say a thing about the Ford touched them on and she's the bubble lady you're not allowed to say we're not ... and they create this environment\n\nThat this is really about women who've been molested no it's not\nNot in the least\nThat Democrats aren't talking about wanting to broader Democrats aren't talking about Kathleen Willie or Paula Jones or the hundreds if not thousands had been molested by the Kennedys and the Clintons in it no no no no it's not about all women who've been molested\nAbout one woman making accurate\nStations against one man and the woman's accusations don't\nHold up if you are rational\nAnd relatively objective about the facts they don't hold in fact they don't even make sense\nOr you must be attacking all when I'm not attacking anybody

witness Leyland Kaiser her lifelong girlfriend scene for the first time as close family member confirmed she did not corroborate school friend Ford story to the FBI a weary looking Leland Kaiser was seen for the first time\nKaiser fifty to whom form described as your best friend had holding my arms preparatory school in Bethesda, Maryland was her final hope for cooperation however the former pro golfer couldn't corroborate forward story when she was interviewed by the FBI on Saturday I Believe this is Bob ... ex wife by the way\nBack to the daily mail TV exclusive photos for the first time since news of Ford named her Kaiser showed the stress of being put into the national spotlight the closest relative expressed anger at Ford suggestion the Kaiser cannot recall the party because of the quote significant health challenges\nAnd why aren't the media all worked up about how through a fellow female Cleveland Kaiser under the bus\nShe can't remember it because of significant health challenges the health challenges have not impaired her memory\nBut being caught up in the cabinet scandal has proved physically trying to her the relatives said ... is not a well woman she has had years of injuries that have been that have seen her have fourteen operations she just wants to get better well that's a very compassionate Christine for it I Would say what New America\nI just thought I'd bring this up because which women\nAre we supposed to be protecting in defending in which women are we not supposed to be protecting and defending\nNow that renovation at her home\nWith the two doors the two front or I just thought it was odd the whole thing came up\n\nWell it's kind of odd people have looked into this real clear investigations looked into this don't they found\nThat second door wasn't there for an exit that second or lead to a refurbished room in a bathroom where businesses were run out of it\nOr the room could have been rent it so that ruin was created with that door not because\nOf any er psychological issues or difficulties ... points at a real clear investigations\n\nNow was created as another form of a of income\nYou start adding things that these things up it really does create a problem doesn't it Mr producer\n\nI mean you go through this one thing after another after another and of course now they're indignant that the up yeah I did interview Kavanaugh why she's going to change your opinion\nThat argument doesn't even make sense why is she going to change your opinion of the FBI that can be perjury I don't think she'll do that and I didn't even interview judge Kavanaugh well why should they is he going to change his opinion I don't think so\n\nAll we need to get into the truth no all they do is interview people and ask them questions write it up and handed over it's only been said four billion times that that's what a background check is\n\nSo what is it that the FBI needs to find out now if they really did interview\nDr Ford then they should take with them\nProsecutor Rachel Mitch roles memo and as well as several the points I've been raising\nAnd then have Dr Ford square the circle that would be a real criminal investigation\nAnd they could do the same with Kavanaugh but I don't see any contradictions in his testimony deal\nI really don't\nI don't think you have a lot of ex Kavanaugh girlfriends coming forward and saying a while he lied about this and he lied about that and now that's not true\nHe did like the fly and er he wasn't claustrophobic and I did this and he did that there's nobody who said that well you have this old guy what he said he threw ice\n\nSheets realize [noise] luckily didn't throw lap or an ashtray I like Hillary Clinton [noise]\n\nIf you have are we allowed to talk about the truth anymore and my life I had a dear friend is a dear friend he wrote me said you need to be careful about this stuff I said I'm being careful and not being mean I'm not being rude I'm just laying it out [noise]\nThe way I say [noise] on the other hand\nThe Republicans at stake the Supreme Court's at stake I'm not gonna ... I'm not going to hide under the table\nAnd I'll be right back [noise]\nSo why after him Ninety six point one\nMissing [noise]\nAnd to have a party in one point of our history where its primary objective was to protect slavery another time in its history its primary objective was to protect segregation a war fought over slavery\nRiots in wars if he will domestically fought over segregation\n\nThan they claim the mantle of civil rights\nWhen it's the Republican Party\nThat oppose slavery that oppose segregation those were not a Republican governor standing in the door house and then the Democrats tried to rewrite history well you know the old Democrats or the new Republicans no they're not\nNo they're not in the least the old Democrats are gone\n\nThey didn't turn into young Republicans\nBut this mindset\nOf nullification you can see was sanctuary cities secession you can see it in California where the radical left\n\nThe mindset about destroying individual human beings the mindset about old white men and phrases like that it's the Democratic party\n\nThey just change their approach it's all about power the Democratic party cannot survive if the nation is United\nWhat is the Democrat Party the Democratic party is an entity a political entity that is made up of disparate parts based on race based on religion or no religion\nBased on income based on age\nAnd so forth and so and it is the party a balkanization as the party of tribalism\n\nAnd so when you and I when we tried to discuss the constitution the declaration these are very quaint ideas to the Democrats but they really have nothing to do with anything\n\nThere objective is always how to get power and how to keep to advance the cause whether they want elections or lose elections why do you think we have this massive administrative state the early progressive tell you why because elections come and go Franklin Roosevelt tells you why\nThat we will only have\nTemporary control over the instruments ... of governed but we need to make permanent our policies\nAnd so they have bastard dies the federal judiciary\nThey've created a fourth branch of government and this massive administrator state\nSo even when they lose elections from their perspective they're supposed to win when they win elections they tell you they have a mandate so they never lose\nWhat an Obama said when they lost the when he lost the mid term during his presidency\nThat all those people didn't vote he represents them and the ones who voted Democrat so in his mind he had a perverse idea that he represented the vast majority the American people including those who didn't vote and the Democrats who did vote\n\nYesterday and now today the New York times a massive story Fifteen thousand words that's like three chapters in a typical book\nOn Fred Trump's taxes and tax returns going back to the early to thousands what did they get that information where did they get that information\nIs is a civil liberties union we're forced to file federal income taxes we're forced to file death taxes we have no choice we have to give it to the IRS in state authorities\n\nThe New York times said it had a one hundred thousand pages\n\nThey went through to be more accurate went through one hundred thousand pages\nThat boxes and boxes of material if it were you know hard copy as opposed to a a electronically and provided well they got it from the government obviously\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office the attorney general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue what did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it\nNow and half of the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that but for his father he could never have achieved great well you've never seen the peace like that written about the Kennedys ever and you never will\nOr any of these multi billionaire families\nWith a father and grandfather created the initial wealth\n\nMost of you are familiar with New York city aren't you\nAll those buildings\nWith the president's name on he created this\nEven in areas where it used to be warehouses and so forth along the Hudson River\nHe rebuilt that entire area they want you to believe that Donald Trump\nIs a lousy businessman as a lousy developer and but\nFor his father he couldn't succeed there's some concern\nAbout that and they go on about how he he's a tax ...\nFirst of all as I understood these were his father's tax returns but why is he attacks cheat has he been adjudicated attacks cheap now has he been adjudicated attacks street administratively or judicial like no\nNo he has\nWhat is the president's supposed to do now you know full well when you have these ...\nBut the last week I think this will backfire I Hope it backfires you've seen the ah the ugly underbelly of the left [noise] I'll be right back [noise]\nI enjoy

a left wing hack he's a phony he's a fraud and he writes for Esquire\nEsquire doesn't everybody get asked ... isn't anyone in Esquire Magazine of they were ... don't you know\nAnd it's a story written at the federalist website an outstanding website with an outstanding writer there by the name of Mollie Hemingway\nEsquire is Ryan Lizz a published they lend lease story alleging that representative Devin Nunes has has a quote politically explosive secrets unquote\nThat he's a hypocrite on immigration policy and that one lives I went to a small town in Iowa to blow open the conspiracy he was met by our townspeople who treated him poorly\nTurns out that Noone as doesn't have a secret that he's not a hypocrite on immigration policy and that the island's lizard met were wary of him slowly driving around town while children were led because they discovered laser had recently been fired from his job for sexual misconduct\nOh my goodness he couldn't get on the Supreme Court I don't think he could he's a left wing Democrat Devin Nunes has a secret the article begins so what is this politically explosive secret must be a big one right well no the secret is in secret\nAt all and it's also entirely irrelevant newness comes from a farming family in the San Joaquin Valley of California ... a lot of family in California who have farms and include on the farm or including the farm he grew up on it\nAnd you may want to sit down for this new knows his father sold his farming operation in California a few years back and bought a farm in Iowa\nYes that's\nThe political explosive secret\nThat's the secret except it's not a secret\nLiz ... admits that Noone as his parents' farm to California to tell two thousand six and that quote ... uncle Gerald still owns a dairy back in Tulare, California\n[noise] in fact the company farm referenced in various media outlets still run by family members lose it may be unaware that Noone as his parents spent time in both Iowa and California and on property in both locations although why any of this is relevant to Nunez it's unclear\nI Wonder if they looked at his high school yearbook yet the Fresno\nI Wonder if we should look at Nancy Pelosi's high school yearbook are we allowed to do that or Mazie Hirono can we look at her high school yearbook because she had won the Fresno Bee which\nIs well known for its anti newness crusades has reported isn't the aren't the media wonderful in this country\nNo they're not they suck\nHas reported on both the newness farms in Iowa and new noses farms in California just last August

operation previously run by noon as his grandfather no one is alleging the newness claimed to be running his own farm even if MSNBC mocks him as a former dairy farmer\nList that casually acknowledges that the secret quote unquote has been written about locally writing quote as far as I could tell until late August neither ... nor the local California press that covers and whatever publicly mentioned that his family dairy is no longer Tulare\nYou say leave this theory is that no one mentioned it because it's part of an elaborate conspiracy of silence\nAnd an explosive secret\nThe alternate theory is that no one mentioned it because few normal people give a damn where the congressman's parents live\nAnd it goes on I Wonder if he ever through any ice cubes I'd just wondering if
