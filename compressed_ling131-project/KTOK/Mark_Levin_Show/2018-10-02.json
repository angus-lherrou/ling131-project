power to make or break Kavanaugh and without settling on precise details they decided to use their leverage to insist on a process that would allow them to retake comfort level with Kavanaugh's confirmation process and seek more information rather than the killer Supreme Court nomination outright\nQuarter to two people familiar with the meeting that's two senators ...\nWhat resulted on friday afternoon through Washington and the chaos and guaranteed another week of uncertainty and suspend another week of character assassination and one way character assassination surrounding Kavanaugh's confirmation\nJust hours after flake endorsed cabin on seem to put him on a path to the high court the Arizona and said he first one of the week long FBI investigation into Ford's allegation\nThat the judge is all there was a victory\nFor Democrats who'd been demanding such a probe to no avail promises to define the retiring flakes legacy as someone who refused to let Kavanaugh get a vote while under a cloud of death but the flight led rebellion however long it lasts had been building for nearly two weeks\nThe Murkowski Collins mansion all endorse the FBI investigation on\nFriday flight needed another partner to pull off his move because none of them serves on the Judiciary Committee so flake just been mocked for writing a book the last thing the Trump presidency

moment the left onlookers increasingly bewildered as more senators\nJoined them in the back room there were ten minutes later with a deal that's forced Republican leaders to bounce other minorities demand for an FBI probe delaying the confirmation\nFor as much as a week I did not expect him to do this today Coons set of flake speaking for nearly everyone and official Washington\nSo legal insurrection points out flakes plot doesn't stop there it includes signaling the Senate Republicans that his intentions are not to bring down Kavanaugh it's unclear how true that is but here's political what continues\nAnd facts like was playing a longer again\nHe said his statements supporting cat when I was a signal to Republicans that he wasn't joining the Democratic resistance and would show he wasn't out the brink Kavanaugh's nomination down\nI hoped that would help provide leverage flake recounted but he needed some Democrats do indoors the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh's nomination to get fellow Republicans to agree ... wanted to demonstrate that the process is fair at least even if Democrats are not going to vote for Kavanaugh he added\nFlake wouldn't say whether the protesters played a role in his decision but he acknowledged he was in the middle of a remarkable moment ticked off his interactions with a lot of people on the phone email text walking around the capital you name it I Wonder if he spoke to the Duke lacrosse players\nIn his speech little noticed at the time ... suggested that someone with a partisan agenda might have leaked to the media Ford's letter alleging the assault harmonizing with what Republicans have been saying for days ... speech also repeated his request for an FBI investigation\nWas exactly what flake was looking for not long afterwards cones and flight repaired committee a ... anti room to hash out an agreement Democrats would endorse a one week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh\nInflated uses leveraging the narrowly

investigation you know why they do that to you\nSo you think there's actually a criminal investigation going on here against Kavanaugh that those\nAre real live criminal investigation now there's not\nThis has nothing to do with a criminal investigation I Will be honest with you I suggested to two senators\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee that Dr Ford why she doesn't walk into the Montgomery County police department and file a criminal complaint you know what the senators said to me Mr producer nothing they ignored me\n\nWell what if she does not\nWhat it is Ramirez does instead we get reporters we get get people giving their opinions we get this when I started the show with a real lot prosecutor\n\nWho sent a memo to the Republican senators laying out a huge list of in discrepancies of memory lapses of contradictions respecting\nDr Ford crickets\nNobody gives a damn before that she would try ... she's an incompetent incompetent my but she was great\nThese are

they dare not do it\nOr ms ... lawyer they dare not do\nIt or the rest\nThey dare not do it instead just keep them we need an FBI investigation isn't it interesting that the Three Stooges of the Republican Party Collins Murkowski\nAnd flake not one of them\nSaid you know I feel a lot better if she'd actually saw a you know filed a criminal complaint I Would have felt a lot better how come they didn't say\n'cause that that's why\nYou're here this now on Fox I'm short tonight somebody will bring it up some former prosecutor or whatever that's OK I'm used to this\nBut it's an important point\nHe said because in a court of law there's the cabinet does have the presumption of innocence and a quarter law there is due process and a quarter law if it's a criminal case it's beyond a reasonable doubt but as a prosecutor Rachel Mitchell set in her paper there's not even a preponderance of evidence here\nAnd I would add there's no evidence\n\nSo we have a circus we have the Roman

a coincidence really jot now they're sick go\n\nMother's sick I and go down the list are so called free media\nNot a free media on free media the way they cherry pick their stories they're partisanship it's obvious to everybody even the people who watch these these carbon footprint says CNN and MSNBC they know they're part is and that's why they watch 'em all twelve people\n\nBut I go back to my point I always have to say these things five times or so just to make sure even the media here me not a single\nAccuser has filed a criminal complaint with the statute of limitations would not have run and has not run in Montgomery County Maryland\nNot one and I'll tell you something else\n[noise] one of the reasons they think they can continue to say the most outrageous sickening insane things about Kavanaugh is they know he's a federal judge and they know he seeks to be on the Supreme Court so they know he will not sue them for defamation\n\nAnd if he sued Dr Ford for defamation she would lose\nEven on a public person standard she would lose she has no evidence\nIf he sued ms Ramirez she would lose if he sued Avon body and his crime they would lose you can accuse people of the most vital things with\nNo evidence with no witnesses it no corroborate ... it's a slam dunk\nNot might take a few years but they know he won't they know he can't given his interest and still being a Supreme Court justice and eventually if not returning to the uh staying on the DC circuit\nThese accusers and their lawyers and the Democrats in Congress fear the legal system the legal
