share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the Marco then show just picked up straight to the FBI place\nNow I'm right before the break mentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically\nOr over the course of my career it is the single most common question I have receipt and the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are you're not going to get anywhere and that's the problem they most\nPeople and this is true conservatives to buy the whites it's not like this is unique to liberals there are a lot\nWhat was that conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm gallon that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time but that\nIn other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable and Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you you just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you needed all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy\nSo if you want to be persuasive the first thing behind the white people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make just by lack unit because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nFor that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information\nThey're just going to view you as someone who is highly political trying to can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable\nOr is that they are analytical and that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way this surprises a lot of people but I find that common link there the millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on being legal to drink the youngest one's I'm the oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame them right along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment\nThey were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them and then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change that Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have

day and are getting set for an amazing weekend it certainly has been an emotional time and no doubt or we're going to have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point\nGiven that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nTo conform Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe Manchin Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I mean it's\nA ... it seems like it's inevitable at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe ... after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so ah the it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact something interesting that\nDeveloped out of Alaska Lisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa\nMurkowski voted no she didn't want to end debate and again if debate did not end today basically given I Would have been dead though to bring it right there at the procedural vote today\nAbsolutely critical to with her voting no uh you know she has come under heat from her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been going about not screaming not protesting not people that are chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office uh with phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been some pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have her way here the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions don't impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit ruling ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that would stand for all Alaskans seems like Lisa might now actually be reconsidering role is\nTaking a look at the most likely outcome here\nOr it looked like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today\nNow something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process is the positive that can be gained from all this how many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks\nHave known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know but they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus but didn't you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that line I mean one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabin on the ...\nOr ... that man what he has been through and and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nThat's ultimately what a think Brett Kavanaugh's role is two fold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged in paying attention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the big concerns of course has been well you know Trump's kind of Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce your kids to somebody\nThat seems to have all the ripe for priorities in the right place this is the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nA lot of folks have learned about how this than it actually works and that's important from a point of civic says well how delivered is the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until\nApproximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nYou know there are a lot of things about our government we complain about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by but they're always opportunities and we're in one of those moments one of those historical moment\nThen we can look back on and this could be an opportunity for a generation to learn what they never would have learned and have an opportunity and the time of adversity with leadership to point to somebody who does it the right way doesn't back down [noise]\nI'm Brian much we'll be right back\nI'm In for the gray one Marco them\nBut we had been incredibly incredibly consistent in our decision making a walk you back real quick to the presidential election twenty six thing\nI've done this for years for years are going back to the two thousand cycle but it was most notable and twenty sixteen when I was able to effectively and accurately depict Donald Trump winning the presidency\nBased upon the electoral college and the way I was able to do it is based upon historical trends\nSimply put you take a look at history back in a twenty six team we had a full term Democrat who was president\nThere has still to this point in American history never been a full term Democrat who was succeeded by an elected Democrat not ever\nAfter eight years we tend to have enough the only time it has ever happened many Democrats to see today full term Democrat was Truman after FDR he inherited the office yes he later ran as the incumbent and one\nBut because of that we tend to be incredibly consistent in all during the primary process\nEspecially here in Florida folks were asking me with Rubio running isn't Rubio more electable Trump's winning this can't be good this and that ... vote for the person you believe in because the odds are the Republican candidate what when\nAnd sure enough there you go now in the context mid term elections you're probably aware that the incumbent presidents party loses generally in fact there was only been three times three times since we had the two party system which started in the late Eighteen fifty is\nThat the incumbent presidents party has actually gained seats only three times and they each happened with an inflection point\nIn American history the first time was\nNineteen thirty for FDR was president we had the great depression\nThe second time Nineteen Ninety eight we had the bill Clinton\nBotched impeachment effort by Republicans\nFlex employ American history and then the next one came for years later two thousand to George W. Bush in the wake of nine eleven so it took the great depression nine eleven\nAnd the botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in mid term cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happened this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats and Republicans\nAre almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate maps favorable for them Heidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was likely to be a no vote\nAbout ten points about ten points where the what the difference in her race in North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia that voted yes Joe mansion by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on back of this\nYou know when I've been taking a look at for ... and how much this boat meant and those particular states\nAn average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump broke Kavanaugh states\nSo the Senate almost certainly going to say but still the house you take a lot of getting ... if you check any of the polls he checked decide to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are pacing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which would be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nAnd my question is and this is what I'm working out because again I base everything off of information are we at an inflection point in American history is this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this cabinet situation is that now I guess to what we went through and any of those other examples\nNot that Great Depression\nNot after nine eleven but if you're looking for a ... D absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight right there are so many similarities right now booming economy to what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was in Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton\nBut then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they've made him the issue right we've had the more investigation we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat would certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house that could be analogous you throw cabin on the mix maybe that is too\nSo this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance that Republicans really might gain in Congress this year\nIs this that moment in time then inflection point in American history where things are different historically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year\nBut there is an eight percent chance that they don't for a reason are we in that window will continue that conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud in for the great one month\nHim [noise]\nI Can't stress enough that you must protect yourself from thugs who steal personal information email address is Social Security numbers medical card passwords and retailers are being compromised every day you can't stay vulnerable it's why I switched to my id care the best in the business\nI I Do care coverage you for that nine types of identity theft providing best in class service and you can sign up at my\nId cared dot com slash mark my id care is taking care of fortune five hundred companies for years but just recently made their protection available to consumers Tom Kelly the c._e._o. is a genius it personal id protection plan start for less than ten bucks a month and only my\nId care offers a money back recovery guarantee my listeners also get Fifteen Percent off at my id cared dot com slash Mart learn more and then let my\nId care take care of you my id cares slash marks enter promos code mark that's my id care dot com slash\nIn great people that were a paid and and shouting that Joe Manchin it's going to win the hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd by the way I\nWant to give you a heads up on something that uh you definitely definitely should go ahead and ... on your DVR\nIf you don't already have a life liberty and lived in eastern Fox News channel Sunday night\nGoing to talk about the media and one of my all time face best in the business and your Mollie Hemingway from the federal is just going to be one of the guests on the show life wherever they lived in\nSunday night synagogue eastern Fox News channel are coming up we're going to continue this conversation gets some of your thoughts as well is this an inflection point I blame on the great one more call that we\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bond with one atom of oxygen boom you're just created nitric\nOxide a miracle molecule your own body makes that fuels your cardiovascular health keeping you vibrant but as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural nitric oxide\nSuper beach by human as harness the power of nutrient rich beach\nAnd created a super food that helps your body make more nitric oxide on its own one teaspoon of super beach daily support your cardiovascular health and blood pressure levels giving you a natural energy without\nThe need of a quick caffeine category sugar high we're talking real healthy natural energy caught eight six six to zero five for nine zero seven\nOr go to super beach dot com backslash Levin L.

[noise]\nSusan Collins had her find this moment in fact and I'm Still shocked by it the finest moment I think any United States Senate or is that at least that I\nHave witnessed still almost beyond belief\nOr if you did not catch Susan Collins her speech\nEarlier today it is definitely a must listen and watch it so I take it in for sure uh she really ended up uh laying the dam\nAnd uh want to get some of your thoughts so let's go to Neddy in Anchorage, Alaska and and then he understand that uh you're a you're a little higher on Lindsey than non Susan at this point\nWell just from the standpoint Brian of a senatorial moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it wasn't on the for the Senate then have all the trappings\nBut Lindsay lane those that are members on that Judiciary Committee either eat spinach okay from\nExactly what they need to hear I don't think they pay no attention to it but he took a stand in the heat of battle he didn't wait to see which way the wind was blowing that's kind of way I look at it and I think and I'm going to say that I'm\nBeing the never Trump or which Susan Collins was one where you can make ... was one and Jeff Flake was one I think that they had seen the attendance at Trump's rally they he's been they had four or five I've lost count he's like Energizer Bunny\n[laughter] they they and enthusiasm in those rallies when President Trump was mentioned cabin I now I\nAm sure you heard that too um and so I just I I think Collins for her speech today but I really wanted to say how much I admire Lindsey Graham for really having a party in there to\nReally say what needed to be said to those members of that condition the committee that were acting\nUh well they are they all have their Spartacus moment I think [laughter]\nBut but actually something you can be proud of but you know I Would agree with you as a probably Lindsey Graham's by this moment as well are you talking about the the five o'clock hour five o'clock ... eastern time tomorrow we're going to have this vote\nAnd it was ... o'clock eastern time but Lindsey Graham a week ago yesterday ended up by having that particular moment where it's better now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be\nPragmatic yet emotional plenty of Lindsey Graham ah but ah but ultimately I'm not going to take anything away from him it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take a given that you are in Alaska\nSo she voted no today the heat is being put on her ultimately what are the implications in Alaska does she have a chance to uh to win her next election if she ended up going down this path\n[noise] well I I Wish I Know that cancer that Brian judging from the very popular radio show in the afternoon for three to fix up here I ever had most every day and believe me the people I Can't remember very many call Raymond one hand for foreign Lisa\nAll the other calls have been um\nUm we hope she vote for a ... a cabinet [noise]\nOkay it's going to be interesting to see what happens there I actually think there's an outside chance that she ends up becoming a boat in the affirmative tomorrow or I Know that the earlier today a in addition to her voting no to end debate she also indicated that he wasn't the right person at the right time for this country\nBut then she walked back through comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so uh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although what should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and early summer camp\nIn and vote in the apartment it because it's not going to alter the outcome almost certainly tomorrow All right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater, Florida Dan welcome to the show\nHey thank you sir [noise]\nHey I'm I was watching and listening to a center calling speech today and at first I was I was stunned I was amazed I was impressed and the part when her speech I started going\nThis damage control and I started going wow I mean the American public and importantly to the Democrats the independents are getting angry and they need to lessen the damage and they do run damage control they lessened the damage to them that's what I saw I think it actually hurts her speech was scripted\nShe did not speak like the cortex was written\nSo I don't I don't think that that was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to you know take the anger directed that they righteously have towards them and less than\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest convicted gifts\nBut what you don't hear about\nFolks that sacrifice

where they stand\nOne of their ah major endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron disadvantage for governor for years after endorsing Democrat right\nLikes or from the story a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently using demographic that is a serving now the saint Pete area but uh anyway well it's about time he actually was a Republican governor and in Florida\nRubio ran him out of the party what happened anyway I'm\nContinuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement at the same answers the PBA president said dissent is would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies\nQuote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell for the ... that Iran does say that this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the for the PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years some of the quote\nFrom the president of the border police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boil boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to\nThis hose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for this unsettled he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI'd call myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mother said their children in the car\nBut you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over and part of what made me so upset I noticed what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look and and I was tracking violence towards police officers remember before the whole Kaepernick\nThing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them at all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country and I notice that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida\nThat tracks the violence against police officers\nAnd here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he didn't offer examples have ... scrutiny of police has resulted in place being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance\nBut here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three to say last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed three forty\nKilled and\nUntil this week\nWe had ... and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and forward about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers dine line of duty in Florida than any other state in the country but this is how bad it is and yes this is specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in the police being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups by media\nBy politicians and it's exactly why I started a series that I did a couple of years ago\nAnd in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now been put in that position yeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop get ... get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and tell me you're not going to find a\nBad apple but almost every one of all good people to put their lives on the line every single day for us and it is our responsibility now more than ever to back the badge and spread the word\nIs not getting better it's getting worse where this kind of crap that's going on and media if we don't want to have good folks don't want to be police officers that put on the badge to leave their families and by the way just this year\nWe had Seventy widows Seventy widows Seventy people that have lost their spouse\nAnd the line of duty we've got more than a hundred children that have lost a parent\nIn the line of duty stories are never told\nBut if we don't have great folks to pick up that badge to put it on the field that helped hold that fill that void the rest of the matter\nAnd that's the other way the left is systematically chewing through our society to support your police back them it's about a hell of a lot more than politics um by mud in for the great one\nHim [noise]\nListen to what David aspirin Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done ... absolutely right I truly love my ex chair and I know you will to trust me why don't you feel
