California eight Seventy the answer to go right ahead\nA marker first I've got to tell you that my wife and I love your TV show which the best thing on TV\nThank you thank you well Sunday it's back ten pm the way it should be eastern and where you are seven PM\nAnd and we actually missed you last Sunday because of the time change although I've got it set up said\nOn Saturday So am I doing this year this morning I just want to suggest one thing about senators I'm Murkowski and columns and like\nI have a feeling that they are going to vote for a Kavanaugh and they've already made up my their minds but by not focusing their hand at this point the Republicans are putting maximum pressure\nOn voters Democrats\nRunning for the Senate\nIn states that Trump won\nYou know this makes a ton of sense assuming Collins and slate and Murkowski are playing ball you think they're playing ball\nI think that they are of bugs wife's they looked at the report and flake in college I think are on record saying\n... this is a definitive report this is a good deal depth investigation\nI'm On board I think that they're not backing away from that now there we merely letting mansion and the rest of these Democrats who would like to have it both ways they're letting them sit on the hot like\nIt must just be mentioned cause high camp already announced from North Dakota she's voting against him and so did the guy Donnelly in Indiana some mansions for the last one left\nAt they are voting or she at least is voting contrary to the will of her own constituency\n[noise] All right my friend that's fascinating I Hope you're right and I appreciate it Mike east Brunswick New Jersey the great WABC go right ahead\nYeah mark thanks for taking my call I'd like to talk about my new favorite senator Amy car I Believe is right I watched the most amazing thing she begins by practitioners out\nFor eight years just with county prosecutor and about how she knows about these things and then goes on to say that under our federal rules of evidence that for must be considered\nRadical because what she said to her therapist\nYeah cup search he's probably talking about ... to ... to here say will which only me that it can be it's reliable but she said it not reliable that is true but this person claiming expertise would get in front of the American\nPublic and make such a crazy statement\nYou're so right there and read the Koran out on it\nAnd by the way why doesn't she released those therapists notes we'd all like to look at them now that she waived any sort of privilege\nYeah well that's the next thing it's a pretty remarkable if somebody they tried to go here said well that's a person you want to me if you put the whole thing but it's it's really crazy that's comparable with confidence that some of these um am a critic senator show\nThat you're a lawyer I think it well yeah but I don't do a hell of a lot of try work but even idols I write a it doesn't make her credible it just means that it's ... she got it and how somebody in that position cannot do the difference is just remarkable\nAll right Mike good caught appreciate it John Fayetteville, Arkansas the great K. F. A. Y. go\nMy brother what up\nCome on down to picture of a ... a church or your fault you know the guy\nThat had been torn down that statue you\nKnow no more black people you know Democrats bill corners I Love your ... oh yeah Clinton's ... listen mark you know I'm I'm real quick I get off somebody got bike listen\nThese senators and say oh it's a lifetime position look you've been on the on the

calling landmark or the ferry what we do more in November we broke the small town in middle America coming at you because those are the bottom left coast and the and the east coast\n\n\n\n\n\nNow during the confirmation process I met was sixty five senators and explain my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced vile and violent threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement in response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character\nMy statement and the answer is also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\n[noise] I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been\nI might have been too emotional at times I don't know that might tone was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a son has been in that I testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge a person I had been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lead against the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed and will continue to be the same kind of judge I been for the last twelve years and I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach volunteer and teacher\nEvery day I Will try to be the best husband died and friend I can be I Will remain optimistic on the sunrise side of them out and I will continue to see the day that is coming that the day that has gone\nI reviewed the constitution I Believe that it independent and impartial judicious raised a central direct constitutional republic\nIf confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court I Will keep an open mind in every case and always strive to preserve the constitution of the United states and the American rule of law Brett Kavanaugh\nTo beautiful up it won't matter one way to the Democrats or the media and the three Republican stooges are really wanting their own careers and positioning themselves and don't give a wet about judge Kavanaugh his wife his kids or his\nParents [noise] [noise] oh several times to judge mentions in this op ed the constitution and therein lies his problem\n\nThe reason these hated by the less the reason is under attack by the Democrats [noise] the reason the media went would gossip and rumor\nAnd really defamation is because his declared support for the constitution they do not support they do not support the constitution except for take the free press part because they think it protects that\n[noise] but when it comes to the constitution they trash constitutional originalists and texture lists were throwback stops you know unless we embrace the progressive agenda and then trying it\nAs a constitutional matter there by rewriting the constitution with nearly five justices\nThan we injustice Kavanaugh must be destroyed it is the constitution that gets in the way of the progressive agenda don't you say\nIt's the constitution that they despise\nThey make no sense whatsoever when they talk about the constitution when they talk about precedent when they talk about precedent we know I suppose that they must embrace Dred Scott they must ... plus and they must embrace Korematsu that's precedent\nIt's precedent that was rejected as precedent the case that Dred Scott it took a civil war to undo it the case of plus it took fifty eight years to undo it\nCase Korematsu it still hasn't been done\nThose were activists judges who did not follow the constitution of the United states\nThat's why this is an important debate\nThey insist on abortion it's not in the constitution so they demand precedent they insist on their entire social agenda there environmental agenda it's not in the constitution but they demand they insisted on all powerful centralized government to advance their agenda\nThat's not in the constitution either and they insist that the individual in states\nWell that they accept this new rewritten constitution despite the fact that you and I have never participated in amending it\nIt's big cars judge Kavanaugh\nHere's the constitution not just a name but an action as he declares that he is despise and he is hated because it's a threat to the progressive agenda\nSo the more he talks about reverence for the constitution the more he talks about following the constitution the more he is despised I'll be right back\nIn ...\nOklahoma City help wanted uncompromising so world's worst boss but one of those jobs on huge

look\nI think a healthy vibrant Christian a face of people have Christian faith like healthy vibrant people of Judaism is a good thing for this country and a good thing for the world whether you say\nIt couldn't be better state and I mean we as I mentioned injury to reiterate what I said before\nWe we stand then would fight to the death to protect the rights\nOf liberty for everyone not just ourselves it's not a self interest thing it is what is it we're going from the bottom our hearts that everyone ought to be free everyone is banned in God's image everyone has an alien I'm All right in this country to liberty\nAnd we do Dale Jews and Christians have such a healthy attitude toward a morality and toward God\nAnd we we share the same absolute values and these values guide us and govern our society and our entire a constitutional framework is based on those values and no other country in the history of the world even comes close to the principles that under this\nA constitutional republic there were some great empires but they were empires America's not even an empire and as if the most powerful nation and the history of the world that could have dominated and taking over the world but it has been benign is\nDone shoplift and not self worth that his work is looked at its own self interest but it it's not sought to conquer other nations and exploit other nations contrary to the to the left\nA history revision as a uh in every respect most both the master plan for a our religious principles are what stand behind things that make this country great\nTo tell you something and I've been reading through your book and it is fascinating to me as a non Christian um you write beautifully you write in a way that's totally understand well these are very complicated subjects you know you can get really way down\nOr you can get caught in the weeds and you don't do any of that\nUh and uh and and\nYou can see the uh the decency and you're right\nNow getting back to the world the courts a first of all I forgot there was such a thing secondly is there do they have any teeth at all where they can force the United states to do anything\nWell it's interesting because the international court of justice rulings are binding but they have no enforcement mechanism\nA and in addition it ran out through this whole argument argued that the sanctions were the violation of Nineteen fifty five treaty between the United states and Iran called the treaty of amity\nAnd as a result the first thing the United states that yesterday was terminate that treaty ah so ah\nThat treaty is no longer in effect so I guess the United states can now say a their argument is no longer valid but in any event lay a there is nothing to enforce\nThis action by the court meaning the United states could just continue on with the sanctions and if there were ... were to be more pursuit of this case through the international court uh it would probably take years\nAnd I gather that's what the president if he's even thought that deeply into it is counting on I don't think he's thinking that deep I think he's thinking about all the good things we do for Saudi Arabia and he wants to favor and return\nYeah and there are also some reports out there that Saudi Arabia and if you can believe it or leave Russia\nHave agreed to increase their output Russia is the number one oil producer in the world about non OPEC member a but does that ... that's been kept under wraps a little bit with Saudi Arabia and Russia basically saying look we're asked about this we're going to deny it but it

and the next couple of days\n[noise] [noise] well I ... the course of the oil sanctions won't go in for another month okay uh but uh other sanctions or are these sanctions are already in effect Iran's wanted to have all sanctions removed\nBut what the court said his will remove sanctions that have a link to humanitarian issues\nYou could make an argument that any sanction has a link to humanitarian issues but they're talking about a medical supplies and medicines and food and agriculture equipment as well so that's where we are right now a ... so I mean the sanctions will remain United States
