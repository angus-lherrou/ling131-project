this the a prime minister of ah Canada\nTrudeau young Trudeau chip off the old man's block Trudeau has set in the past say we we uh welcome aliens illegal aliens I guess he calls them undocumented migrants\nFrom all parts of the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all this stuff a\nSolution for the illegal aliens who are trying to come into the country illegally a solution for the Trump Administration and the solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do\n[noise] president United States picks up the phone and he calls Trudeau and he says hey we got seven to fourteen thousand people coming here legally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you've said you're very compassionate about these things so here's what we're going to do when I get a whole bunch of greyhound\nBuses and\nGoing to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible get on the buses and we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico\nDoes it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico oh we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on greyhound buses and will drive them tour northern border and won't let them out because Canada wants to them\nPeople want to leave they ... they come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume they're how ...\nEven though they're carrying their flags and in the United states\nThis president believes in law and order and enforcing immigration laws so there you have your satisfy all three the illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving there how halls Canada receives them because our arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea Mr but\nIt is and on top of that\nLook at greyhound greyhound makes a profit to they could probably use\nSo that's my solution ladies and gentlemen for the caravan ha a parade of illegal immigrants who were coming into our country supported by left wing groups south of the border left wing groups within the United states\nFunding organizations within our borders funding organizations outside our borders like in Venezuela and so forth\nBut here we can accommodate everybody\nOK well use ... to I don't care what can you ... you can use taxis greyhound whatever\nI'm not particular about these things [noise] what Mr producer my\nCall screeners

supporters of a particular candidate have been directly account of attacked and attacked regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things to people when they when they pick the side and then there are five\nAnd ... that's my point is you know they formed back and forth that it's a it's the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it it's still a threat to to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something to the supporters of the Democrats the way that the Democrat\nArm burglaries and so for that we actually to believe\n\nThat the political rhetoric causes these things I mean seriously ladies and gentlemen this guy has a a long crime record including threatening to use a bomb in two thousand to multiple felonies\n\nAnd we get played all the time by the media really by the left more more more generally played all the time well if the president we keep them as rent has nothing to do with the president then as I pointed out in exquisite detail for the last forty eight hours\nIt's the president who's called Hitler it's the president who's called a Nazi it's his supporters us who are called neo\nNazis
