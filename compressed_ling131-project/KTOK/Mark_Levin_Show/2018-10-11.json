angry left wing mob mob since the middle of his campaign or they\nReally the leadership of the Democratic party actually do believe that you are the most dangerous\nThere's people in this country because you're calling them out on their agenda you're actually keeping them from power and now they think that they could intimidate you they actually think that they can bully their way into office

activities that we're seeing right now the disruption that we're seeing right now in our society the Senate cannot function this way our government can't function this way our country can't function the way they could have done that\nBut they didn't they actually encourage it they this is their base they have decided that there is more power aligning themselves with the mob right now than in condemning the mob\nThat's about all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the comedians they got there because members of the Senate gave them tickets to get in\nThey knew what was going to happen they are accessories to the crime that we're seeing going on right now and and to make it even worse instead of condemning the mob there condemning you for calling it a mob\nYou're using coded language the your weapon I think the word against them well hell yes we are you're lucky that's the only weapon than that it's being used\nWe will weaponize that word we will paint your party as the mob and the streets until you step up and condemn the mob only then can we actually have a civil

Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate even if no senator as opposed to understand\nThis but Democrats\nCare about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey bus or clerk to run the environment and natural resources division of the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed to come to the floor for a vote\nSay that every single one of the nominees the Trump has put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the best with you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy\nHe was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a year we had no one bastard or Germany and once he got there\nBoy he is is ... and then into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran in Germany\nAnd all these other businesses and banks and industry suddenly doing business with the terrorists mullahs Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get Rick right now as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from Iran all we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that's what Trump one way that it's because they didn't have as an Basset are there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats filed cloture this is a Senate rule that can be changed in should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator Foust cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate and I think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now there languishing\nFor each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\n\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just halt progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to muck up the works they just want a slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nThe going back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's\nSo here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what are the Republicans do during Obama's first two years ... wells\n\nYou don't hear about this in the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirm more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign sci fi now McConnell starting to instead of just saying screw it we're done with this rule which he could do\nInstead he's now saying hey it's a nice mid term election coming up in twenty seven days be a shame if you couldn't go back to your state to campaign\nAide Joe Manchin I Know it's it's not a long drive to West Virginia from D.

like to go there and press the flesh and hand out some walking around money to the voters in St Louis not going to be able to do it if you're forced here to vote on all these nominees so McConnell's playing hardball now and he said you guys want to go back we got to make a deal on these things\n[noise]\nUh let's hope Republicans extract the high price for that privilege some one day I hear it is
