United states you never got stuff like that for Bush\nDidn't want to get that from anybody else just straight trial it's right there and boom that was President Trump putting out a video about the

also pushing for is their broad\nAlready and some odd Andrew Gillum running for governor in Florida on a platform of attempting to impeach the president and Medicare for all it's a fraud\nAnd if you happen to miss an conversation brought a here's the Reader's Digest version right now you got Fifteen Percent of the U.S population on Medicare Fifteen Percent All right you didn't know how many people pay into it you Oregon okay you're paying into it\nNow Fifteen Percent or ... on it everybody working paying into it and we are set for insolvency in eight years eight years twenty twenty six and by the way it does that mean talking not or some kinda kooky right we map from\nFrom stuff that comes from the trustee the trustee Medicare is the after the or not so Affordable Care act was passed and you have the Democrats that deeper into Medicare money we went from seeing a Medicare begin insolvency in the twenties thirties to well\nTwenty twenty six so we're just eight years away from Medicare saying uh yeah you know one nine percent of the benefits year one are going to go away and it gets worse from there now you have the president United States has not ... afraid to say it's a fraud\nSo for all the people that go yeah you know I was just over there smoking some dope and Elizabeth Warren is making a lot of sense right now for that person\nHey\nMake sure they don't

were Swiss Tennessee values are about is fake as I don't know Elizabeth Warren's Native American roots but I digress because I was telling you about the Medicare for all fraud again Fifteen Percent of people on it\nEverybody working paying into it what do you think happens if we put a hundred percent of people on it\nHow's that work since this thing already doesn't work and twenty twenty six\nOr

particular\nInterview but something has happened over the last several days that led me to go ahead and do something a little bit early wouldn't usually do this until after the general election one because it's kind of annoying to me it's like\n... the point of which were not even into September and you're going to the store and the Halloween stuff is all rubbing up against the Christmas like seriously at all now little space oh distance it's not necessary not yet right\nCan we not get through the mid term election before it's about twenty twenty I mean is there are so dumb because you have really did twenty twenty election that started during the Kavanaugh hearings because\nRemember the only reason we have Spartacus was because of twenty twenty oh I Am about for a gaffe and all

some majority that is so you here you have Spartacus marching into I Want to test the waters over the weekend I mean seriously yeah Kamala Harris holding her nose and leaving California to go to the south she went to South Carolina\nI imagine how painful that is for her\nAnd of course why do we have to be the test the Native American ancestry test by one\nRefer to occasionally as Elizabeth Warren a really bad Pocahontas or it's ultimately because she's also running now for twenty twenty she might have just taken herself out of it we we shall see although who knows and democratic ranks just might be a rambling gal\nBut because all of this is going on and you even have the president of the United states being asked about twenty twenty on a near daily basis I feel the need to tell you this president Donald Trump will likely be reelected\n... ... ... ... ... he's reelected now\nBefore you just sit there and what I thought it was pretty by ... you know it's not even anything to do with the economy is not anything to do with\nAll the record improvements so we've been saying here's the first reason why the odds are in his favor he's an incumbent president running for reelection so let's start their sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election win and\nIn order not to when you have to be as lame is kept in the not the aforementioned Jimmy Carter or you have to do something like read my lips no new\nTaxes and then raise taxes make it yourself Ross Perot and it splits about\nComing up I Will give you a little bit of the background about that sixty five percent and we'll get into someone's going to Saudi Arabia as well it is a it's festive we we have a lot to talk about we're just getting warmed up I Am by mud in for the great one more glove is\n\n\nThat now look back at this week in history\nThis week and they seem sixty seven in the U.S formally ... of Alaska\nAfter purchasing the territory from Russia for seven point two million dollars for less than

thousands of people lined up outside the bizarrely shaved white concrete buildings\nThat resembles a giant upside down cupcake was opening day at the Guggenheim Museum home to one of the world stops

six boys want to\nGo love condemnation nine Lisa like Sarah Stock news President Trump warning of a rush to judgment when it comes to the disappearance of journalist you mall 'cause she'll be at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul it's evidence now that the Saudis had something to do with it\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left there just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours oh he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who would never be reelected when people already see the mistake\nTo me like you you really just do not get it the first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at what it would take for someone who voted\nFor that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you can move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and from info you're interested to know how Fordham has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yeah I was up for it it did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nAt since the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past two years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way probably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people go without registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology left our\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so if that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and ... is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst ... you you take a look at the economy we have the best economy and the generation I never faulted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap they didn't know better they went through school here in front of a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment\nThey get out there and go yeah this really does suck they hear Obama and they go with I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you've got some lines that are up and\nThat's the gun in the in the generation but we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way record unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men\nYeah remember how it's all about the white men white man\nIn Asia and the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment\nRight out oh by the way but\nYou also have the biggest increase in the take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there is a little math\nAnd it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary than the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right\nThen you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent and then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts\nHappens to be for the average fulltime employee person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I think they benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments to if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government in interest free one but\nIt's still there because of well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably has attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected in twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often were we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem\nYou take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically oh these are angry white men that are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one folks on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration gets what\nDoesn't make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd the foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've released kept to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is\nHas been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped toward the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott's\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration say that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow material now that's where this whole situation with hey we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own that goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some ah folks from uh the the Saudi regime that enter\nAnd a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bond bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it\nAnd it's important to know who in what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said uh I'm going to bring it back up you're on the other side I Am Brian mud and for the great one month\nHim [noise]\nAsk any a Mac member what they like most

Saudi Arabia [noise] you know\nWe deal with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended they have nothing but contempt for us would you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the ... and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS has painted your country and painted themselves\nIt's kinda like Lindsey Graham did his version of coming out isn't it\nEver since the ... thing it's been a whole new Lindsey Graham and he's\nHe's out these loving every minute of it I mean this is enjoyable for him major sanctioned the hell out of the old dodgy boring and Lindsey Graham\nAnyway a in this particular case that's what makes me nervous and it's what makes me not just the the idea section the hell out of okay well what happens for example of Saudi Arabia says you know what\nI Know we had kind of been with you on Israel and against Iran but uh you know when we're feeling quite as as cordial as we had previously\nWhat happens\nAnd what happens if they say you know what we're just gonna go ahead and turn off this begin to do back and see what happens to oil prices and see if we can do something that a wreck the economy a little bit therefore you know President's Day\nAnd things that that could happen any number of different application so I think it's easy for Lindsey Graham who's out there and loving every\nOf it and join this newfound freedom maybe being the person you always wanted to be that he finally feel that at the speed is kinda fascinating if you think about it and I I digress here you have Lindsey Graham is like oh what can I came out maybe said things that it would that have always meant to be sane\nAnd people did\nYou know you're talking about the Trump effect I mean it would take a look at it and the Republican Party Mitch McConnell got an incredible reception in Kentucky the other night I mean what does that ever happen\n[laughter] I mean\nIt's an interesting day these people clearly enjoying this this newfound freedom and the Trump effect that has come over them\nBut it's complicated it's complicated so I don't know but now let's just go sanction the hell out of all that's the best answer and I'm not sure that we're necessarily going to find our our friend ah who uh is mysteriously well where exactly Jamal is talking\nLet's go to Aaron in Kansas Erin go\nOh just a quick question if sucking denies any knowledge of it or not it was a body it's obvious that he's not in the counseling anymore give\nUs a body this poor guys in a hole somewhere still being tortured\nYou know it's an interesting thought a if you were going to be really uh I don't know a ... if you're going to engage in in a war game I mean I I suppose you could end up putting up any number of Syria it scenarios than the least of which would be well maybe when you how the Saudi officials leave\nThe consulate they left with them\nYou know if you were there there are any number of things that can happen I'm not sure that it would make sense for him to remain there and be tortured because well you are and how many more potential witnesses add a lot more difficult situation for even turkey to account for at that point so\nOf all the scenarios that two weeks later he's still there will be tortured I think would be among the least likely but hey do your point anything could be possible\nAppreciate the call now but talking about the\nOddities the oddities politically and and some of the assumptions that often or not

Fox News President Trump calling in another case of guilty until proven innocent\nNot wanna hold oh by the way small details\nOh get there I I couldn't help by itself but to put together some information on Taylor Swift and on the race that she endorsed and her clear lack of understanding of any of it\nWhen I ended up reading this was the headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC ... Taylor Swift political Dorfman could become the biggest red\nEver at the polls Everest appalled [laughter]\nI mean OK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought\nHere's an actor last week pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking or stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nThe effect of Swiss surprise endorsement which was made the on Instagram post were felt right away as thousands of people between\nThe ages of Eighteen to twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\nOkay now\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some\nMedia recently has a couple of days ago we're still my gosh it's happening I think it's quite a down a little bit over the past the hour or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey so he was up in Tennessee or\nSee I'm Taylor ... specific endorsement of the Democrat Bill Britain sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nSheila's averaging that three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee right Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race is now nine points\nSo\nOh not exactly what you're probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighed in on\nIs negative six percent in a week so I like to say you got two sides to stories in one side the facts but here's the deal you got a lot of folks that are going to the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction rent or science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing I'm In the south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in and specifically when she ended up outing herself\nPretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSaid if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons among others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values\nBut you see here is that the the dirty little details\nTaylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania huh and she happened only moved\nTo Tennessee to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there are less than half her life\nYou know in the you know Taylor Swift this tendency values as say a Elizabeth Warren is too too Cherokee Indians you know the the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas smelling now\nShe spoke of supporting el ... writes\nGB T rights as part of her Tennessee value is by the way [noise] I guess what the Democrats the she endorsed\nBill Bratton said he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the record as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in no go\n\nAnd then you got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in Nashville better\nYeah but here's the thing anybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who\nDoes not support gay marriage and host of other old GB T rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania\nSo she's endorsing in the old white guy bad evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\nI mean and there was a lot more we we can continue down that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those into the state they pretty much get the point to and you get along you log\nIn terms of Tennessee values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't dissipating I mean come on\nAll the celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm either way it wasn't an awkward moment\nI mean I did the trick always does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see if she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nTendency L. J. B. T. writes values\nShe could actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that some Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nOberlin phrased endorsement really did encourage an additional ... million people largely black do vote for broad Obama over Hillary Clinton\nSo it's only Taylor Swift had to wait in Pennsylvania\nAlgae B. T. Tennessee values maybe she wouldn't have ended up with an old white guy who doesn't support gay marriage or the algae Beatty rights that made her look like she is as clueless as she actually is that she could have had somebody that\nYou know it was going to shake it off do whatever it is that she does these days but nice try Taylor nice try and find a way by the way as for tendency values part of the reason why you have the Democrat Bill Britain's and that is not supportive of those things\nEighty one percent of tennis fans are Christians fifty two percent of the evangelical variety\nOh by the way you might want to at least investigate the state that you claim to be from that you represent the values off saying\nTwo sides to stories one side effects anyway uh we're we're just getting warmed up this hour Brian ... in for the great one month\nHim ...\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect the optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them after my got the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat and see status currently\nNot collectible that's a big win because it basically says no use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here optimal kept finding on Nathaniel spy happen till the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands of resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolve over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the IRS call my friends that optimism tax relief\nEight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred\nEight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred that's eight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred\n... many more hot rods muscle cars timeless classics and more goes assigned Oklahoma fill up those engines the cars for a cause car show presented by seven eleven the benefits of muscular dystrophy association will take place Saturday October twenty of Twin Peaks on forty and okay see re register your local seven eleven\nFor online and WWW dot NBA dot org slash cars for a cause for more information call the MBA and four oh five seven to two thousand one\nTuesday October ...

it's not like we had a somebody who went in and hunted down Republicans at a baseball field or anything\nOh wait we [noise] gee\nIt's almost it's almost like it's imbedded in many of these that Democrats\nYeah just the peace and love the open mindedness it's all there for you all there you can feel the ... ... ... why wouldn't you want to be part of that by the way so I'm saying oh let's go to Joe in Jersey Joe go\nHey Brian how are you oh good for\nA while I was waiting for you I just thought of something an extension to what I Want to talk about with what you were just touching on but um\nThis is Taylor Swift thing could be even a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being anybody of any value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on the night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen and Tom Petty were they were pounding the war drums the recall that\nNot really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a\nIt was all in a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at you but they're the same they were covering the same cloth especially Springsteen were they were anti war a it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping to God that people are just not taken serious anymore\nBut I can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there's some places where the celebrities do play if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in fact there is research that did show up from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talk about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell the the first thing is you've got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody who's close minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard you try not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say this yeah I'm not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of the judgment until I was sixteen made that kind of thing didn't come up where where it was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania\n[laughter] name they drew many of the folks in Tennessee at those people and so it's kinda like I Know you and in in Jersey Joe but I mean the you know Jersey or not not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kind of cut in half you know are almost at the center of the state\nUm for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know the more conservative area but I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my ...\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are ... really have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is then irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know I just ah\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will of I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really you you got some work to New Jersey oh let's go to a liberal land in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota ailing\nOh I Do not liberal I have always been on both sides of the fence and honestly with the tenth and sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back and let you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short\nMan we're talking to Michael power on news radio downs and Katie okay and then I also see a report that this uh this dismembered this alleged dismembered ... may have happened I mean not to get rid of the body but as a means of actual torture\n[noise] it's very possible there are reports coming out that I'm there first of all what the Turkish police have\nFound according to them and according to some of the leaks that we are getting here is this an eleven amended audiotape depicting the death and just never been up to shop now whether or not he was alive when that happened or dead when that happened is still a little unclear we're hitting conflicting reports but the tape does exist and let them in a tape according to the Turkish officials\nIs not one that was recorded by ... on his apple watch this is something completely independent of that they got this from someplace else and according to the wall Street Journal they're saying that can show he was killed as soon as he walked into the consulate according to the tape that they heard\nOr as soon as he walked in he was killed and then dismembered from there there was no\nUm interrogation that was back up or that somebody went a little crazy during they didn't even get to that point it was just killed in December from there\nI'd according to Saudi Arabia according to Turkish officials one of the gentleman that they recognize the voice on in this entire situation was a Saudi forensics expert who have been told that men in the room to listen to music because he was about to dismembered body\nSo some put on some tunes yeah man I don't know what\nYou listen to that point and not sure what what round out those sounds and you have to believe ... years from but on some level he made the suggestion for that\nSo do we think this was the Saudi king or was this one of the princes who did this\nThat's a great question that's kind of where they're trying to figure things out right now according to Turkish officials they found a that there were Fifteen members of the Saudi group that came into town to David this all went down\nOf the people that they recognize there is the one that I mentioned earlier in regards to the Saudi forensics expert but then there was another guy on there\nThat they identified as not only a a a close relation to the prints on some level and high ranking officer in the Saudi general intelligence presidency but somebody who with regularity operate as sort of Secret Service if you will for the king so we don't know exactly what those details are I think that's something\nThat the Turks have collected during their investigation who they can recognize and passports that they've seen coming in identifying that back to what kind of proximity to the king it's kind of yet to be seen at this point\nAnd I imagine there's going to be even if they do a bit trace it to the royal family of Saudi Arabia there'll be enough plausible deniability enough layers to insulate them from whatever happened news for anyone thousand Katie Okay Michael ... thanks for joining us live
