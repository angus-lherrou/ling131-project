{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "I just don't like I'm complaining but ... you and I are in the same kind of business I'm In the news business and I need to know what's going on twenty four seven it honestly does get exhausted after a while and I think for me the pinnacle was about two Thanksgivings ago\nI was at the Thanksgiving with my family and a dear elderly aunt of mine was outraged at President Obama everything you said and did and she was constantly asking me\nWhat did he say about this what do you think about that and finally I turned off my cell phone and I looked across interested and be we're going to be in a news free zone for the next twenty four hours we're not going to know what's going on or what Obama said or did or did anything\nAnd that was so liberating for me I Try to do that at least once a week\nYou have to because the amount of information that flooding us is not healthy\n... you know it used to be that you would read you know and my dad tells me stories all the time he says I used to wake up and read the morning newspaper you know I have my cup of coffee I'd go about my day than I Would check in with the evening news and I go to sleep it wasn't this constant stream of information all day long people went to work and\nThey did their jobs they weren't constantly plugged in they weren't getting news alerts on a phone I mean some people have multiple emails they have their home email they have their work email they have some people have multiple devices a of a personal phone work phone\nAnd just combine all of that with then the tax thing and then the personally now and then people actually picking up the phone and calling you which I Do I Do know is rare but also does happen\nSo and I I empathize you know people in the news is I'm In the news business as well but I I Do the same thing on the weekends unless there is you know the Kavanaugh hearings obviously had me very plugged in unless there is something that has come very pressing or I happened to that we'd be hosting on the weekend\nI take those weekends for myself for me and my husband we we live real life we go outside I take hours at a time where I Will put the phone away because the news is still going to be there when you get back and the truth of the matter is that you you can really as long as\nYou have to talk yourself through it at first but you really will survive if you take four or five hours and you will wind up looking back and saying wow\nYou know those four or five hours were well spent whereas if you're sitting on that phone you could waste\nSix hours you could get through Twitter news links Facebook Instagram taxing emails and then you're like you're sitting in the same position for six hours like I haven't even boat you forget to eat sometimes because your self\nPlugged in you're doing so many things hours go by you hadn't had any water you at you're not taking care of your body so it's incumbent upon us I think especially people who are around children I Would say to see that and they they are going to turn into that and they don't have the benefit of having years\nBefore them in the path and in their formative years where they didn't have all this stuff that was you know flooding their life we have that we we grew up and we didn't have to deal with all that said you know seven eight nine ten years old\nYou know it's only three years old or getting handed devices like hey here's your device\nI had enough distractions anyway I Can't imagine growing up with all this technology not yet forget about\nThat but even if you know people who have kids that are in high school and college and they're dating\nThat dating well for that I mean everything happens over a text message none of these kids are growing up learning how to communicate face to face because they don't have to they're not learning that eye contact is important they are going on college job interviews and I know I used to teach high school students there they don't know how to do that because they're like we have to look somebody in the I Am uncomfortable with that I don't\nThey don't have the confidence that comes from years of having those conversations face to face and learning how to navigate them and they're awkward for everybody at first\nBut that's how you turn into an adult they're not having those experiences and the truth is if they see you on your phone all the time they're gonna do it to say well why do I have to take time away from the phone if mom or dad or the teacher is on their phone all the time so we have to be mindful that as well\nGender Diaa below you know her from a Fox has out numbered in the five also the view the name of the book is has to do not disturb how I'd go stood my cell phone to take back my life and ... out of the book is available everywhere\nIt is you can get at Barnes and noble you can get an Amazon dot com and I also did an audio book and people keep asking me did you read the whole audio book or just enter out read the whole thing so it's all in my voice is a lot of personal stories in there that were heart to heart for me that I wanted really to people to to be able to feel how passionate I was about this this is my passion project and I\nI really hope people you know take the time and realize it's not a judgmental book it's not a book on saying oh you're doing this wrong and I did it right it's a book round thing I did this wrong\nYou may be doing it wrong you may not share with me in this journey and maybe discover something about yourself and here's what I did it make my life better you can take it you can leave that you can modify it but just know that I think we're in trouble as a culture if we continue down a road where these phones\nTake over and inter personal stuff that doesn't even matter anymore and it's all about hey the next grade as technology you know whatever that is has come down the pike and I'm just going to embrace it without even thinking we have to remember that we're thinking people and we have the option we can embrace it we can reject it and it's all about us\nWell gender Diaa below the
