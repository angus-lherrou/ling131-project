it was going\nAnd he caught a train down the Sherman, Texas to find work\nAnd he was camping out with a group of people that were just like him trying to look for work in the oil patch in Sherman, Texas and they kept telling him the story of the house up the hill\nWhere and I would appear in the upper a window of of this old haunted house is a it would appear and is it really\nHelped me well

campaigning for another radical\nThere's a reason why a guy named Robert Francis O'Rourke who calls himself veto has re Seventy million dollars on his receiving all this media attention\nFree media attention follow the candidates or not\n\nWe're going to have a special show on life liberty and all of them this Sunday ten pm mine is the last of the shows without reruns on Fox on the weekend before the election on that Sunday\nAnd I'm going to do things a little differently on that show I'm going to uh do a monologue and I'm not going to do it normally but I'm going to do it in this case because it's an extraordinarily important time in our history and I'm also going to have an expert on the program to go through a number of races that are very close and I consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling a very bleak force they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us to tone it down why they call our president Hitler\n\nAnd there's many big it's among them many like Don limit of CNN\nThe thing he said the other day is a fire rubble offense or Steve Schmidt on MSNBC another big it\n\nAnd the things he has said and I've gone through and look these are firing offense is but the executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors\nOf these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest they obviously want this they want a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation the United nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\n\nThey want centralized power with these corporations in these executives believe they can uh they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar it is that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statue will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it will be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware of that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it\nOr what have been done already these are the same people in Congress refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute outlawing birthright citizenship\nBut why passed a statute if in fact as the laugh says and some of these conservatives say 'cause they're no not things that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case that house a statue gonna fix statute won't fix it because they're\nSaying you have to amend the constitution when's\nThe last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way it's been a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did outside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional\nAmendment helps her\n\nAs we discuss the other day as I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me birthright citizenship was not actually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies the Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nBy the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and the statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass a statute while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle over Kavanaugh was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\nThe president happens to be right about this the president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to be right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happen to be wrong he knows more than they do\n\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there and the conservative review today left this concocted an ingenious game of judicial supremacy isn't that great say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they win yet the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship\nWith a left cherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous president\nThat plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq walk collectively ignoring enlist uninterrupted case law indicating the opposite\nOff for the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nThe fourteenth amendment representative James F wealth and Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in fat ugly that it was quote\nEstablishments no new right declaring no no principle on quote quote it is not the object to this bill to establish new rights but to protect and enforce those which belonged to every citizen unquote that's what he declared a Nineteen sixty six I Want you to think about it how many states\nRatify this amendment if they believed it wouldn't be applied to illegal alien babies known as birthright citizenship not one\n\nThat was passed to protect African American former slaves\nNot foreigners yet to be born who have no right to come into

a wonderful senator he would be Michigan this is a very very important race Montana you have a wonderful candidate running against a fraud\nTester\nAnother fraud pretends he's a moderate when he comes back to Montana buddy comes to Washington DC and I think he's from Massachusetts\n\nThe libertarian has dropped out of that race in Montana unfortunately a little late because of all the uh early voting but nonetheless\nRosendale is available you need to vote for him\nFlorida\nYou have a very very successful governor and Rick Scott\nYou have\nA worse than mediocre Senator Ben Nelson who exists

doesn't have to wait for the Democrats to vote to figure out the way he should vote he will not vote for Chuck Schumer to be the Democratic leader in the United States Senate how are you Patrick Morrisey\nI'm doing great mark Levin thanks for having me on your show I'm a big fan and I'm really excited to be on line and talking about the big issues and the U.S Senate race is going to be a lot of fun\nWell it's my pleasure go ahead and tell us the big issues where you stand and where your opponent stance\nAbsolutely well I think as many people are beginning to really follow this US Senate race in West Virginia they're seeing that there couldn't be a bigger contrast between the Republican and the Democratic candidates\nEh let's start at the base it I'm a conservative fighter mark you know I took on the Obama administration I sued them we had big victories in court it was West Virginia that led the way to defeat the Obama power plant that was just this amazing power grab over the United states\nEnergy supply we lead the way built the twenty seventh state coalition we stopped Rocco bomb at the U.S Supreme Court fact it was the last major decision\nOf Justice Scalia's lie that was the big deal we've let on many other big issues taking on the federal government in their own lawful unless I'm strongly pro life\nBy all the pro life groups because not only check the box on the issue of why I Believe in the fact of life and I'm actually in part responsible for a lot of the changes which have evolved in West Virginia so we have protections for the unborn\nI'm also strongly in support of the second amendment in our gun rights and we're working tirelessly to help President Trump we think President Trump has been doing incredible things for the country and for West Virginia and I'm proud to stand with them or running a campaign partnering up with this president\nBecause he is helping turn us around now the flip side of that\nIs you're dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion and he's just another one of these Washington politicians he went to Washington he drank the water and now he's in cahoots with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and all the radical liberals including Hillary Clinton on the issue of life\nHe sold out west Virginia values he actually literally had signs saying that he supports Planned Parenthood\nAnd also that he stood with life on the issue of life that's not a multiple choice questions you need someone who's ... who opposes taxpayer funding of abortion who wants to stop the government funding a Planned Parenthood on the issue is Second Amendment we need someone who's going to stand against the gun grabbers mansion\nIs best known for offering a big gun control bill\nAnd on the issue of coal oh I have to say is there he doubled down on his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work big differences between dishonest Washington liberal\nJoe mansion and conservative fighter Patrick Morsi and that's why we're going to win an election day in West Virginia\nYou know Patrick Morrisey there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps coming back to West Virginia to support you just because he not only support to he doesn't trust Joe Manchin and I noticed throughout his career in the Senate he waits and weights and waits to see if he can throw a safe vote\nThat isn't with his party he doesn't lead on anything am I right about that is\nYou're right and I think vice president Mike Pence said it very well he said quote Joe ... is always there when you don't need him and your great lime and all that terrific line and and really accurate about match ...\nNow what are your priorities among of you you mentioned a number of them\nI suppose you supported the president's tax cuts we reject this caravan you want a wall on the southern border\nRight man well absolutely so let's START I agree with all the above the Trump's tax cuts are good for West Virginia
