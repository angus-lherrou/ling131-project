{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "Social media posts where the ethnic biases with religious biases and all these things make social media vulnerable as well so it it really is a factor and this\nAnd also when you look at a hate groups across the country now\nA this has to be taken with a grain of salt because of the organization that compiles this\nList a is seen by some as a hate group themselves the Southern Poverty Law Center is put together a list of nearly a thousand hate groups across the country a better in every state in the union ranging from anti immigrant to anti gay to anti Muslim\nOr to a white supremacist so it really is something that appears to be pervasive but has made worse I agree with you by social media\nI think so because you can hide behind the anonymity and you don't have to worry about anybody a immediately refuting what you say I mean I get on this radio program and I say something that's incorrect or hate viewed in right away I have listeners who called moo he'll call me into a question and again keep me honest but you can't do that when you're\nA when you're on the or you can at least do it very choosing Lee if you're on social media\nUm and and I don't want to lean so far as to say these groups should be banned from\nA social media because I Believe in free speech it's when they do something illegal that's the problem\nYeah and the question is how do you track this how do you enforce this or how do you detect something that may be a coming up as possible illegal it's a very difficult thing to do due to the fact that there are so many platforms you and I don't know about I mean yeah social media so pervasive now and go so many different ways\nThat you're really not sure how to handle it but\nThis much we do know lay the FBI started tracking hate crimes in Nineteen Ninety two\nUh and after a spike after nine eleven which you might imagine something might happen there with the anti Muslim sentiment things really went down we hit an all time low and twenty fourteen\nBut in the last four years we have seen an increase once again and most disturbingly a significant increase in anti Semitic crimes I'm thirty five percent and twenty sixteen above fifty seven percent last year\nAnd now of course over the weekend is a poor event in Pittsburgh\nAnd a lot of people especially in the press are blaming this on the Trump Administration but the this guy was not a fan of Trump\nYeah this is what makes it so interesting it you know you could say okay this guy was part of an anti Semitic right wing organization a white supremacist group well those those groups in general are are are fans of President Trump and her backers of President Trump have no problem with them\nSo this guy had some differing profiles that make his case in particular a more a more critical than any others it's\nIt's another one that and you know you're going to have this I suppose uh but you have to start looking at\nUh the questions of again the gun control debate going to come up the mental health debate is going to come up a there are many aspects to this but what it continues to do is divide the country

Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what is taking place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with them what did you see there's there\nWhile it's a horrific act or worse anti Semitic attack in in us history that claimed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nGot to meet with a members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill\nA Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight knit\nIt's not just tight knit among the Jewish community but also the non Jewish community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh been really brought out the entire community faith leaders that Christians are Jewish faith leaders of Muslim leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and and the oh everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and stunned are and what I wanted to do is Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them and that they're not alone\nAnd they in Israel yesterday morning our government meets on Sunday 'cause some days like Monday in Israel the first day of the week\nAnd the government meets every Sunday and there was this a moment of silence where the entire government of Israel stood because we are the one and only Jewish state and so we feel or a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why it was important for me to be in Pittsburgh yesterday\nYou were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach where it was about that yeah we're the ones with ice speech that that's true [noise] um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see grooming anti Semitism throughout your him\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nKind of it is as you say a growing problem or many people want to say that it began in two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nAh in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen a hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population mark and their accounting for over half\nAnd by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of uh uh attack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen [noise]\nI really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades what you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is that it's once again become fashionable or to attack twos and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America it's all around the world you see in attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing to lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London\nAnd even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six to the G federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen at a Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives\nAnd this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media because you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people\nUm you can have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans\nUm and there's a stream is saying I can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis that could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities of hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media\nAs you have this rise of abuse online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous Senate\nDangerous and it it has given them a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment second to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see when sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the clock ticks place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I ... I think it's important for your uh forties to see what they can do to\nA is the day when CNN and MSNBC and these\nTo be reputable organization really focused on reporting the news rather than driving the news and creating the news these news conferences now at the White House you clean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] no\nLegendary thing they apply what did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring the bed of this country back to greatness and\nYeah we sort of stop paying attention and wrapped up a lot of\nThat yeah it was strapped he blamed for my credit card debt and I blame him for building not\nBuy time for the most iconic granted the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now pie times in one\nCase it's awesome anyway we stop blaming each other dinner homework and read that a smart way to consolidate debt is to get a fixed rate loan but\nWe're dot com dome is your chance to be part of history in the making busy at high time investor dot com that lifetime investor dot com\nHow does that ever ageless male max patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases a muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide\nIs holding course offerings will be made only by means of offering circular which has been filed with unqualified by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission these securities are highly speculative investing and chairs and kind of started\nGetting a loan was brutal and time drain so I was in my man gave researching personal loans and I found the best way to have an a plus rating with a ...\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe use of Maryland for terrifying attractions one location designed to get\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow is the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you the loan them he writes\nCalled today and let's get storey\nLead forth the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry on President of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nAt Hillsdale they understand the true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth he'll still students are challenged to discover the right way for it by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate and related things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution at living for Hillsdale dot com that's L.

anywhere else in the country trying to prop up a center McCaskill ended up by her seat\nAnd you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they\nThey don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat\nJust doesn't flying [noise] the the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in what are your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh\nIs a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power\nThe radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted and are not willing to accept\nThe results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said and that is a huge issue in this race\nImmigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress the most radical open borders bill ever introduced and a bed is a huge huge issue and then I think a\nA economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against\nThe middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes\nIn Congress and that people want somebody's going to be a fighter for the middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's pre existing conditions on the health care and they keep running around the country in every state by the way including your state with McCaskill saying you will oppose us a message of protecting people with pre existing conditions is that your position and she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my position that that's a total and ridiculous faucet and she knows it and I called her out on many times in our debates I support\nOf forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare to do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them all hostage to Obamacare in my state\nIncome health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent of those health care exchanges that at the national average things a hundred or two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan but is it Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that wonder\nShe she tries to duck and she says she's open to it you know she's open to of course we all know that that's where this is headed and we all know that that this she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on edge any major issue in his shoe consequences and you know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare\nImagine what they'll do to pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate\nThe folks who are or who have paid into the system it will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nBut you make a good point Medicare for all is Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to abolish every employer based private plan they have to abolish all private insurance and basically turn us into one ... right\nExactly exactly and you know the fact is Senator McCaskill has voted already to cut that seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars out of Medicare that's money
