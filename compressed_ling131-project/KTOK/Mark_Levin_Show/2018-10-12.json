Fox News Florida governor Rick Scott gives an update on the damage from hurricane Michael socks esteem Rapaport has more line\nKanye West was a guy that after Hurricane Katrina came out on national TV at a fundraiser and said George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then there wasn't a black Democrat in America\nWhen he said that that would have said this afterwards it was what happens when they grow don't read I\nThink about that Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read I Would argue that is an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from bakari sellers\nNow in ... west says this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people [noise]\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this\nIs what happens when negroes don't read snow\nAnd here you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou look at what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no\nBecause we've got employees that are black working in those schools and where unions as teachers and you can't destroy public edge ... education I Would agree with that you can you've already done it\nImpossible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left\nI Would argue the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools because that keeps them on their plantation\nThat keeps them in modern day slavery and so what happened was as you have a I I I'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro\nWho went from living on the plantation miss producer wants to play that audio again this is Kanye West while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great black man who's calling out an evil white president and it was okay to say that on that on that day because that was words that were okay to say on the Democratic plantation\nThen the ... comes out in ... and start singing for himself and start realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good\nI I'm seeing massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm saying are kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all of these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party he starts questioning the rich black guys\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them\nThat no no no no you need to stay in poverty because well take care of you there don't you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you can vote without id because we don't even expect you to have an id outrageous has that mentality and then ... says you know what\nI'm going to be independent I ought to be independent thinker I'm going to come out and\nSay that I like black unemployment rate in all the time I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs African American community and set of offering up welfare checks and food stamps\nAnd he does it and then\nThey reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nHow is that not the most racist statement\n\nIs it not racist because the Democrat says it not racist because the black person said is it not racist\nBecause it's supported by all Democrats\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's treats or ... or ... horrible\nThe same Democrats say that Donald Trump bullies people and it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets about this being national coming out day for the

democratic plantation now\nI'll be happy to hear you tell me how I'm wrong now I Would love for you to tell me why it's appropriate because a black man disagrees with the Democratic black party and walks off their democratic plantation and actually start to say things that makes sense about the reality of the economy\n\nHow this isn't shaming bullying racism how that says I mean the same party

calls on this one Madeline you are on the marquee event show than Ferguson filling in an eye hello\nAnd thank you so much and like you're doing an excellent job thrown into mark thank you I appreciate that\nThank you um I have two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt a number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was going in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances but when I started winning and mental health housing and I spoke out\nAbout somebody of use it that will go on and on\nAnd some you know quake nut rolls and what have you all of the sudden I feel that have led thoughts disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought ahead anything but you know mental illness from depression\nAnd uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of two places even up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of history of anything on a new homeless twice I've lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention month\nAnd I think by making it sound as ... as some kind of mental illness whether he ... is not even an issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him the four of them spoke out about Bush [noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWasn't he wasn't he got out her day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nTechnically we're just it just that people know that we were\nWhen we make it clear what did it yesterday was world mental health day two dozen Eighteen\nWorld Health a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I say this first of all thank you for your sharing your story and I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your wife or I ... my best friend in college\nUm took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and I have\nGreat compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token uh\nBlack man uh and and there and he's taking advantage of using him by putting them out there today\nNo one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative then you are on the Marco venture been for some reason I go ahead\nAnd stole my thunder but the uh uh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was all part of it that um they check this out so now Russia Walker is going to be the next soaking negro because he said that Don Lemon ...\nUm I think it's horrible what these lessons are doing but that's a whole other thing is talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only him I Will first she's the only attorney general to be a\nContempt of Congress but that's another issue when the Obama's going to we'll you when you know you really gone too far and show probably grabbed her by the IRS and said you can't do this for quite yet we're not there yet um\nBut him Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters are Democrats our base that's all they do is they're inciting violence and then they said in the in the means of\nOh and then and then they act like they get they get all you know their paintings in a wide\nWhen they when you say they're acting like a mob mentality when you have people screaming and beating on the doors of the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way that's that's a mob mentality when you surround a senator like Ted Cruz at dinner\nA that's a mob mentality when you go in and you can you do these eat in and sit ins and screaming in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking\nDo you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality deal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest be
