all then you know the point is we don't need it anymore so why should the federal government impose Fifteen Percent ethanol in fuel\nAnd it's been a big push by the left all these years now because it was done for eight months a year to make it a twelve month issue that is the sale of eat Fifteen ethanol blend all year round not just for eight months\nWhile the Democrats didn't do this the Trump Administration did all three of these things\nAll three of these things\nFord Motor company which I guess we're supposed to hate now has said the U.S steel costs more than anywhere else in the world they're spending an extra one billion dollars on manufacturing automobiles and you can see right now automobile sales are flat for new automobile\nBecause the prices are going up several thousands of dollars\n\nSo millions and millions of people are affected by that and they don't even know it same with refrigerators same with washers and dryers same with dishwashers\n\nSame with anything that as steel or for that matter lumina the prices are going up and that as a pressure on what inflation and you can start seeing inflation going up and interest rates going up\n\nI support the American

price transparency on pharmaceuticals here's what they need to do the same thing at the gas tank when you go there and they they show you are the prices in all show us the taxes\nShow us the cost show us the are indeed that went into that particular medicine\nNow or do you want transparency and give it give us all the trends parents that's involved\n\nYou see the amount of money that's being spent you can read in the newspaper all the time to find various cures for cancer you see the amount of money that's being spent did find cures for dementia and Alzheimer's the amount of money that's being

before\n\nYou know the government tried to regulate the cost of vaccines under Clinton and other administrations you know what happened we had one vaccine company left and they couldn't make enough vaccines and then they at a hospital so we had to import vaccines from Europe\nAnd other places\nWhen the government gets involved prices\nGo up demand goes up quality goes down availability goes down this\nIs a matter of fact it's not a matter of conservatism liberalism socialism capitalism is a fact it is experience it's provable\n\nSo now we're driving up the cost of consumer goods big consumer

decline\nIt's starting to happen with re sales now why is that while the media will tell you mostly\nThat it's because of increasing interest rates will interest rates are increasing but ladies and gentleman they're nowhere near high interest rates four percent four and a half percent many of us I've lived through eleven twelve Twenty one percent interest rates this is nothing historically it's minimal\nThat's not why why you know why Mr producer\nBecause you can't the duct all of your interest payments on mortgages and all your property taxes anymore\nThere's that ten thousand dollar threshold and it's doing exactly what I said it would\nHave in a negative effect on home sales those if you want to resell your homes whether it's in a red state blue state I don't care you're in

this are rescue that\nWe never learn our lessons so I\nPicked at least for industries now that this administration is interfered in in a significant way and I'm greatly concerned about it because that creates precedent for I left wing cook president that come in and say hey look Trump Administration did it I'm only building on what they've done\nThat the man who made this nationalism frame famous in the last century was Theodore Roosevelt a progressive\nAnd he gave this famous speech called the new nationalism speak and they talked about all the things big centralized government was going to do and that's when I said to the president at least on the air\nYou don't want to be that do you we're not talking about national as we're talking about American is\nWhen you say America First you're not saying nationalism first\nWe believe in federalism\n\nNow I Know what the president meant you know what the president meant for the left it was just another opportunity to defame the president and the dumb down what Hitler did it's sick\n\nBut words meaning they've consequence\n\nYou listening to me you're not nationalist severe naturalist you believe in big centralized government the national government at all times these would be the state governments are local governments that's not what you believe it's not nationalism versus globalism it's constitutional isn't\nVersus globalism it's capitalism that we embrace constitutional is individual is\nJust to put a fine point on it\nThere's no reason the government should be involved in what goes into your tank on your car your gas tank or

the mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit had nothing to do with the president know ideas said Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow when shown the docket for the case\nAttorneys for Roger Stone said they didn't know of anyone challenging a mile a subpoena beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects\nOf the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses Mahler investigation also said there were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district quarter sealed\nThe DC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen the initial appeal was filed five days later\nStay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone filed a motion to quash or otherwise resisted\nThe grand jury subpoena and the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know a Gibson Dunn and crush or attorney who is handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nChunk clear whether the case the appeals court has agreed to hear and December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack on most of the party or perhaps advances both sets of arguments very hard to tell from the stock and well I'll tell you\nIt's not hard to tell at all Mr Miller ... challenged\nWe know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I've been making\nAnd professor ... has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again I because I have first hand knowledge\nBut because remember what took place a few months ago\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat the mullahs investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of its authority and legal legitimacy before ... judges relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of his criminal cases but\nAll the human defendants who set foot in a courtroom and ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel the party or tactics\n\nMystery cases moving through the courts and Robin grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't uncommon in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America or chief Eli seagulls fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nIn the final report remains at a public view involving another Clinton era pro the labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\nThis can't\nThis can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer in the Russian inquiry Belair recalled a case from a previous investigation where you couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion because there was under steal\nArt\n[noise]\nI'm fairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller I counsel as I said the question the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause and the DC circuit has been packed\nA wood left is an Obama appointee so who knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation\nAlso to take it to the United States Supreme court and despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst and others this is not the Martian versus Olson case a Thirty Years' ago involving the independent counsel\nThe elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and in professor calories his opinion respecting Muller\nAnd this is why these two questions are important to stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before is Mr Mahler\nA principal officer of the federal government or is he an inferior office for purposes of a challenge\nTo the appointments clause of the constitution I have no doubt that he insists that he's in a fear officer so reports to deputy attorney general Rosen ...\nThat he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate he's nothing more than an inferior office official like some assistant United States attorney or jeopardy\nTo an assistant attorney general now you know that's not true he's got more power than a U.S attorney\nAnd the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial appointment was enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that so this isn't like Martian versus ...\nNow the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not\nIt's a legitimate challenge of is it's hard I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nAnd I more than ... suspect I Believe strongly that that's the ping pong that's going on between the trial court the district court and the appellate court back and forth and that's why the appellate court is so there's going to hear the case and again as I said that court\nIs heavily loaded with a a leftist activist so the the final case will have to be made to the Supreme Court if they'll accept that we'll be right back [noise] much\nHim

and the control what takes place in that state prior to the twenty twenty election as they would Texas and uh it's very important those rates the taking place in Florida and the Democrat is about as radical left as you can get\nIn the left all over the country is pouring millions and millions of dollars into this including billionaires who the the usual suspects run to scientists who have strongly endorsed Ron dissent is um\nTallahassee is a very corrupt government under this mayor there's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum\nHe got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he has a very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government to get basically sending money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars and so what these lobbyists did is they arrange a number of it\nSkirting one of which was the New York city I'm In a long for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who are trying to own infiltrated\nA he was posing as a contractor trying to do business with the city of but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to go see the play Hamilton when people hear about the Hamilton ticket they did it by going to be a movie the tickets were at least a thousand dollars at that\nTime um and so he gave it to Andrew Andrew knew that injures lied about that but now there's been evidence that shows that but then those same lobbyist also arranged a luxury for night stay\nIn this Costa Rica villa which ended up costs and about a thousand dollars a friend drew and his wife or an addition to some other folks and again the injured and pay for that and then what happens after all this mark\nLow involved mayor Andrew Gillum turns around and he gives those lobbyists that two million dollar deal that they were looking for and so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobby it's got a exactly what they were paying for and so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt it's wrong I'm Andrew has you know he lied to the country on Sunday night when I confronted him about this\nBut then documents came out almost immediately that refuted\nIs denial showed he was lying um and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can because he just refuses to take responsibility but at the bottom line is still to this day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you are very smart in the law you understand the stuff\nWhat an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential drive like that if they weren't investigating the public official that only reason you would do such a thing\nOf course nobody knows if he's in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people in him\nOh it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation I mean by that much for your um\nIt's interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem\nAnd his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said he ... not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission uh because the bottom line is why would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents\nAround him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] and run to send to see immediately tried to racialized decision that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any tuck it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nIf you want all three of them dot

you are a survivor tell us your story\nI was thirty five years old when I was I guess a breast cancer and I was also seven weeks pregnant when I was diagnosed\nAnd it was a very interesting journey for me and my husband was a big support we really mean to each other during that time went through chemo while pregnant wow it was ... years I could not imagine doing it without the team of doctors that I had very specialized amazing doctors\nAnd had our daughter took about a four week break resumed chemo and then get dirty rounds of radiation and here we are four and a half years later and I have a beautiful almost four year old daughter and my husband are still rocket and we're doing good\nIt's a great great story because you hear that word my wife is a cancer survivor been Dimitri of cancer when you hear that word everything goes blank I don't remember driving home from a hospital Christina maybe there was the same experience for you\nAnd the first thing that came out of my mouth when uh I got till the had cancer I looked at my husband said what if I have a lumpy had [laughter] it's like all of the things that can go to your mind and all the things that you can say in that moment the only thing that came out of my mouth with what if I have a ...\nBut you were worried about it's spreading added already spread I imagine too\nI think I knew that got the chemo and I was wary about how it's going to look in okay and that was just kind of scary and you never know like what to say or what to feel and\nAlso knowing that I was pregnant too it was oh good lord they were kind of it was very scary I'm about an hour after we received my diagnosis we heard our dollar's heartbeat for the first time while so\nI think for me in that moment knowing that she was her hardly it was good when she was going to be okay we were going to be okay I had no choice but to be okay and it worked out very well for us I mean I went there treatment and responded well and we're doing good\nAnd you are and that's another one of the positive stories that have come out of the help of the American Cancer Society miles against breast cancer coming up this weekend at least you were hearing more and more the success stories it's not the death sentence it used to be\nYeah so we're we're super excited to hear about that and to have people like Christine on board with us so we have for portions of hope every single year we have ... but they kind of go around the community and share their stories and talked about making strides against breast cancer and how people can get
