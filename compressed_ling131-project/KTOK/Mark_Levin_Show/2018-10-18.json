eight seven seven three one two three one one last night before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on that uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system as I just told you\nSeventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine percent never get U.S Supreme court and so if in twenty days the Senate flips to the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point and Trump has reelected which most of us believe he will understand the state's democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate you could nominate but they went out confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental secondly all the investigations if the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations have every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life\nJared Kushner's life everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare\nAnd the next two years to not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in charge of Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable and other aspect of course his foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good North Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by\nThe Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international expertise the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats want to eliminate Trump from office so if you went the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about a and only about investigations and impeachment and it hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot\nSo when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with him on a play some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens go there just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be it should be do I like all the tweets so I like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good and so I\nThink about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are as incentivized says they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivized the mob by buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los Angeles and Chris in Atlanta of line

L. M. got what they want it what are we went dead cops when he won them now and ... were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because\nOf who did it one officer Jason Ellis was murdered in a bar it's down Kentucky ambush killing we don't know who did it and at this point\nIs in the media spent time instead of the show geek in Turkey\nTake up the calling of a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform\nAnd spent time as to who killed him and why was murdered re most so Lewis killed according to this black nationalist he said that he wanted to come and kill police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown and Eric Garner\nAnd so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not do Michael Brown tried to kill a police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt\nBy Obama's Justice Department than Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events there was a sick mind in Baltimore who thought police officers short fold because of the way CNN covered the killing\nOf Michael Brown who was an armed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson and grabbed his gun inside the police car and that was proven that was proven\nBut the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder nationalist the hunt down ... New York city and murder them\nWhy didn't CNN covered that aspect to the story and the fact that Obama in the White House repeatedly met with representatives of black lives matter that advocate at the

deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they would say so that's why I refused to call it after I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where\nSo many jobs and talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nTalking about millions of jobs for judges don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before but now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on\nI Know we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years I mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries\nThey have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's sort of ... percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look\nWe want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but are going to give you one more chance and it has said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately after the plan and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with him I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or

counting on the great American I Want to share with some of the headlines from the mainstream media about Elizabeth Warren good friend a rich Samantha's Elizabeth Warren\nABC News said this on Monday and Elizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry about that headline about the a P supposedly objective independent the AP quote Warren DNA shows Native American heritage\nAbout CNN you'll love this one this is as of Monday Elizabeth Warren\nYou know Pocahontas quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests was strong evidence of Native American ancestry BBC\nElizabeth Warren DNA tests fine strong evidence of Native American blood\nThat strong evidence amounts to something less than point one percent in reality she is less Native American blood than the typical so called white American has Native American blood it's unbelievable and uh about\nThe Daily Beast on Monday quote breaking news Elizabeth Warren releases her DNA test yes she is Native American\nHow 'bout that Boston Globe her hometown newspaper quote Warren reveals test confirming ancestry NBC News then nobody but Clinton network NBC News quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she is Native American heritage when you break down the numbers\nThe testing that this person did involve samples from Columbia in Peru not from America\nAnd that she is something less than point one percent Native American blood that she played for decades as a minority to make money\nAnd so it's amazing to me how the media covers for those protected inside the progressive tribe if you're part of the group\nAnd your Louis Farrakhan using hate speech against Jews Twitter went up and you\nIf you're in the group like Brock Hussein Obama and you admit in the presidency using drugs committing felonies it's no big story at all but if you're outside the group and your name is Brett Kavanaugh and when you were Fifteen Years old you drank beer\nOr had some posting in your your book my God that's a big story\nSo Clinton in office as president drugs no problem Brett Kavanaugh drank beer you're ... when he was Fifteen major major problems and so I look at the park receipt of what's happening now in Turkey\nWith
