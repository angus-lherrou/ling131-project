the media has been under attack by the White House for very long time it's not an issue with just the current administration and stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to say anything about\nIt the crazy thing is today the craziest thing is is\nThat the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was ... the FBI and the de OJ against the press Donald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nFor it but it is calling us\nFake news yeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated depressed compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in jail he was ...\nThe government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\n\nBecause the media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times was publishing an article\nOn the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is what you know just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little bit\nThere being called fake news\nThey're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta\nAnd while\nThis is happening the New York times is printing ... an article\nTitled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter five novelists imagine Trump's next chapter\nThe main image at the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye each novelist had one assignment right out what you think happens after the Mueller investigation is completed okay [laughter]\nSo let's come up let's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen with Mueller's investigation and what's going to happen\nImmediately after and you mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come a surprise they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not\nGuilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump signing the twenty Fifth Amendment a and another even had him of being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated we're not advocating violence I don't know what ... what are you are you kidding me\nKnow that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is ... oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five riders and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's going to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable how is it\nThe two hundred journalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the American media is writing this bull crap while the pipe bombs are coming in\nThis this time space exhibit a\nFor why journalism is currently dead in America it is dead in America\nAll of you do question that oh my gosh lock her in a tower oh my gosh she's got to be chased out of the public so you can ask a question don't you dare really what was her what was her big thin she asked\nA question that oh my gosh lock her in a tower oh my gosh she's got to be chased out of the public's where you can ask a question don't you dare ask a question\nThis is frightening America fact\nFinding is gone the media has already made up their mind they know the answer and if you disagree they will\nSo you out of the public square they have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\nYes there's a little righteous indignation and me it's not an anger is it is righteous indignation\nBecause I have called these people I have talked to these people I have\nGone to them over and over again we've had in hand and said listen you need to understand how half the country feels\nJust have a conversation you're making a huge error and yes I made all these errors oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is saying\nThey won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now they're quite literally making it up what's the difference between a novelist and in New York Times journalist I don't know\nMedia [noise]\nThis is a radical concept and I know you like radicals you love radical\nYou don't you feel like there's nothing wrong with being radical mob yeah those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nBy here's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[noise]\nFriday on ... desk in fact the land back program [noise] self awareness seems to be dead at this point in the media in particular Glenn me give you this one what is the one thing that\nIf you're conservative Trump makes the ACA criticisms of the media they say\nHey it's fake news hey these guys are lying hey they're the enemy of the people and they say that the same as violence\nLike you're you're you're you're creating ... coming after ... ... I Can't go there yet I Can't I Can't I got to take a break I Can't go there yet a cat I Know where you're going and boy does it need to be said I Can't do it yet cat\nThe cat you needed to you know I just crank that was about ... anything that's it again I'd been telling you for years to get to your alcohol if we can reignite that it's gonna be a good ratings boost can can I tell you something the blackouts I Need the blackout right now I Need them so desperate and All right it would be so grades\nI forgot about everything that they said that was so stupid yesterday [laughter] I don't even recall it at all I Love that idea\nI Need to take a break first let me tell you about car shield car shield is uh is is going to save you from a lot of trouble they're going to save you from taking your car in and\nYou've got something wrong with it or even an oil change and then it comes out and they're like her got some bad news for you and we found semester stuff and it's going to cost and you're like why\nLook\nUh some bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bombs sent to CNN had the hallmarks of fake explosives kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonated almost like a Wylie coyote kind of\nBomb almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the ... of feature that experts say it's typically shown on fictional\nBombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension ah but I'm very in real life\nI'm ... in fact the fact\nThey go on the New York times in fact bomb makers generally avoid attaching visible clock their devices really keep\nFrom tipping off they're targeting no about when the bombs are said to explain it was just a like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their death [laughter] that's what I thought oh look at that and you're like that's not a bomb here's a here's a bonus if you survive\nIt that it got an alarm you know what one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're is weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this okay someone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures\nBut aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually wanna kill they want to do that as a poor you want to know what you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong Italy horrible despicable\nAnd everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like bomb if you look on I mean you get this example of this on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible\nThings that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend on doing they don't intend on a you know you saw what happened to for example Dana lash right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh ... she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God right so you have these serious threat that come into public figures often ends and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look at terrorists I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would\nUh execute a terrorist attack on on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I said is\nHe is so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens however obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether there are in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election or sending these things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make a big media circus if things are all plausible possibilities we have no relatives and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work and they're really all that all the information we have right now\nWell but I Know that's that's pretty much all the information they had on the race dog fire and um I don't know about you but I think the Germans behaved admirably I think the Germans did exactly how to do with you on that one no\nBut isn't the rice

know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy but he chose the fight back\nTrumped it and he said I'm not gonna let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter they see me as a person who\nStrikes back when attacked so while I'm going to do that so then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this\nAnd you can make a case that Trump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow how he's he's assuming people names yeah\nHe's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your feeling be and kit to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came later\nWhen it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win see what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump\nCould\nDo anything you want to have a chance he was he was like entertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear that's how the press on him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed and I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does\nOkay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but it\nWas very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does\nTrump counter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates I mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very blunt\nAnd sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice\nWhat if he doesn't do it\nThey are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah in the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that but he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him and the reason he has it been is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights\nBack but now they're turning it around saying well your\nYour fight back like Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if that fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where CNN and we're not responsible for any of it or not us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch them so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh how much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times\nLiterally paragraph thirty five in the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened to us from the jump of course they're cartoon bombs they are the only thing it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this is written by mayor yes was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy could be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing\nCould be somebody who is just a really unbelievably worse the bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt it could very\nAnd we'll be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press we're gonna send these to all of the all of the enemies of the right obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms of putting my money on putting\nYeah [laughter] [laughter]\nHow do we how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank withheld political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that was why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flashes up pretty quickly\n... how would depress handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out of the Washington DC think tanks progression think tanks and stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff\nSo that they'll they'll sit down and okay now how are we going to spin this may be the person sending it was insane or you know that kinda thing they'll never say well gee maybe um our side\nIs so craves now that we have to criticize our side you're never going to see that\nEver

in the Senate or lost uh we're in for an amazing wild ride a especially economically I think we are already in for a wild ride and one of the reasons I'm becoming more and more concerned\nAbout the trade war um but imagine imagine if the house in the Senate or just a house or controlled or what is the president going to be able to do uh on the economy what does the president going to be able to do without a Congress or when it comes to just the skirmish on the border\nYou imagine if you imagine what that is going to be like\nGold line has just put a report together a on what you can expect if there is a democratic victory you can get this report for free just by calling them I don't know if you've been paying attention to the stock market um but you know instead of this ah this this bombing things from somebody who is clearly\nEither incompetent unstable or just wants attention\nBut we should be paying attention to what's happening in the stock market what's happening with the economy read this report I've read it I've already shared it\nYou need to get it to its free all you have to do is call gold line right now and ask them for their election report a doorway called them

he would have no answer for any of that\nBill tell me who's behind this who's financing this\nWell I Do believe it's the progressive crew um the George Soros people\nUm because that was done it in the past that we did a big thing on Bill O'Reilly dot com last night about Soros after CBS glorified and\nWe said no I'm the he's pumping in two thousand Eighteen this year alone tens of millions of dollars into the worst organizations and by that I mean they attack and smear anyone they disagree with David Brock runs one of them\nThat's the media matters guy and I don't tell me that's you know this was a benevolent mad so I Believe that these\nKinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability and Honduras but I Believe they're behind a big ... big money behind as everybody knows\nA bill I and I invite you to read what even the president of on tourists as saying I'm this is this is backed by a cube of the Venezuela a and ousted president of Honduras\nAre that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this or they'll have to accept our citizens this is just an ongoing internal battle a in Honduras that\nHas quite honestly lied to many of their people um and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this mess this is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government\nFound what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now he Venezuela in Cuba are together and what was formerly known is all about but they are pissed at the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it\nThat's how it started now sorrows or others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipeline of cash going into ... to ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth the George Soros or people like him did this but if you know it's it's\nOne of his things they've done in the past but the\nThe government of Honduras should be able to trace foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here\nSo\n... I Hope they do that if they if they believed Cuban Venezuela are actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and then by extension hurting the usa they have the ability to find that out\nThere are a let's go there are two other groups that are being formed now are two other waves that are supposedly following this one uh and I would love to hear when we come back what you think the president should do uh what do you think it looks like\nIf they do arrive at the border are and how the press is going to treat this and what do sane Americans do to counter that when we come back with Bill O'Riley [noise]\nOne thousand chain new king\nInstall a complete train heating and air system from hill and company for zero percent financing or up to Seventeen hundred dollars in ... think of it as much you could be spending a pumpkin spice everything\nTo tie him I call\n... making a murderer became let the TV show than a force\nOf nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice and it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this even Avery and Brendan daffy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part two of rebuilding a\nMurderer reminding a murderer is now on the ... I heard radiolab just open the Avon thought cat [noise]\n\nYou're on the ground for Bill O'Reilly bill let me lay out a scenario here and he told me where it's where\nI'm off days I don't think of this caravan helps the Democrats in the mid term elections and it's why\nThe press is saying oh there's no there's no evidence that they're going to come all the way to the border and they're dismissing it and that's just a crazy conspiracies the seeing the ghetto the Trump supporters all round up\nThere all dismissing this now um I I Can't believe that the they're going to make it by the mid term election I think this is the to the to arrive\nAfter the mid term election a and a possible new Democratic House which will throw us into chaos hey you think there's any reality in their ... be what do you see coming in and how things are going to shake out\n[noise] why I said on Bill O'Reilly dot com I now who says that the Mexican government will break up\nA lot of the uh the caravan before\nThey start getting on to vehicles because they're not going to walk to Macau in Texas or to wanna\nUm San Diego sector either not going to do it so they're at a they're approaching a railway term in is now in Mexico some of them will get on trains heading north Austrians have to stop it in Mexico city and that's where I Believe the Mexican government to start to intervene\nUm some of them will make it I'm\nNow and they're not going to walk so you don't think it\nBe a mass nada break 'em up that's what you know look the state department palm pay I was down there now army needs screaming at them now that you know if you let these people en masse go to the border we're gonna take economic reprisals on Mexico and that's what they'll do and they know it so they'll break it up\nBut some people will reach and some people would get they're mostly in vehicles um that's where the smugglers command the cartels come in a ... a\n... house in front the at us already has vehicles down there um you can do trains you can do a whole bunch of thought but when it gets to that point\nThey um border authorities will put up barriers new barriers and there'll be man by us troops\nAnd it will be no way for the migrants to get to any U.S officials to apply for asylum drums already said he's going to do that he has to do it um the left is hoping for some kind of violent confrontation that's what they would like to see\n'em but I agree with you that this is not helping\nThe Democratic party I'm In the vote ten days from now how bad it's hurting them it depends what section of the country you rent\nOr do you ah um do you see the the\nPossibility that real radicals would like to set up a a Palestinian uh Israel situation at our border and it would be handled exactly the same way by the media as they handle the Palestinians and Israel they\nThey show the big bad state beating up on the on the little guy do you I mean I I said two years ago this is what our border is eventually going to look like they're going to set up a\nA palace in standing in kind of situation and we're going to be Israel I mean they've already done this you know on the small stage bring it you know bring it to Broadway bring it to the American border and that's the way they'll play it\nMay be but there's all the ... the Mexican government does not want that All right they don't they they don't want that got problems on the border um ... you know war is one of the worst places in the world Tijuana right behind\nThey don't want all this because it drains their infrastructure I mean this is an environmental disaster for Mexico these people only facilities that they are the water they need food Mexican people are poor there's not the infrastructure to support their so yeah\nSo how do they would love shanty towns there with ... mothers and babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and what the man sure but the Mexican government I'm telling you is under tremendous pressure by the Trump Administration not to allow any of this to happen\nSo so um how do you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian

him that his arm was fine and this was in his arm\nSometimes we just don't know how to deal with things\nFor two solid weeks I lied to myself my daughter was fine and this didn't happen didn't happen to her it didn't happen to us and I broke down in tears\nFinally able to process what had fallen my now seven year old daughter my wife forgave me for spending those two weeks\nIt wasn't until months after\nThat we would figure out who had done this terrible thing only wanted to do after she told me about this was find this uh this guy and cut off the offending appendages\nAs it turned out it was a twelve year old boy he was in my Sunday school class for ten months I had been teaching this boy in Sunday school\n[noise]\n[noise] oh how I hated and wanted to hate this young man\nI wanted to ruined his life before it even began\n\nWanted to let you know that in the height of my hatred I downloaded your book addicted to outrage on audible\n\nWho's the last couple of chapters and I heard you speak\nThat I I realize that my outrage was justified but it was also toxic and it would become a force to be used to destroy me\nI needed to forgive this boy because we are required to forgive all men\nI forgave him in my heart\nAnd as I did I felt the burden of my outrage and my anger lifted\n\nYes the pain of what happens still lingers and the reality of the situation is still very real but my outlook in my spirit or no longer held hostage by might hate\n\nI just wanted to thank you for writing this book it literally helped me pick myself out of darkness so deep that I thought there was no way out\n\nI wanted to let you know that your work has helped save at least\nOne guy Christian\n\n\nChristian is a hum\n\nAs a man who has gone through a similar situation recently with one of

I wasn't home my wife may have killed him\n\n\n\nI think about it all the time to think about my children all the time\nAnd\n[noise]\nYour email has reminded me\n\nThat it's not just me right I haven't talked to my wife about it\n\nFor the last few months and I know how much it still bothers me\nHow we're responsible I had been to not realize she is probably dealing with it as well\n\nThere are things that we don't want to think about\nThat are truly frightening and I think\nWhen we look at our country when we look and we really realize\n\nWhy do we really stand to lose it's not our job spent our money it's the unsinkable\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us that happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoid it and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\n\nIf you said there was somebody if you said to everybody you met in the next two weeks you know you look like you could use some tearing up I think you'd be right about eighty or Ninety percent of the time\n\nAcross all income levels across all colors and boundaries\nWe're all struggling with something and we all have something big to forgive that man we don't want to\n\nBeing now it is a rest of us suspect uh his um his a van is covered in stickers I mean the guy's nuts\nIf I were to ask you before this can you sketch out what you think this guy's Japan looks like you would have picked but yeah\nUh it covered and decals and seemingly political messages I it yet I Can't quite zoom in to see exactly what they say\nThat they have uncovered the van there now covering it so with blue tarp so no one can see it yeah uh but uh it do you we've had a blurry picture of it and it looks like it may be a guy on the right\nOr at least a ... you know it's hard to tell exactly there's certainly political messages all over and flags all over it does appear to be a ... a picture of Trump in the presidential seal I mean could it be\nA it could be either to be I don't like this guy's president right I mean I Know it you know again this is what people are speculating at this point if it's hard to see honestly from the pictures you'll get a picture pretty soon though that's clear I'm sure\nI'm you know but we're going to find this out relatively quickly yeah where this guy goes I mean this is a really quick arrest it does support the idea\nThat he was at an as does the fact that zero the bombs went off completely incompetent and crazy I mean the fact that you you mail bombs and they're finding this quickly is it you know shows a lack of level of sophisticated on it really does yeah so we'll see we're going to do fairly quickly I think oh this guy may\nBe just a really bad incompetent version of the Bernie Sanders guy uh that was competent when he was trying to kill all the the Republicans are about a year ago looks like this maybe\nOur version of that guy fortunately our version if you will is a completely inept and incompetent and no one was hurt\n\nYeah I mean if if if that's true what the van ... and we don't know and should be noted [noise] of course he is absolutely not guy [laughter] you know I Know is that it was but there were going to say\nMy guy either yeah but you know they're going to assign him as you know this is what a Trump supporter is like and blah blah blah and you know there are those people on both sides\nAnd this is why it is so a terrifying it's not going to be a rational person that causes these things they're not gonna be rational\nYou're gonna be nuts they're going to be absolutely nuts uh and uh and that's what's\nFrightening is ... the media just puts all of the nut jobs on the right in as the regular person right when it comes to the left they don't even reports some but they certainly say well that's not\nThat's not you know that's not who Bernie Sanders is that's not a Bernie Sanders follower well I agree with you I agree with you why is this guy all of a sudden any less than the guy from Bernie that that was a Bernie Sanders volunteer\n... and as we said at the time and Bernie Sanders is not responsible for shooting at a baseball field endures Donald Trump responsible for this as any logical person that's ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to note um but you know again this is we were not going to know enough about this this is but this is a product\nOf the world we are creating now and that is all of us all of us are creating this\nUm and you know it's not going to stop until both sides realize it until the media says okay wait a minute\nWhat do we do what did we do that makes you think that we're the enemy what do we do and actually listen to half the country\nThen we can move forward and create a better tomorrow ...\nGlenn Beck one use radio one thousand Katie okay\nExperience I'm Wondering excitement as Oklahoma City down they present Alice in

history has ties to New York they have wrapped his a white van up so you can't see anything because he looks like a crazy mad as one of those\nYou know it's one of those vans where there's stickers over every bit of it um we're not sure it looks like he was a Donald Trump or a big\nBig big big big big big big big big big big big\nCrazy big fan of Donald Trump emphasis on crazy [laughter] uh you know but we we don't know for sure because it it looks like that's what those stickers are but we don't have a clearer picture of it\nYeah yeah I'm get get get on Internet I mean we don't want to see how long have we have to wait until this is two thousand Eighteen I Want it immediately I Want to know that they want to have like an hour ago I went this guy in jail by now I Want to know and speaking of that by the way I mean isn't the bigger problem here don't we just stopped selling vans\nBy an ... fan stopped selling white vans and arrest all people who own white vans that if you're driving around in the white van right now we'll give you a good no\nNo no we not Europe to no good if you're driving a white van right now we know you're up to no good what did you smell\nBut what what was it was there ... or is it about which one was where were you know at home sleeping last night can you verify that have witnesses do you have do you have a discount the fact that makes it that looked like an ice cream truck she can lure little kids and there is that what\nI said I bet you're doing okay\nWhat else would you do with a white van and twenty Eighteen well in the business uses and well they wouldn't be this show no they'd bring up all sorts of things if I mean if they have their own show they can make that point I suppose\nWasn't the guy wasn't the guy in Virginia [laughter] was it so if you disagree with this give your own show a pleasant the guy in Virginia didn't he have a\nVan to I thought he was living in his van or something wasn't ... yeah it's I think you're right yes he was because he went to um he he would be that the YMCA the local YMCA so when the shooting happened they all knew where he was and they knew who he was because he was very\nHe he lived in another state and drove there should basically camped out there and prepare for the shooting right he was\nHe was a Bernie Sanders guy a big big big big big big big big crazy big Bernie Sanders guy and he was living in is man\nI mean it's going to be interesting to see I think there's several distinctions to several additional levels to this let's say we find out that this is exactly what is it is the person it is his band these are pro Trump stickers whatever I mean we don't know any of those things for sure yet\nUh but if we find that out it'll be an interesting distinction just see if he is the ... he either a very incompetent\nLunatic who tried to blow up people and failed hang out more we hold on I Want more than ... or ... he's a a lunatic who ah was just try to scare people did not intend to kill people that will be an ... a distinction that will be interesting in the investigation did you see is when I\nYou know I'm going to guess incompetent [laughter] get get the coveted too because of an like that you know if you're thinking I'm going to put a sticker on my found my bag because I Want people to know and maybe it'll change their heart maybe it'll change their mind\nYet that bands and not that bad it's not that that man is like a ... stay away from this guy\n... let me ask you this yeah in in American history\nGo for it in global history a global has has there ever been an individual who has been won over by a mess\nThis is a collection of bumper stickers on a car has anyone ever changed in opinion are considered a new one because someone not from one bumper sticker because I think that's even possible but\nMaybe even a couple of maybe not now where are you going to write three you're pushing it you have\nA three hundred bumper stickers covering all of your windows you are not convincing anyone to your viewpoint I think you know those people because of it oh no if you have a nature\nWay you're you're you're going to be kicked out you're going to they're going to tell you to move because you're a spoof to death all of the neighbors even the ... you could be living in the most anti ... you could be living in a neighborhood\nWith

know we have standards yeah\nYou're nuts I just really hope if Jesus comes back or he's not in the van [laughter]\nYou don't you know he comes in a white van with you about your bumper stickers people are not going to buy it they're just gonna be like I don't believe this guy there's no way back like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming right or maybe that's how he met us how he
