comes to Oklahoma Katie okay Beth Myers reports\nIt was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what sign for you to walk to the United states\nAnd I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and you get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just hear in trusting your children to\nWho knows what ... where's the personal responsibility of the parents here\nYeah I mean there's got to be some there is and I think their case would be or at least the case to left would make on their behalf would be uh the you know things are so bad so\nBad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite like\nWant to say that we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's seven ... the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant pond there in a green area is common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like\nAlone [laughter] without your brother [laughter]\nWhat do you stop and think about how you know\nPretty protective ... yeah exactly I\nI don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nWith a group of people that I don't know [laughter] look\nThere are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there are certain level of\nThis and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations are like this or is there probably are some but it it's just it you try to it's\nThe same thing with the dreamers right they ... they tried to give you the picture of everyone is a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen\nAnd Seventeen years old that this is a ... it's a different story a and\nYou just want her first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that ... when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this it you know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner ... right\nAnd you know like I mean for a thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nRight it feels like waiting does they're just ... like the top of the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right look over running the security\nThat they're there you're coming in or the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet\nOr the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a fairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful\nUh were uncaring were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody's snakes from Nicaragua or some other countries in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they go and work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back them then back to them if they do it without permissions they send back them but we can't uh were expected to just accept every but we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law\nThey've got to streamline law that insurers foreign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves economically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society\nWeight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights or that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even go can't interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport you I mean that's a [noise] a\nDaily racist right I mean like that is not yes there's not an argument there\nWould never know you can't do that you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans and the ... percent we want to make sure we're still keep Seventy or eighty percent I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't think of a warden Trump supporter\nWho would have a ... a support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages\nOf white people versus other races you wonder if people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society or going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me and that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's\nPolitically wanted to split the bottom line is we are we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up\nThat is a completely lets a larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah the people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting at the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that yeah saying hey used this use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard any of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe someone someone somewhere is\nBut it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the party\nI did hear at all talking about it in the debate and I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race\nIn Arizona a race or where I'm at Sally has I think a great chance of winning or people do to get because her opponent there is like if you took Michael Moore\nAnd put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman\nYou would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's fasching Arizona oh yeah hang in the lab of democracy she's saying people are crazy in Arizona\nShe's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows I mean she is as it's incredible but they decided to run her and just thought that this stuff would not come out\nOh I don't every one who know every one is called Albert is called no every what everybody born\nIn El Paso that's of Irish American\nDescent that

I Know LeBron James was one of the people who would who who's kind of excited about\nAbout Beto I'm I'm not sure if you go over to football or be G. three or was one of these people a former Redskins quarterback B.D three of who is I don't know if he's donated at all but we'll find out about that or it's going to be interesting musical celebrities as well like a herb that show with the Tijuana Brass\nWhat do they do yeah I don't know I [laughter]\nI'm not sure exactly I all I Know is anyone with those letters you get to bed or somehow yes and I'm sure I mean this goes back to back to kids playing pranks on each other like if I if I Do a prank call the right now are you know phone's ringing you answer it mhm\nHello uh Hi do you have prince better when Ken this is so common\nIt goes back so long it's so deeply ingrained deep in in our in our community yeah her her's fried Beto everyone knows that I remember that everyone's ... for my child yeah everyone watched and I'm Glad that you were able to\nTo to see a that this is all coming together for bed tell when he's able to again teach us I I'm trying to find out the truth\nAnd we're now learning from many people across the country what the truth is which is so far nothing that Beto said has been accurate but I think we're going to find out the opposite very soon\nWell we've asked for people to call us and tell us about their white friends named Beto in El Paso or my calendar whatever border town you live in because I'm sure it's common not just in those two towns but virtually every\nBorder town I Would assume I mean there were white people are called Beto everyone knows that ah yeah I'm so let's talk to\n... ... you're on the Glenn Beck program with that issue\nAgain in mining guys weren't academia over here in El Paso\nIt's good to hear so yeah you have a lot better and I'm like okay\nI actually do have three and my husband is that you know my stepson is that you know and my father in law is also bad so that none of them go by Robert none of them\nNone of them so they all go wait\nThey all really do go by Beto\nNo there really are and that's how I told him this you're going to need back up here pretty soon buddy he says no way that the the three and\nThen actually don't like the name Robert so they go by their middle names anyway so there's no better than my family\n... Roberts in your family your from El Paso and none of them go by betcha none of them do what um what is your what is your background are you a boring white person\nI Am I'm born and raised and I get the question all the time are you military and they say no there are white people here in El Paso\n[laughter] that is allowed they do allow that okay good ah that's interesting I I uh\nI can that seems to be evidence against ... it does we really should report this to him when he goes on national TV and says these things you don't get that check hard today to get a ... day for 'em\nYeah thankfully my gosh oh wow very upset about that so that's well only every person who is called so far has contradicted a Beto yeah on\nThat and that's why like I you know we want to be factual we want to deep deep into the science and that's what we're doing here you know a pat and I both come from a scientific background um and that's why we've always looked at you know for what our one of our examples of courses that's how I Stein who was a great hero\nAmazing things so I ... I Hope we can get ... nailed down um let's see we got burner burden in Texas\nHi good morning I'm having so much fun [noise] there I have a twin brother\nNamed drilled into it as an adult way color and Robert okay or that\nYou do we do get better okay now what is your background are you ah are you a boring white person or something that would be positive in our society\nWhere Americans of Mexican descent\nOkay had his own Hispanic when they mean by ... no ... that I call myself and American an excellent dissent first of all\nMy name is bad but I like to be called burger or get this Bobby\n... wow see okay so you're going to the other way you're going from ... to Bobby which is interesting is I got out he asked\nThat name for forty years and ah I don't like to be called Bertha which is that natural inclination from people\n... and I know that don't personally oh you do I where\nI used to work for the NBA no Paso as the secretary to the director and assistant director when he first started as a came in Congress he's very adamant about helping veterans and we were overjoyed because we needed help getting the message out about the veterans\nMhm [noise] well\nIt was when I came on the a lot of my information because I knew what was going on and stuff is costing my desk and everything when I found out that bad though was running for Senate I knew he had used the veterans\nAs a launching point and they need to them under the bus wow what a\nTo get his name and don't forget his name nationally known by the way my call him personally myself I call him ... face [laughter]\nAttractive dangling\nHe's got that weight Adam's apple and it sticks out for a long time um\nWhen it seemed like an angry\nHispanic female mhm I Am ... an angry conservative and oh I forgot to tell you I had my best friend and she stayed in Albert she goes to them but he never agent ... and ...\n... ... and it's like ... and thank you for the call it does seem like that there is a a a there was an effort made when you when you prioritize identity politics over everything else\nThese things are sensible right like it's sensible that Barry Obama both ... and he is sensible in that world it sensible if you're Elizabeth Warren to claim you have Native American heritage and\nIn in your school and and submit to a ... recipes to pow chow like that makes sense in that world because that's all you prioritize it's the only thing that matters right if the only thing that matters is your identity as a victim\nThen classifying yourself or as associated with a victimized population of evil conservatives\nDoes a lot of good for you there is a real incentive and motivation to do it and we ... we seem to see it over and over and over again\nAnd you know look maybe he was called but it was a ... I don't know uh I it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... the idea that he has put on every single sign solely\nBefore letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him bad health but it is not he's not doing it because that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses [noise] Beto O'Rourke so you can identify him from his campaign Sarah stuff which that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that all that in my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now people pressed him on it he's obviously going to admit I'm Irish American and they come from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ad or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all\nTrying to be a Kennedy right he like he wants to be a Kennedy and a plot you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're ... you're not be F. K. okay we'll know who the F. K. was he's been gone for a long time [laughter] we all know that you're not the F. K. and just stop trying to beat the F ... you're not that he's\nWorking on it though it's dry and these these dry and I mean better ... better Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible person we'll [laughter]\nAnd it was terrible tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing\nTurn of events there and it's good to see it's good to see a that this has got out I I I just I don't\nI don't see how people don't see through this\nYou know I and I think maybe on the left they don't want to because they think he has a chance you know every few years the the the left gift that terrible teeth or they get to get close in for in a few polls I mean Wendy Murphy is going to change Texas was the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a\nOh a where you were to use them and when you're down there yeah ah yeah sort of a moderate leaning a Democrat he was also gonna change Texas\nEvery time they were on somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to it no longer we're gonna have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return to state blue with one forever and by the way that part of it is true if they start they turn ... yeah that's true they will run they will run the country for a very long time if they're capable of doing that just from an electoral vote standard\nBut still it's a it's not ... it's it's a way to suck the money out of small donors were throwing it away you know we keep hearing how bad people have it\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard\nHow insensitive of us mhm how hateful and a downright ugly that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must be as Hispanic\nJak bags ... interesting with that sort of talk it's like you know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic or lend Native American short approved it by going back try to ... generation trying to prove it one one thousand twenty four yeah that's amazing a left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about the blood being the determining factor and these things and they they hate it there\nMay have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is this amazing\nAh but the identifying thing there's two parts of that like I said as a you know say that you know\nThe libertarian side of me right like I don't care what people say they are right like it makes no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there is an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black and it does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way\nHowever we have to be able to stand up for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white the third the truth is that Rachel does all is white and the truth is that Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay [noise] you know people are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the left only embrace his identity politics the tech world we need to cure it\nOklahoma's news radio station one

I had to do that all sounds fantastic and these are obviously really going on there making yeah right like the point of\nAnd it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that you know we one of the biggest reasons Beto is in a in the public eye in the in the United states and not just a Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot at the streets for no reason because for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man of rape and we're just supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race if a male but this is the type of thing that makes no sense\nI mean there

if you want us to reopen dot com\nOr however this goes back to Nineteen Ninety eight here are are the percentages of democratic fundraising in Nineteen Ninety eight they had forty three percent of all fundraising okay uh in Nineteen Ninety eight in the house two thousand it was forty seven percent two thousand two forty seven percent two thousand four forty six percent\nYou've got to see a pattern and have their little been Republican slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and I'm fifty six was outlier most of the time it's right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house while again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raced eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent announced two point six million shoes and this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow we're ... the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race would be a with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean Beto O'Rourke was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz's influenced by your ... made a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world\nUm but I mean he he's raised this doesn't even clue better he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate himself is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was it compares to ... racing and what's your what he wants\nMore in the in the uh if you compare quarter to last quarter of the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than Brock Obama during his presidential\nCandidate that the presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win uh-huh now it's funny in the Senate race record he broke was the what was the ...\nRecord set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running a children's Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race even though Rick loggia wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race it was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win\nAgain ear ... Iran fifty in almost every it's almost fifty fifty split every year and it's you're sixty five thirty five that's a ... um and the other thing that's kind of interesting on the in the bad side if you want to get\nScare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately um\nWe haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days with knowing how we just\nKnow we have a going back in history looking at two hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent\nOnly eight percent of them\nAre getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency race is a little bit more often if you're worried about the Senate there's a little bit of there's a little bit of something there should be worried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're in a sea of fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think they make\nPick up a couple of said oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas are those who were in question ...\nI I think Ted winds up winning by maybe ten points or more I think it'll be a double digit\nI think there's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah for I think that's where he stands right now yeah or Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a ... you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida that in mind set Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top ... yeah well I saw it's close but um they pretty much a toss up race but\nThose other I mean Florida is a complete ... reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to do a rifle junior I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that brand they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski\nJoe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them\nAll of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest conservative of all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because immigrants are now communist again the socialist in communist yeah\nI mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting flooded\nSo so much by the White House and by the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that's the seat and Mick Sally is running for a well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nBut you know again a West Virginia is a state is probably the most pro trumped state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I imagine it's got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know ... you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capital almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota but I mean in in\nWest Virginia got mansion he got his cabinet vote you have a couple of but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls it is an interesting development there\nAre but I did a winnable she'll be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mansion seat you're\nIn a year at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one it would be a real surprise if\nThey lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there's a good you know eighty percent chance that there are the most models that are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota she's gone by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven points to the Republican Kevin Cramer so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my perceived there I think honestly you had two races decided\nBy the cabinet vote one was mansion generally like high temp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose if she's going to lose a pretty big\nI Would not be surprised as you said that double digits situation happens there yeah look again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and you know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is when we got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan\nWe've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator\nAnd there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances with the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far\nLeft figures and good for North Dakota and for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks that way yeah\nYeah there's some uh optimistic things there it could but the dangers there as well I mean this this is going to be an interesting one and ... and the thing that's really unfortunate is if if all that happens is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now which is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly\nYou lose it let's say by eight or ten or seats you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and I think there's going to be almost nothing they can get through\n... nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which still find ways to get those ...
