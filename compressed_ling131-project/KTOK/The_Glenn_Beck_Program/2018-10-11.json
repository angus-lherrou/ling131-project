spreading\nAnd we're like look at this this is crazy well we find out now that that actually is Russian propaganda that never happened\nThat was filmed by the Russians and put in to our system as a poison to get us to hate feminist more say look it out to exactly what we did\n\nWe're going to take you to a story I thought was a joke I thought was a joke where\nThe Russians gone how deeply are they into our into our consciousness what will\nThey actually do is at all about politics Stephen ... friend of the uh a program and a and quite honestly a are probably the biggest Star Wars ... on the planet welcome to the program Steven how're you\nDoing well Glenda\nMorning um\nTell me this is a joke\n[laughter] it's not a joke um there is a study out I'm from Martin bay at the University of Southern California at looks at the role that online bots particularly the Russian persuasion might have played in the discourse on social media surrounding the last Jedi now\nThat might wait wait wait wait wait yeah so you just kind of Iraq by surrounding the last Jedi by [laughter] the last yet ay\nNice in the low hanging target being a star wars movie what do people care about more than politics I Would say that it's probably the light side versus the dark side of the internal struggle and a galaxy far far away [laughter] you know you know you mentioned Glenn like\nThey pray on these very emotional 'em and personal issues on social media it's not just about politics and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump that can be about kneeling the national anthem\nThat can be about something out of celebrity status and an amplified and sort of turned up to eleven so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that category too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this is incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that's by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence in particularly malicious activity coming from the Russian ... trolls our stock puppet accounts\nYou were talking about a moving target people who are deleting they're out changing their information making new accounts staying act\nThey can't actually be tracks to any given location and if Morton ... researcher at us it could prove definitively that these are Russian agents that he should be working at the CIA\nBut he's not he's just a researcher at USC and what you look at is you look at the characteristics of\nSocial media accounts on line conduit to I what I just mentioned is what behaviors did engage in debate speak in all caps what words do they use and then as they are out there the next week when you look up again these are sort of things that you look\nFor when you're talking about foreign influence on line and it might be Russians that might be the Chinese that might be Iranians or it might be some clarity in what the bone to pick with the rest of the country\nSo that so what did they landed with it what did they plant into our society\nWell in this case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen accounts that could specifically be rushed\nLights a hundred and five that sort of had a question mark as to where they could be originating from that are jumping on line when the last ... comes out and people are starting to debate about the movie and then they start throwing in the tweets about the ... not the admiral admiral hold though and then they start throwing in tweets about how\nA masculinity as under assault because ... and was unable to lead the ship and then they started\nRolling in tweets about as jade Wu droid than the fact that there wasn't droid enough I remember those yeah\nAnd and so and but the important thing blended that that comes from real people too and you can't really distinguish what comes first like chicken or the egg did that did the Russian you know ... or troll on line plant the spot in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and see some sort of like you know progressive fingers in the pot but there's also that discourse on line that happens where you sort of amplify\nLet's see if we can get you out of pain to go to relieve

about but not\nThe author is not even the the last word on this is the the post modernist they can take and read that tax any way they want correct\nAbsolutely yes I mean I think that there's a slight

thing has been really\nGood for Republicans in the Senate or it looked really positive we don't there hasn't been enough of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in ... red states where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Ted Cruz going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou mean oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so yeah the point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point I'm a several polls showed cruise only up by one or two\nNew York times doing something really really interesting in which\nYou know normally you kind of see the ... news well I didn't say that they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happens and then you wouldn't even go after right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the resulted in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho was voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addicting to watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I at one point yesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is for them to get people on the phone anymore to take these pools which is it's part of that and why it's hard to read you know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but\nCruz in that poll wound up up a nine point in that one he seemed to be honest when their eyes

look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation that high employment I I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still high on the stock market especially at these low low prices\nRight now so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did\nWork good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise than\nBonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those effects of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we don't see real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth this is\nIt to the fed and and a germ Jerome Powell why you're taking a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash shows a stock market rally\nAnd pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and the ... guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax break and we haven't seen it\nWe show me the information I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we have international trade\nWe have um [noise] you know we have all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and\nTrade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I I my only point is I just think the fed\nActed preemptively and prematurely and raising rates in in a in a way that wasn't that sort I Am a little concerned by the way I'd go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like equivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why is it going up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you\nJust said okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\nTo a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um\n[noise] you know about the price of the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf facts that back on line bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean everywhere you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again\nSo [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just fear you know that's the stock market is driven by fear and greed\n[laughter] that's true is up for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true\nOr this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the bed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's\nIt's it's a a you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on the way the president as his chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct but I I think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or uncles on high at the fed they act as if they're the temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence\nBut they've made so many mistakes so you're going to mention I remember the seventies as you do when we had literally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because of fed mistake and I you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in\nTwo thousand seven and they I keep\nThinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nUh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars a and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think is it Stephen [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that the Arabs are good\nHere's my view I talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I'm using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the the kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals he got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal or where he basically\nSad you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before that the deal had to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and\nThis is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with that I don't know you and I haven't talked about this plan but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheated\nThey're stealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics thirty using on so I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction when it comes to China they let\nMe challenge you on that one or a you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way chop looks at it and I think he's right about that it's like if we can't trade with China we sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy in Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that courage and saying look we're not gonna give you unfettered access to our markets if you're not going\nTo play by the rules I talked to a company CEOs all the time if I knew basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market you got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your trade secrets your average I mean we can't live with that is right I'd write when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't believe they also weren't our bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nUm I [noise] sorry I signed up\nAnd uh my uh sorry my uh my
