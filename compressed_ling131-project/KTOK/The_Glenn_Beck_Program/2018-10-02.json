I can jump right into that role oh you're dead dogs have that\nThey spent on fifth teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how they look at it it certainly on its own this is their fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court safe for all the wonderful or the room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWhat but what it does say when it does say is that it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his\nAnger when he was drinking and the shows that he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I never met anyone reached further I Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI Would have thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with that well ... yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful and as\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here's my levy Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would\nHave done it no other president in my lifetime would have struck a stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said that cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\n\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any\nGround with that being said and I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those those charges turned out to be right you notice you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody like she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out and this FBI they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know\nThat that happened none of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that's by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say\nYou know he he you know quit or vote went down all went down in ... ran down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one\nStand that is likely because you don't need how long did they do take the due to the ... sessions ah ah\nAh I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighth he was the ... went down\nSo let it for weeks and three or four weeks for an hour it'd probably could have a fast rate other things going on case so you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks\nThe one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely it's already been done he's the only under get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list\nTs so so you've got you've got Mike ... you could select him let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which I wouldn't strange accident\nBut it could happen I mean it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy with their fighting on the ...\nYeah I mean was turning around if that happens\nTo Kevin well this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering a the New York times are playing but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes him into sausage mhm\nUh you need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... ... pro life uh and he would vote for\nHim in the bottom line is he cares about the constitution anything I mean it will vote he will vote the

able to prove that he did something or really make you believe he did yeah I mean it was credible evidence if it's it's if it is preponderance of evidence is it you know the details matter but yes you generally speaking yes okay um perjury this\nIs what they're going for now this is what Jeff Flake has bought and what he purchased a was an extra week for the media and the Democrats to move the

possessed with this on ending hatred and there's nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh didn't do it\nYou're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yep no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't know that\nYou cannot know that I mean this is one of those cases where it is so crystal clear to me judge less you be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring themselves\nI don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves but that requires evidence that requires some sort of of case to be made not accusations but a case to be made\nHere destroying a person's life see here's the problem with this particular professor at Georgetown\nShe's looking for social justice\nShe's looking for wrongs to be a to B rice it somehow or another and it doesn't matter all men are guilty all men are guilty well I'm Sorry was Gandhi guilty\nWas Gandhi guilty really 'cause he was a man was Martin Luther king was he guilty\nYou know the both of those men were flawed both of those men had things about them that I don't like both of those men\nUh it had been one was a alleged land or the other was a clear racist gundy I still think they were great men there were just flawed\n\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collective justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil\nBecause of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors when you go down that road you always always end up killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole but today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her saying\nWe should feed their genitals to the pigs\n\nTell me the difference between that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric\nAnd what a surprise once again it's coming from the elites in the universities\nAre in the\n... on ...\nMind that

you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monster is saying X Y and Z and demanding violence so I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so what's the best way to get people to come on our side it's\nNever to point the finger at them it's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\n\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just saw you're crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way\nAnd as I've said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions but what\nAmazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish\nYou do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others please don't do that to others who say you know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are released\nTo make in some sense please do not rubbed their oh well we told you so really remember when you don't do that please don't do that will come them\nIf we're going to heal the nation the first thing we have to do is peel the right we're going to heal the nation we\nHave got to put our differences aside and begin to open up our circle\nIf I Believe in eighty percent of the stuff you

some amazing amazing people uh you know when they were young and and before they got famous and uh it's it's just it's\nI don't know it's really satisfying or one of the guys that I think of off it and then I I have no idea\nYeah why let him walk out the door I'm like I don't think I think I Would have had to block it with my own body which he wouldn't have been able to move but uh uh because he went to go to become one of the founders of the federalist\nA which is a great group of of thinkers uh online he has just written a book called first freedom ride through America's during history with the guns a and his name is David her sunny Hi David\nHow are ya I'm well thanks for having me he said oh I appreciate your bigger guy than people think are no\n[laughter] so uh thank you for that I think it was a fat joke and I go to a a David\nBefore we go into your book here to build and just get give me a minute on your take on Kavanaugh and what's going to happen\nI think he's going to get through and I think um [noise] I think this is one of the ugliest smears we've seen and at least in my life ... covering politics and thinking about politics and I think it's going to backfire and that really brought together\nNever most of the never Trump ... and all this sort of disparate parts of the right\nAnd rightly so and um [noise] and if not I I was listening to before I think the Trump is to be ready for that and they have to push through someone else because the courts especially when you have a divided\nPolitical environmental as you do today the ... the Supreme Court is incredibly important and uh you know his ... rifle seat there for the for for the for conservative and the Trump should do what he has to do to get through\nWhat do you think about what do you think about Mike Lee as everyone knows him you don't need the FBI you could vote in a week [laughter]\n[laughter] I Love the idea I mean and you know he is not going to like wander off\nYou know hardcore or so and I have a okay so let's talk about let's talk about your book the thing I like about your book is that you do not a shy away from America's gun culture\n[noise] yeah I think we talk a lot about the politics have gone out of his guns and obviously it's important the ideology behind it but I think a lot of people miss the culture behind the hundreds of years of of of imbedded culture not just not just in war but in in commerce\nAnd the ... the individual lives of Americans and how important it was and how that is in our DNA and that's why we talk about guns the way we do so because I grew up in New York and in Congress or alien to my you know neighborhood and place I grew up in West criminals had them or I thought it was important to try to figure out what that was about and ah you know that's what the books about\nWhile still so how did you I mean what did you find I I didn't know that you were you know not part of the gun culture I grew up in the gun culture if you will my grandfather my uncles we you know they'd go hunting and fishing and we always had guns around\nA and it takes on a different meaning to me and to people who grew up around them what'd you find\nRight I mean you know where I grew up every you know if you mentioned guns or if someone had a gun they immediately think about it\nIn a negative way something that would be positive so uh you know just a personal story my my data little jewelry store in New York and it was a robbed and uh right after that my dad tried to get a gun and it was\nYou know it's painstaking process of trying to get to protect your own property and your own work and your own family so that's I think when I started turning\nTowards you know they're having a curiosity about what it was about and then when I moved to Denver and lived in Colorado and other places I saw what it was really about and um and how people treated it and how like an NRA members of the most responsible person on her\nYou know when it comes to gun so uh yeah and I don't know if that people\nKnow they don't they don't understand that at all hum it take me through some of the stories that you you talk about because I Would I like about this this is not a gun is not a book about um you know necessarily the laws and everything else this is a story about America and how\nWe we do have I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam colder or buffalo bill who am I ...\n... ... of the most amazing Americans that ever lived I mean not only was he an engineer and and just created this incredible innovation where\nA person one from firing one you know must get shot once a minute or maybe twice a minute to shooting five times in mere seconds he was also just an innovator in in in marketing in selling himself in\nStay away from alcohol when I was first quitting was key\nIn that in ...

happening today happening right now really is unprecedented on air or on demand\nYour smart speaker to play games use radio one south\nKatie okay the conversation\nGuard's here use radio one thousand Katie okay [noise]\nI Would love to talk to you and maybe it will do this or on Thursday um anybody who has read the book and wants to ah talk about it I Would love to talk to you about it\nAnd hear your thoughts where I might have missed it where what you may not understood um you know what what do you think is crazy or what is good\nIf you've read the book addicted outrage can we put this on for Thursday I'd like to hear from me Thursday on radio and we'll take calls on Thursday ... uh just about the book\nYou know given people enough time to actually read it yeah which is nice yeah I think he wanted to do this like the day after I did and everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for a week now and if you've read it\nOr let's talk about it on because there's all there's a ton a ton in their\nI think it explains so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people\nIf you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like all the Democrats are the worst in there and saying but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats and they sound completely insane about this happen often yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know\nPeople who I'm friendly with and the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime\nIn in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the entire effort of logic off base\nIt's based in post modernism huh it's explained in the book and you'll see the times I look at a time like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things just to make any sense and there's an easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories of the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah uh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics\nThey know what's going on they don't they do not believe what they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy and to collapse the system that\nWe have yeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... you see them acting a radically and there's some reason and you don't understand that why would they do this they blow their job why would they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would elect act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight to the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if you're reading and try to finish it by a by Thursday if you haven't started yet please do 'em and uh and then joined us on a joined us on Thursday\n[noise] okay [noise] um we've we've dealt with the the Kavanaugh scenario uh\nAnd it is that we're in an interesting place it's going to come down to whether the press and\nWhether the Democrats tend can Vince enough

again\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some\nIn case before him and he himself was a\nSerial rapist Oh thank you up and carry important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like a judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nAttorney general general attorney general and ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's cause for certain candidate a who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the capital case Neal is a case\nOf the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's one difference on a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYeah she's a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between a word and Kevin ... we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violent okay oh okay that really got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\n... ... words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases are the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor new name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things one\nHas notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll using meeting\nMe yeah and she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos of the incident and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um\nBeing fortunate than have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening then people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between those two opinions but she had named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um pictures and there are those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real time real\nTime and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well it was\n... now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet\nOf course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing that we have to take her word that there is video with the with the bail us with a friend and\nWe don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more and I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Alison case do however
