morning I'm Jacqueline Scott indicating okay new center one more warm day our forecast is coming up\nWhat do you call a group of people two thousand four thousand seven thousand strong marching to a border saying you're going to cross whether the country wants your not while carrying another country's flag\n... what what do you call that [noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one there will be an invasion\nBecause America can't control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match a four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\n\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before\nBut I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing nothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not and we've got two thousand people here\nAnd you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there\nNow if you had a group of people that were marching saying\nThat coming to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing\nWhat'd you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just that you know what they're not common for you know here they are they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I

that's why we should have a border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door and stops all of the side windows and the back door entries\nThe country

program [noise] direction by numbers let's\nTake a look at election by a numbers hello do\nTell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get ball Z with a chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category um biggest polling has been close and now we start to\nTry and move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races\nUh we have moved uh Missouri\nOr an Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident of Indiana the polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz is still lean Republican state\nA ... and a ... a Mississippi and North Dakota are going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican Penn State there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure tossed up still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved to Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling has a lot closer are really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the top ... category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean Democrat\nDate again this is a tough race because you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\n... movement towards about put towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one as a lean Democrat state um we moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat but polling there [noise] yeah [noise]\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling it's closer than I think most people expect there's two reasons in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we moved to lean Democrat as well or was the ... race for most of the time it looks like tester has not enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point er and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's [noise]\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot of started to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around you know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia\nAs well which was a big culprit pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by thirty points\nAnd Joe mansion I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro cabin I'll vote yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hike camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's\nThe majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the ... category but for a week away we gotta pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house\nTerm lectured by numbers\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr don't

I took the filter I took it from the front porch and I said honey\nWhere the hell are the ... where do we change the filters\nAnd she said I think it's up stairs and so she went to one direction I went the other direction some might say\nI knew it wasn't in that closet mhm um and ah interesting and so then she ... and so she found it and she pulled together went out and I'm like\nOh great well here's the new one and she put that ... you know ... does well so you were there I was there well it's interesting when Osama bin Laden was killed fellow al\nEight in the polls are so uh when after the the tape came out and closed it to a much ... you know tighter margin and wound up winning obviously\nYou know it's funny that seems to be going the other way with right now I mean like he's talking obviously about a lot about the they're talking about a potential uh executive order to end birthright citizenship he's talking about\nUm he's been more aggressive right and that that may be good it may not be good we're going to see right now\nI don't think it is I think you\nKnow look you've already made your mind up with Donald Trump and then there there's a point to where he like I don't want any more information I don't want any new information or I Know what I mean I'm I'm I'm happy with the way things are going but I'm not thrilled Kevin each and you just\nHelp me as a citizen I just feel like everything is normal\nYou know what I mean ... and he reminds people in a normal and right before an election that's not necessarily what you need\nThat makes sense ah yeah\nI think that's probably true because he made his strong stand with Kavanaugh he made that strong stand we know where he stands on the border mhm there's no reason to to get continued a dog pile and and quite honestly I I Wish he would stop the\nPresses our enemy I understand what he means and I'm going to be doing some stuff on the press today a that is a ... I mean it they're out of control\nBut that enemy the you know there is the enemy of the people it's just bad phrase allergy yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable I think\nWe have to also back up and say that this is not just a just a Trump election right off the sense that lecture and for individuals in individual districts and there's a lot of storylines particularly in the Senate where you know there's a lot of storylines that could decide it\nI think the issue a overall however uh there's a\nThe momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing more movement or it's dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean they know who knows I mean this doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to turn out\nUm it's just it's not you'd hope to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the it was like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run for\nTrump and Democrats and Republicans remember they you know a month before but I'm an eight or nine points they close that gap\nAll the way almost would pose a so that was not a the momentum clearly showed it was behind a Trump leading up to that election and obviously he won here it's a little bit it's not I wouldn't say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to\nBe leaning that will get out and vote do not sit this election out and get out and vote Mm\nGlenn Beck worldwide Katie okay dot com\nThis report is sponsored by American ...\nTotal traffic studio no major trouble at the current time most of the earlier accidents declared memorial wrote a western reporter traffic still heavy on I thirty five through more in Norman remembered north ... boulevard as one lane only between what's he's twenty first uh twenty third that'll be lasting through January part of the ongoing where\nI'm at the boys owner of American shocked my story of CBD is like many of your shoulder injuring didn't even live my on less than ten minutes ...

[noise]\nWelcome to the program Mr pat gray who ah precedes this program on the blaze radio and television network a and also has his a podcast that you can listen\nTo and download at your leisure ... welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem well problem it's an executive order I agree with though\n[laughter] so you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter] it was another justification yeah it is the justification I think what would happen is it would be challenged parts and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally\nOkay for the Supreme Court to rule on that the ... amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens you know what it's about no this was clearly\nAgain I said yesterday everything after the tenth amendment basically is a read a ration is just to reiterate or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to pay\nThat right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and then I'll stop it yeah here ... ... ... ... literally Democrats knock it off ... yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know a sneaking in cross having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here\nLudicrous that what that was ... and so it's interpreted now all this time right but you can't you can't you do it with an executive no but if he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court on kind of okay with it yeah and that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included\nAnd it'll be internationally there is yeah I see that would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts\nSo he needs to the judges he's put in would now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was going to be fascinating yeah it does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and ah\nAnd Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court just come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe it is that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think\nOh really I mean you can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and we say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes\nOh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play can we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this how far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMake a um [noise]\nYou know in a week [noise] people get to make a decision is is the America they want to live in\nBecause right now the only constitutional check against this sort of important to have your guy really a guy who was sending a message by time and time again tweeting about face for we're talking about his bad hair day there that was done intentionally [noise] send a message\nTo white nationalist says about me that much\nBut I'm I'm going to launch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nNot that I'm I'm not gonna let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become so twisted they well and that's from a hard core conservative yeah showed her daughter oh nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not I mean not at least not at that desk send a good friend\nAnd he laid out all the reasons why it's about to take off yeah\nHe lives in a yeah right now the gas is just a matter of timing I'm All right so here's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in crypto currency it's just this this game changing stuff\nAnd between a bitcoin crypto currency and block Jane that is the future and you need to understand it take this\nGlenn Beck exclusive course right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or coal eight seven seven ... back eight seven seven ... smart crypto course dot com [noise]\nCagey okay is available everywhere you want to listen in on our ... downloaded now\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could add a trio ... one of the leading cause as extra mind out before it's too late with cardio among the FDA cleared personal EKG divide that just Ninety nine dollars to order\nThe Amazon dot com and type party among vets Amazon dot com type cardio mobile cardio mobile fits in your pocket and so you can take it EKG anytime anywhere right when you\nFeel exempt cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone to just thirty seconds you know if your heart rate them as normal for if a trio fair relation is attacked border cardio mobile today for Ninety nine dollars this an Amazon dot com anti party of milk\nTake unlimited ... morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing\nCardio mobile put peace of mind and your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars for your time today\nAmazon dot com and type cardio mobile or learn more cardio mobile dot\nCom this report is Becky by\nThis report is brought you by giving me the pin dot com\nFrom a CBD plus you as a general traffic studio Brian to Denver worth a deer a vehicle collusion reporter there possibly was spent forty people in northwest eleventh ...

that's what President Trump believes considering an executive order to undo the policy any baby born here whether the mothers in the country legally or not is a U.S citizen he tells actually goes on HBO\nLook at look at look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism or\nThey immediately said were racist now when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite that's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is about\nI did I did and they basically taken the position that anybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is\nIs a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so and my wife is Mexican she's had a first generation\nOr you know a ... a Mexican American ... it's ... they\nUse this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and they just hack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous late\nLast waning and you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided only tell one side of the story\nSo you know that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that\nSo that's what I ... it was it was astonishing kind of moment to\nTo call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on is purely because we were conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that the what is it that they\nHave about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by so few people\nAnd it was just such a fear for losing work and one way and it and on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where they're it it's very competitive to to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of the conservative\nUm and and anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets to think of them on conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years\nStart to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know ... and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking his anymore you see the ratings start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new friends here for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red tailed America that's on the eye heart radio a pod cast a shooting I heart radio I'm shooting I heart radio ...\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you\nThe Patrick I'm\nI have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly and thought while she's a great gift she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we have our own\nKind of sixty minutes kind of person\nI'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was released she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her and\nSo they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and in in the entire me too movement at a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um it it
