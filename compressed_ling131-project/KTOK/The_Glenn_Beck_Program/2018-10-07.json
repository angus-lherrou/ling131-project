[noise] uh I've always recommend it to five shot a revolver either cheap special Smith was some are something similar to that\nMhm [noise] it it will save\nYour hand and you're squeezing it's comical you don't have to worry about is it on safety not on safety or is it ... right and I think it's good for a beginner people that are ... wouldn't be asking are but anyhow [noise]\nAll right let me play devil's advocate for you I think ... are harder to shoot a harder to shoot accurately and particularly with heavy loads they kick allowed\n[noise] well it's true I qualified I Would\nCertainly qualify that we might carry it and it was it was a little harder to qualify with a short barrel but I did\nAnd it they'll raise not quicker and it was because of the limited capacity right right\nBut if you're actually somebody who's the experience and then the beginning most likely would as I became more me you're about to graduate up to something else but these little gums how old are you you you can't ah that's true\nYou can either try to keep it for a back up and they can say oh well Kurt pocket or [noise]\nI don't think I don't think it's a bad idea and it was kind of playing devil's that was that I Would say maybe add two things to that one would be if you could find one in the three twenty seven federal chamber and\nYou can get these really light loads for practice and then the full house loads are actually quite a bit more powerful than thirty eight special\nThe other would be and I think this may be the game changer Charles I ask you what you think of this is getting one of these small revolve around with a laser on it where do you think\n[noise] just the men are eating about those that would be great but the but it but for most of the time\nAnd so like they're they're my friends the other part of it is I'm not your average guy because I carry a lot of different ... because of the nature of the work of what I Do\nA you know I may be cured if he's ... three sixty five yesterday I was carrying they get back I Would guess day I was carrying a Springfield ... three point eight nine millimeter um [noise]\nIt's kind of like I'm not sure I'm the best guy to ask sometimes I mean maybe in one way I Am not going to try all these different guns but the other thing is it's I Do it to the wrong way you should pick a gun and carried all the time\nAny given time I'm probably two to four weeks into carrying a gun then switching to something else because there's something new some manufacturers me to try it's like not the best situation before it's kind of get to try different guns\nSo I'll tell you I guess what the bottom line is\nI end up saying you know find a gun that you like I Am not married to one or the other everybody's making good guns find something that fits your hand that\nYou know and you may look at the thing is you may look at the pizza or sixty five and go ... man that's little that's really little and it is it's really level it's crazy

than it should be because that bullet his last barrel [laughter]\nNow if you go the other way it becomes dangerous to be in you it is possible some rigs to shoot at three in a blackout in a two to three and that is dangerous can blow up a gun but in this case all he did was shoot some ... that he didn't hit anything and it's okay and the ... the guns fine he's just not a big deal\n[noise] okay I let them run around her button [laughter] good\nAnd tell him a mark that if you would mark the magazine special max for three and a blackout was like\nBlue tape or something and make sure you

five for eight seven to three three\nLet's talk about some more risks we've taken live how about buying a home\nFor many people buying a home is one of the largest purchases they will ever make\nWhat risk do you have when you buy out for one\nYou have risk of market value lost\nA lot of people learn that in two thousand eight right many people thought that there was no significant risk from home values going down but that perception has now changed\nAnd what about risk of property loss flood fire and those dreaded earthquakes that we seem to have every five minutes around here when storms and theft\nThey're all things that could destroy the value of your home investment other properties you don't have the same risks if you own a car a boat an airplane\nIf you're on an airplane or about my condolences but anyway if you own any other property with significant value there is a risk of loss when you're on something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you probably know the answer insurance right\nInsurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they were probably never used so why\nWould you buy insurance on your home you might say well I have a loan on my home so I have to buy insurance on it well that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for would you still buy insurance I think you probably would why\nWhether you realize it or not you would buy insurance on your home because of something called catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that you have a chance even if it is small to lose a lot of value in other words money\nIf something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our homes is because the cost of insurance is very small\nCompared to the last we might incur if a catastrophe happens so for the fun of it let let's assume you live in a modern home uptick current building goes you don't smoke and fall asleep in your bed you don't light candles and leave them unattended\nAnd you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen if I'm describing you there's a very small chance your house is going to catch on fire even so I bet you have home insurance and the reason is because losing your house\nWould be a catastrophic financial loss so they're relatively small cost of homeowners insurance is worth paying for am I right well you know I'm right\nBut let me ask you another question why don't you have insurance on your retirement money shouldn't you\nShouldn't you call us now for free copy of are a hundred and Fifteen page save money
