October ... near listening\n[laughter] [noise]\nI guess maybe I should have taken off my doctor back in the white jacket or for that amount of ... a month to do I'm Still I still have to do in my care after uh doing a power our\nWas due to to ah to just to to be able to see is he capable of being president or um you know or or Supreme Court nominee and the future after drinking six beers as ... said he used to before he went to college now Bill O'Reilly is here hello bill\n[laughter] back how you doing I'm I'm I'm good I don't well how do you think this cabinet things going to come down\n[noise] are they going to be confirmed um tomorrow afternoon a guy's ...\nAs I said there's the forty at this time [noise] but I I think he's going to be very hard at the ... this last ah yeah for any Republican vote against them because there's new information and I don't know whether you guys know the new information because the media is not reporting it including Fox News [noise]\nMorning the wall Street Journal\nI'm Dr Ford's people that includes her lawyers and uh her advisors or tried to get a woman named ... ... ... testimony that is in the FBI report apparently\nThat ... was the best friend to Christine Ford when this incident about Gavin allegedly took place and was named by Ford as\nAn eye witness ... all along and said I don't remember anything like this I don't even know judge Kavanaugh will now the journals reporting that a forged people and they name a woman Monica McLean\nTexted keys or and said hey you got to change your testimony you gotta help Christi that's a huge story\nWell they're enormous store\nThere is also another story um that are in the FBI testimony that it shows the leak came from Chuck Schumer that it was Chuck Schumer's office in cahoots with one of the beach ladies that Ford or talked about\nYeah well I don't think there's any doubt about Chuck Schumer or Dianne Feinstein at this point that they are corrupt\nSo bill ... there he won more than one language Monica McLean by the way this was the woman who forged ex boyfriend\nTold a Senate Judiciary committee that Ford tried to help her get through a\nLie detector test yep because she was applying for a job at the FBI there's now bolsters the ex boyfriends um account now this may seem in the waves but if the judiciary\nCommittee and I I Believe rationally may do this I Hope so\nHe could hall monitor ... Monica ... uh and uh others in affords camp in front of the committee\nAnd he could bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if that happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I don't think it will I think it should it should be doing a ... to here's here's the\nAnybody Kavanaugh allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nYeah here's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right you lied you should go to jail right that this this is too serious this tour of the country apart\nAnd it a little what if this was coordinated if it and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this\nHe should also stand some sort of penalty but anybody who is involved you know there was one guy who or what was it su he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he has already asked do he's been drinking this morning bill you wouldn't believe\nThe IRA yeah [laughter] oh you have him arrested yeah he'll I like to be drunk for all of your interviews if that's OK rights do I mean is\nIt better state for you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] that's true I I Do as fair so um ... there's there's one guy who came out and leveled accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on four but there's been five accusers\nYeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but when you when you get into a situation\nAnd and this goes right back to the need to think here we're talking about did you see a list so mulatto yes this week day\nIt doesn't matter if individual men get crushed\nIt doesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're into that zone and we've discussed this before your interest Allen is\nYou are now we don't care you know if some guy didn't do something like Kavanaugh whoever it may be and and and you get it in your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to pay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice\nSocial justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation is what matters is\nIs communal justice\n[laughter] that it it is that other people are talking about in the media will never report on is it the same\nIf something goes wrong but I thought that my daughter and I was like you know what I I Would totally\nLeave oh I really my daughters I leave you my daughter's wedding none of the right choice yes\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I don't know why they can't work out something on that um you know there are ways to vote 'em but I look you know if your daughter's getting married or do to get married\nUm maybe they could move the ceremony later and they could but I don't know I don't know but you're right you gotta you gotta family first\nAnd there's no reason why these guys have to be there why are we using Seventeen hundreds technology out of the euro some reason he could be on a phone\nHigh right right and they can make an exception I think but you're right okay what else\nI'm All right well she's believe me I Know on that I thought where to go\nOn that says if you want me to give\nYou so now we got into the ... give us two minutes on on killing the as\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand the evil my mother didn't she lived a very ... and\nRe all your life yeah cheese on me which is obviously\nBut she loved me and thought I was good\nSo they just didn't understand evil\nRight right so we're seeing so much evil in America are we not\nUm you know people walking into schools and gunning down kids or clerics abusing children\nUm Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof this is all evil it centered on evil\nAnd so I wrote ss with an eye on explaining to the reader that these concentration camp guards and the people who kill babies and gassed innocent people were farmers and merchants and and

I was amazed me where you don't have to just go see\nIt in comedy is very subjective so you could love someone it'd be like Glenn check this guy out and you could be like not for me yeah right yeah because comedy is Barry ... subject you can't tell them if you can tell him it's not funny right what this guy's funny to me yeah so that's that's what I've what I've experienced the harvest yeah\nSo uh you know one of the things that when I when I uh was\nI feel like do they tell you it looked like somebody\nDon't you don't get it or do you want to do they do know that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders just like I I look like Glenn Beck I don't know [laughter]\nThat was going to go to a different direction I don't know if\nYou heard this feel like they look like Dave Ramsey with hair [laughter]\nDavid actually really good looking man [laughter]\nAll right this is making me a little uncomfortable I have a new world set or the U.S [laughter] I go to ... and now this isn't helping because those three I'm going into what's going on what I propose to my wife yeah she said no [laughter] and uh\nAnd what do you ... ... ... what year was a isn't the nineties okay yeah okay [laughter] that rational respond to write the nineteenth alright yeah I'm just trying to get an error I'd run out of the others so she said no and she said the reason why is because\nWe don't have God in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God among everything up and she said you don't go to church and I said\nI see you every Sunday after church and every time you come home talking about the people who were honking at each other and yelling yeah they're running the park oh why oh yeah yeah I Know it yeah it's crazy yeah it's crazy how people are in church and they're finding that but they're like they're looking at their watch like on\nThe news on ... ... ... yeah yeah yeah they want out which of these ... these video mountain road rage and the church parking lot is like saying make all these ...\nI make two videos a week and some of them connect and some of them don't just probably like your content of your books yeah sometimes when people are like yes thank you we needed that sometimes you likely your heart and soul into something like yeah\nYou're like what was that one that connected or not that one connected ... yeah 'cause you're I don't think you'd have to be a Christian too or good church going person to you've heard about that mhm from your wife and they like yeah I Know how it goes and they're like yeah then it's just a\nWhat's funny is the juxtaposition of ... that you know God first survivors [laughter]\nHow did you lose it twenty steps away the human\nSpirit wouldn't you say like if you like you see someone on T. V. and they're given a run down and you just go\nThat's not right it doesn't seem right that guy's lion mhm you just know because everyone is a human like you can spot in sincerity and why that everybody loves that is 'cause everyone when people get mad at my jokes at the live show because you're going to come and the whole crew is going to come tonight\nSo to urban couldn't get to and we kind of an idea yet or bring up on ... people people are like stabbing each other they have a ticket to that's what I that's what our goal\nYou know I mean it's a good comedy show you won a few good yes at the ticket to people the\nPeople are like ...\nWhenever I tell a joke it's like a cross the line I go oh stop I I Know you've got a text each other this personally you're saying I I Know like right when the radio when the ... of you and like if there's an interview there like come on it would be real this guy\nLike because that's how he generally said on the show or they don't yeah yeah that's a human\nNBL I feel like I've connected with you 'cause you're like somebody's like talent somebody's like telling us the truth out here you know what I'm saying and that's what people I think comedy is comedy hard in two thousand Eighteen I go\nI think it's way easier because you don't to to cross the line you don't have to say anything\n[laughter] right mhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say the most profane mhm disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but in two thousand eighty we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up in individual actually felt\nYeah that's the only thing left shocking you really are feeling and want to say but you don't as I I Can't\nBelieve you said that yeah oh yeah well I have a joke in my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians in here we're driving down the road and seen that cyclists on the side of the road I Wonder if I just like [laughter]\nLike why is that why does why why everyone vet\nThat joke has stayed in my show for about four years because it every button yeah but what do you have what's at the bottom of that era ... you want to be the person in church that and then the real human yeah is the guy and we all have a dark\nSide yeah ... is the guy now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some direct sunlight\nActually somewhere [laughter] the reason why\nThe the reason why the outrage and the culture and people were coming after cabin are because you were like if if if we can notch him down I feel like that's why the tabloids exist that's why they outraged exist because you'd think these people are above view the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening now okay [laughter] you know they know they're like I'm Better than that [laughter] I'm ... that there was always when everybody started even playing\nField and then you get you know that's what you get rich or famous or
