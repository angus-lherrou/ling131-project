thing because this is this is just outrageous don't you think\nYeah she released this big ... basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO she was ah she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware yes\nA which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won the ... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and ... then they realized hoops he do see we made a a map there this is a serious correction they didn't do see in the corruption but they pay they should have\nA cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one uh\nOne sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself so he got the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of Cherokee\nNow this theoretically right could at least give her a technical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's\nA you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her was stupid to super recipes and pow al ... which is the goal of almost everybody\nIn America how how come out child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's where I'm going all ... I'm going all full\nI I'm I'm just I'm going to I just but let's all complain about the names of out both teams but let's let let ... I don't want to hear how wild out already or from\nHere on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans since\nIt's a tribe to trial it does the I mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to ... ... they just didn't show any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't\nHave any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not getting participating in DNA studies we don't want any DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test\nThe DNA against\nWe have to use people from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well way\nAnd there's the the theory is that they those the same people want it migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she has Native American blood and it's not even what they tested\nA and even that it's it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years\nHe would not show the his Canadian blood fight like that's not the way this works they oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian somewhat DNA does is it shows a lineage of game shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns and I wonder\nIf he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than\nA prominent French disorder or [laughter] it's true it probably would show that\nUh but still it's interesting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and\nFalling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was her great great great great grandmother I think\nA several generations back and um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white now the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there was a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right here and they were able to get away with that\nThere'd be some serious incentives to do that number one obviously why that is true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with ... her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but\nWhat have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she is not\nThat was what I was not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren\nIs identifying as Cherokee so we have to accept that she is so we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so rich I don't really care\nI don't care either but I don't care that she's lying and the people trying to you know she's lying or let me just play looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those you have to get them you know we've got to start making them\nOr I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however you know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my ... my grandfather\nTook a horse of being a full size horse he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he took him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else ... and he took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so\nIn my family my on my mother's side they're big people [laughter] and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the ...\nThe horses kept a jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's\nTrue I got to go in and say it's not ... ... my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing yo yeah\nThis is what it was but it was it was it was not true somebody advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over balls I was her I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told us what you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never lose you you've\nYou've yeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is ... trying to play identity politics if you're going to play identity politics you'd better be right on these things and that's why I Can't give you that I got what it's about it I give you that I got a huge story I mean ... you know we well you know what is a huge part of the story\nIs the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage such as return ally a to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA class a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nDoes it make\nAnd so ... by playing into it she's just making it\nAbout identity politics more and more and nobody cares no people are done with identity politics I'm telling you they're done with it and the the the first candidate and well we already know the first candidate was Donald Trump that said I don't\nCare I don't care\nI don't care what you say about me I don't care what you accuse me of I don't care that's why he won\nBecause he that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't want this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side\nThey're sick of it they're sick of it\nNow they may not like his extreme tweets and everything else but they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we are going to get rid of capitalism because it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers man boy man\nOr trouble especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and that's really great I shouldn't have said Indian it really should be Native American because India\nShut up nobody cares\nWith all of this stuff that is going on in the world\nShut up the issue here is\nYou don't win that twenty twenty primary with twenty or thirty candidates in it without appealing to those activists who do believe all that craziness\nSo and there are so they're stop their hardcore incentivize right who when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the Kavanaugh saying is white ... on TV with you know with the crazy a crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate should not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you moderate how do you go over to the side\nOf anti ... and say hey I don't think anybody is wrong with that ... out your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nCome back close enough to the center to where people are

I I have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm\nSeeing the way the uh the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there's you know when you're when you're into a an organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and\nUm and and that kind of really despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start just going way off the rails and they're they are they're they're the extremist party now\nIt's it's getting so great I mean they used to and it's the same as in Britain by the way the way that it the anti ... their paramount tally kept paramilitary wing here\nOr the media here's the jihadist over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend and then she first language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that now that said we're not still\nThat is what Hillary's said when we go low or when they go low we kick them or Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no L.

but you know again like I said\nTo have more Halloween is yours on the list is fine with me le mans where do you want those are the view\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to the Glenn Beck program\nYou know in the in the book addicted outrage I [noise] I\n... some people who haven't read the book I think that it is about um a\nSurrendering or or just making friends with\nThe left and it's not that's not what this is about at all it's about\nKnowing what you believe and then taking a strong stand but with a different approach because times have changed and um\nAnd they're getting more and more dangerous and I have\nTalked to you about Martin Luther king for a long time or or somebody who wrote a read my book who [noise] um I really respect they they read it and they said a\nYear about a year to a head I'm not sure um\nMaybe maybe because I think more people will look at this as things become crazier and crazier maybe\nBut it's not about it's not about reuniting with the left because I don't think you can unite with the the left the left has gone insane I think you can with a lot of Democrats and I'm not talking about the ones in Washington I'm not talking about political people and talk about your neighbors\nFor the first thing we have to do is unite with each other we have to unite to people people who\nAre or on the right\nPart of the spectrum need to come together we have to come together\nAnd I'm I'm really I I'm I don't like the hey you're on the train or you're not on the train what are you talking about what trained where's the train going\nHere's the train that we should all be on the declaration of independence\nThe constitution and the bill of rights because that's why people came here in the first place people die\nIn the middle of the night in the desert to get here because we have a a rule of law be we do not have a class system you can break out if you work hard you're smart and you're a little bit lucky you can break out\nYou can change the world you can invent something in your garage and become Bill Gates\nThat's America that's great that's why people come here and we're losing sight of that until the first thing they have to do is ask are we worth saving and I think the answer\nAcross the board I'll bet you eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving so what does that mean well capitalism capitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites\nThe constitution but we haven't been on the constitution or the bill of rights in a long time but we do need a rule of law let me start asking you know just a few questions and I don't care who you voted for I don't care what side of the aisle you're on\nJust answer yes or no do you hate men\nDo you hate white people do you hate black people do you hate Jews do you hate cops do you hate capitalism\nDo you want to shout down others that have a different opinion\n\nDo you want to shout down God or hate God\n\nDo you believe screen to violence is the way we solve things in America if you answered yes\nTo any of those things I don't think I have much in common with you\nBut I don't care who you voted for I'll bet you the vast majority said no to all of those things and it wasn't a hard well I don't know it was\nNo no no no no no no no\nThat's who we are\nThose are the people you need we need to unite with but the easy ones to get by the ones on our own side getting the Guinness\nAnd I may disagree on a lot of things we disagree I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge and go and walk through Atlanta FAA\nSinging hymns and let them club you in the head go ahead and let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and knocked punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nThat video will cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America at least still at this point we'll choose good\nAnd uh we almost didn't go because my pain was so bad and I was just so desperate and uh basically give it up it seems like I had just resign yourself to this is just your life ... and I was starting to resign\nI was like I was

has relations with Brazil's a has a reason to be concerned because we still don't have any clarity on how will be a\n... and not as governments to cook I don't know exactly what's coming he he\nGrew up in a time where there was military rule in Brazil and that was that was overthrown a and democracy came and he has him to the in the past that\nUh that's the way you know you should run a government he has he has called for ... ... what are the Ninety nine a civil war um and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians he is extraordinarily divisive but he is not\nHe's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least be has in the past correct\nAnd he's surrounded by military so ah he's closest advisors today are a military base so a a an exception is a follow get just a that is appointed as he's minister of economy\nThis guy is a liberal so we have several different says uh regarding President Trump as you mentioned he's a he's a liberal and he uh\nComes as he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so this is the man\nThat he points out as a the base of the trust in his government but uh he said he uh ... it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling\nOr his advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had later to a unauthorized them so\nUh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very close government regarding the press for example he has been using social media as his basic communication tools [noise]\nDon't ... this is the kind of the same thing that you go job has said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately came in and he started taking over the media and and the nationalizing everything is ... is there a\n... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him but as a military and is it\nWhen you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect here most\nAnalysts are don't see any mediate a risk to democracy as here we'll take office and immediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discuss here at this time [noise] what is expected is that maybe he could uh\nPromote some change in constitution\nAnd it is not clear how he would do it he has a\nSuggested that he could create a council that would create a new constitution for Brazil and that would be submitted to a vote for ah after it so and in a console to two people to a electors in general so\nIt he had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back once he takes office because the fact is that he's not going to debate he\nUh is giving I'm just a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media\nSo he has no conversation from the press and this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming\nBut a analyst most analysts\nDon't expect something so drastic ah right at the time including because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in if from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governance ... he and he will be able to do\nSome of the changes that he intends\nTo but we still don't know exactly what what do those changes\nCome it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\n[noise] uh that ... son ... and he posted on line a while back a photo of him\nNext to ban in and said that Bannon\nSaid he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this uh this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a great part of a bull so not a strategy but a boat so NATO himself a came to public afterwards and said\nIt was fake news that has nothing to do with it\nWhat we know for a fact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ...\nAn expression of this right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's a it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture\nI've had close to the president's at presidential candidates Ken and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow that we don't know exactly at what point\n... Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAnd now at the end of the ... and ... on Sunday twenty eighth and we'll have the final result it's very likely dead considering the current ... we'll be elected\nAnd we are yesterday we had at a recent poll that gave us an adult fifty nine\nPercent of valid votes and headed into that that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one so it's a big ... and and ... poll after poll has indicated that and here's the light\nTo ferry sure of their votes so we we would have to have a new fact ... thing that would it be strong enough to change the scenario Ben\nAnd it's very unlikely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and find out uh some more will be falling out hey thank you so much ... appreciate okay\nThank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history a he has\nA he has a very very strong history of um of dictatorship a love and passion and uh he is not\nA Donald Trump he's not he has time in the governments and he is on record now he says he's a change demand\nUh [noise] you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator\nYou know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil\nThe other thing that is we should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is a helping cobble together this um populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames\nAnd uh what are they what ... what's ... you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is\nTo doing this this is an ally a this is one of our bigger backers this is probably our best friend next to Israel in the middle east they stand against a lot of the stuff that we stand against there are a big supporter now of Israel\nUm we're in a proxy war in Yemen with that most people don't even know that but we're fighting a war in Yemen\nAt their request and they're fighting with us [noise] um they keep Iran at bay we're\nAbout to sell them a whole lot load of arms they also dump money into our tech industry yeah ... right now because of this um they also dump a lot of money into our banking system are they all said that cool or herb\nThat we should say that's OK horrors\nPretty sweet shore okay the or predict says do we know that has they don't ask the or why hasn't anyone interviewed the or about this incident notice how the orbit is a\nShow she stuffed inside of it [laughter] stuff inside of how they ... they hide\nSo um what is the president do what do we do this way you don't get involved in these things because it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business I don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did what he don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it\nCertainly feels different but I couldn't help me quantify the difference here for a minute\nThese regimes are killing people all the time\nYes we know bad things are happening at all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not innocent of these things yes is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on in foreign territory in an embassy is it just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happens to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue\nCan get it can go after a cushion her and and and Trump because of the relationship what ... what do you think\nI say yes on all of that I'd say yes to all of that um I don't think if this guy was a preacher\nNobody would have been paying attention rather did we got one back and no one yeah nobody seemed to care of this one
