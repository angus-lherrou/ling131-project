Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go this dam road runner keeps going getting away\nMaybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros\nDoes every person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening these devices were not designed to kill but to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one now I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out\nThat are looking to change narratives before the midterms\nNo one knows yet this could be a kid they just thought this would be funny again there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up she just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\nThis however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste\nBy noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about it is rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nThat I asked when the president has actually called for violence\nNow you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news is not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate too\nHarass people in their homes their restaurants places of business Maxine Waters isn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the laughs narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force one\nTo deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapist

you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on any saying everything is speculation\nAnd if I Would say Ari ... versus a left wing person trying to ramp everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters and blaming this\nOn Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility to be able to gain it\nWell\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it it it he is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous is this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen\nIt sort of ... when I when we first looked at I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder\nAnd um I I was looking at it and I was like no not really\nI mean it's a plot you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel is what's dangerous and a pipe bomb and explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need you [laughter]\n[laughter] right [laughter] um but there's another ingredient they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it\nUm they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything's spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing a\nLower or somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nRight it had no I mean if you're looking at this thing there is a you know and I've also spent some time and some insecurity all the people that they sent these ah these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would know what I was no chance just gets to them the coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and\nSerious the situation but there was a level of sophistication levels with station because\nHe had sent her or she by the way he or she had white uh sent 'em some of these bombs to home offices and and\nResidences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely be\n... I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out and her bathrobe and her fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from [laughter]\nGet the paper in the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home do they go to ... they didn't have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or stores service at their home price\nThey get older male you you have private security you don't get your money don't\nLike we never opened our mailbox I remember one time my kids went to open the mailbox I said do not open the mailbox don't open the mailbox\nWe have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a political motive but that's a ...\nA political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off yeah the sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you put that on there and why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope glad I'm Glad none of them went off by the way\nUm but it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we\nJust talked about a no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and ... like that because the postal service is not an\nExact science and you can't say no way to offer to point to our right at that time [laughter] what are you timing to you could have blown up the post in it so that there was a photo timer it when it was just probably a digital counter that was doing nothing but that was was kind of funny is the wires are going into that more than ... doing\nMobile home was news radio station or one thousand Katie okay\nThis report is brought you buy true car\nFrom a studio plus usa total traffic studio newer accident south and I'm thirty five northeast one twenty second south I'm thirty five thirty third north on forty four north of airport road north ... by forty south than thirty five north of second\nAlso very slow going still and many areas of I'm forty four due to the rain and earlier accidents rotating total traffic\nLooking to buy a car online shopping can be confusing not anymore which route price from true car now you can do the exact price you pay for the call you want and see what other people pay for it too when you're ready to buy a new a used car is it true car to enjoy it more confident car buying experience\nInstall a complete train heating and air system from hailing company for zero percent financing or up to Seventeen hundred dollars in rebates\nThinking of it is money you could be spending on pumpkin spice everything\nTime to time ... ...\nHi this is ... with ... what are the suffering from pain friday depression arthritis PFC chances on CBD compound hundreds of our clients have already found\nRelief because an NFL around this we offered the highest quality position recommended product and bombs and above capsule snow couples and mourn or all of you can see as the receiver freeze CBD massage with purchasing any sixty\nNine leader model that tried three NFL among McCain Seventy nine thirty north me having a baby don't\nGet me now that that did you get past this man\nGrand always tells me I worry about him to my ten of going I Do I'm In a\nWorried when he came home and he came back move it wasn't it when when you can see it when the phone\nPost traumatic stress or what\nNot paying her sleep gamers angry all the time\n... in any way and\nWhat the Trump Administration may do about marijuana after the midterm election with me leave managers this afternoon at five news radio in thousand Katie okay [noise]\nGlenda and I'm just looking up on my a leftist anarchists cookbook a that was put out a by the left\nAnd the Nineteen sixties and seventies about pipe bombs and you know it's really interesting is um uh it does show how to make one you know with the clock or but it also shows how to make them you know so they go off like let's say you\nOpen an envelope ... you would pull a string\nAnd that era in that area which would make the bomb go off [noise] I'm I'm trying to figure out welcome to the program Patt grave from pat gray unleashed um I'm trying to figure out\nPat what was the timer timing to\nEither this is the worst bomber of all time in human history or there's something else going on here\nBecause you would you put a a sticker\nOn a bomb like I ... I\nGuess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I guess in theoretically possible but if you know of bombs going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and\nSugar ... and less and less again potentially a you've thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the right\nWing meat yeah right like almost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nThey put they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you want metal as your as your shrapnel you you you wouldn't put glass in the bomb would just disintegrate the glass even more\n... you you don't want it in PVC pipe you wanted a metal pipe because of the shrapnel\nThis is just it's there's just too many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented ... and ... that was the end the stupid or it might be some kid that thought this would be funny it might be some\nYou know mentally deficient\nA right winger that did it\nIt also may be somebody who was on the left is like\nOh I Know how to change the narrative could be that two of\nQuaint don't know I mean you have to have some level of skepticism of the of the of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you leap to that is it's not they haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you'd be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing ... figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think if someone who is opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figure look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be right then and just white powder\nWide someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened a hundred times unbelievable someone just listen to this I suppose he thinks the\nCommunist didn't set fire to the ... dog as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point what you see these statements that have come out from CNN\nAnd ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe right and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George sources how well no but I think a virus that might've [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're going to you you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America feels that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical I\nHi Willa yeah we'll look into that yeah oh my yeah then to look into that and do we want to work to do all the work unless you reap\nThe benefits yeah yeah yeah [laughter]\nFor a trivia is tomorrow at ... least

babies they're sick of this\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics\nAnd the last place probably the last comes first\nAcademia [laughter]\nOh you should be coddled the slightest thing upset you well that's not American\nIt's not we're the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains\nAnd in a um a in a wagon train\nOkay is she was she looks like a million address with a bomb it okay she she'll she also\nKind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\nYou know she did she wiped her face and\n... and kept going she didn't wine she didn't cry about it she's like oh crap [noise] shouldn't around with that I poked\nMy eye out and she moved on that\nTo Americans are yes\nBad things happen we move on yes people say things that I don't like we move on yes things have changed were involving we're learning\nNew things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\n\nMegan Kelly ought to know blackface is awful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what if it's a costume that his purpose flea ridden a ridiculing\nRace as black faces done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly\n... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words and I the ah\nQuestion it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people\nWhy is this wrong that\nThat person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume\nWhy is this wrong I think that deserves an answer instead\nWhat we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't\nBeat me are you kidding me how are we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist\nIf she doesn't\nWell we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nAnd this is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thoughts crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't thought of something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crime stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat\nThe party says that ISIS heavier than water and trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter\nAnd here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say it's not the kind the world we want to end up in unfortunately not enough people read anymore you should because it is exactly the world we're creating [noise]\nAh [noise]\nAll right I Want to talk to you a little bit of other sponsored it's one eight hundred flowers dot com one eight hundred flowers dot com wanted on her flowers dot com or the reminds you that you know the holidays are coming up\nAnniversary bouquets or the special uh but you know some of the sometimes it doesn't take a birthday sometimes just want to send flowers and its most meaningful when it's for no reason other than I'm just thinking about you and I love you\nSending a blue ... okay

has an exclusive twenty four four twenty four offer right now\nThe N. word right the N. word\nWhen said by someone carrying a torch in Charlottesville we all understand really bad mhm when Chris Rock says it\nNot so bad why because we know Chris Rock motivation is not because he this terrible racist we know in Charlottesville the case is that they are terrible racist or in the ... been sorry for the city of Charlottesville who now if they're named just sit on to this with racism but I mean we don't we are talking about here\nThe the if you have an All right figure you have Richard Spencer you have some hardcore racist saying the N word it means something different and the motivation is different and that is important\nLike it but I Will say this it is still I\nI don't care who says the N word I think it's disgusting word I Do too I don't I don't like that word used by anybody but you don't get drunk out of society if you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows that your motivation is not this deep hatred of racism and another example it's always sunny in Philadelphia\nIs a is the longest running a live action sitcom in us history\nIt's fourteen season it's going I signed up for the fourteenth season\nAt least once and I think twice they've done entire episode where they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember\nI don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny in Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they they have a situation where they all wake up one after getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the animation feel the same types of things happen because they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is\nThat he he's that they're not trying to be racist an upstarting Chinese say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who thinks they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nAnd they don't want to be damned don't mix right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well and you think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true\nWe may say as a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to just some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation is not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way\nAs she loses her gig over that I mean it's just completely insane and we are not adults if we can't handle that level of conversation Mm\nDeal gays mail delivery where you want to listen in on our ...\nThere's the outcome or twenty what's new today

there was a [noise] a very there's one individual uh in Honduras or who was\nThe victim of horrible\nPoverty and violence likely from a capitalist ... and decided to just post on his Facebook page and\nThere was a grassroots effort to uh to to have a migrant march and these people who all of them one by one hundred percent but\nIt was Seventy five hundred people or fourteen thousand I Would say I don't I was fourteen thousand he's at the top fourteen thousand people in in the United in the world are they are they're the best people the top fourteen thousand from one to fourteen thousand in the entire world they're marching up there and I'm Out of the ... just to show\nA how how much they they love America and they just want to participate I Want to share in in in freedom and the American gathering I Do think I could get fourteen thousand people who\nMarched across the United states mhm okay march across the United states for\nYou know any reason [laughter]\nNo I don't think I was fourteen thousand people in the United states capable of of this large yeah\nI don't think so okay you're talking about uh you know Seventy five or Seventy five hundred to fourteen thousand people marching what's left twenty six hundred miles mhm okay so that's not just something that everybody is like you do that\n\nNow what's really going on is this is all politically motivated and not politically motivated here in the United states has has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans this has everything to do with the politics\n\nBetween Honduras Venezuela Cuba and the United states\n[noise] we've been outlining this now for the last few days and nobody seems to really want to pick up on it but we'll continue to tell the story because that's what's really happening now last night I got this in a as has during Mr Beck\nI live in Honduras on the island of road ten\nI had been watching and listening to you for about five years now I Am a native Honduran and I've been

came in and then he was going to change the constitution exactly the way Hugo Chavez has changed the constitution and made it into a a a dictatorship so the Supreme Court\nSaid the president is acting unconstitutionally talk to the other branch you need to arrest him an exile him the other branch did so two branches of the government ousted him said that's not what we do\nWe don't want to be a Hugo

a lot more talented than he is Steven Kobe or does very left wing a poll and Mexican mine was comedy it's everywhere you look and and these people have talented staff comedy writers during their jokes where I'm was Michael Moore's ... you know he was funny for Columbus is\nAt the time but he's he's not really funny enough to be a standup comedian as we as we saw his basically stand up comedy show a Michael Moore and Trump land which cannot twenty sixteen right during the weeks before the election he's hoping to sway the election to Hillary\nWhen you when you say in it when you say like we saw\nUm I don't think you're yet you should be careful with the use of the week 'cause I don't think I don't think I could find two people maybe you and I don't know who else in his audience might

basically I I think they use audience that used to go to movies I remember\nColumbine get a lot of young people in their twenties or real excited about that movie uh they've forgotten about it maybe they moved to undetermined chemical and compare a Daily Show and all these other alternative forms of comedy and\nUh you know Michael Moore as it is you're not really funny enough to be a comic\nAnd okay so so you are you saying that it's just that he's not funny or that a is there anything can be said\nFor uh the fact that uh this this kind of stuff uh\nYou know you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not he's not the rebel anymore\nIt's just not you know he was\nAnd we're a rebels you know a lion and we all got to you know we're all in

moment at the end of star and hide eleven nine where he does is Hitler montage and trying to say Trump is like Hitler and it's like if you're playing the speeches of Trump and Hillary and that's what everyone's been saying Trump is like Hitler on the left for about three years\nIs like the last one to the Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of where the culture has gone because we have a ... at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even when we talk about with Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no co sponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate\nAnd they're not just talking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where we look at candidate\nAnd say that to socialize nation does not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah head as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left pointing that\nOut that we're calling for an end of capitalism\nI mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know we're socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an\nEnd to capitalism and they're still getting elected to\nRead like worse than in the

Nashville has some ... and I that kind of thing is not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far less\nSo what does that say to you does that say does this say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at the time was seems like\nGehring Lee far west but that's that's about ... to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff that she really stay out of this open borders stuff they should stay away from a abolish ice they should stay away from Medicare for all all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the polls\nAnd the Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest position since the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding which is astounding for the opposition that it is had 'em and the the the flaws or that it is that is well it's it's amazing that it

people up\nThis election is about tax cuts\nAnd I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that's what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just dog whistles set
