rundown of the week so far and we have a lot to discuss one of them is Saudi Arabia this story is just getting more and more bizarre\nLet me bring you up to speed in case you don't know\nThe story started a couple of weeks ago with this idea that this Washington Post reporter is suddenly missing well he's not a Washington Post a reporter only\nHis name is ... and uh he is a Saudi Arabian citizen\nHe is also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood his beef with Saudi Arabia in his own what he called self imposed exile is all about\nThe Saudis not to be friending and not um or not excusing the behavior\nOf the Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis are very clear that the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization and not a friend to Saudi Arabia or really any one in the world\nSo he went into self imposed exile a and he came here to the United states\nThe there are claims that he is he he was still a Muslim Brotherhood operative there are also claims that he was feeding us information\nUh uh uh uh against the Muslim Brotherhood I'm not sure which to believe at this point\nSo he's overseas he's in Turkey and he is going to get married but he's been divorced to his wife in Saudi Arabia for him to be able to get remarried he has to have a a divorced certificate from Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudi Arabia and say well you're going to have to come into the embassy to get it now he is not a friend\nTo the Saudi Arabian prince the one who is banned this big reformer and he's going to you know take Saudi Arabia end of the future and he's good for women and he is good for human rights and everything else\nIs shaggy is not popular with that prince and that prince has not been popular with ... the he had been trying to get Chicago as a ... to come back to Saudi Arabia but ... I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though she was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\nMm but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is is coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly\nOr last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead um but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a\nU.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation torture and killing\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this act\nItaly audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch and when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true for her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists\nIncludes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... an conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n[noise] this\nMay be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia where currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of more machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of of ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nIf this tape exist and this tape comes out we have all known\nThat Saudi Arabia is a bad place but we have not heard the screams\nIf this tape exists and comes out people of the world will for ever think of Saudi Arabia and put them in the same class as stolen as Hitler as Mabhouh or as Kim Jong ...\nUh in in uh\nNorth Korea but we remember North Korea's crimes we only have sketches of\nIf this tape exists\nAnd comes out it's a game changer that could destabilize everything will go back into the story in a second\nFirst let me tell you our sponsor he's won eight hour one eight hundred flowers dot com the first

need to make that decision tomorrow no we need to make sure that we get it right we need to actually figure out all the dynamics going on just because it has a media ... today does not mean we need to make a decision today are we actually take it seriously look at the facts only a media ... because it involved a reporter\n... yeah and and and the story is so dramatic as you point out what was it wasn't at first Hitchcock movie yeah rather window right where window I mean ... you know it's such a dramatic\nHollywood type crazy twenty four ah you know Jack Ryan story that you wonder I mean it it's capturing our attention which is is okay it's just that we have to make sure we're looking at where the stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make Saudi Arabia look bad my guess is\nBecause I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things I'm this prince ... I mean getting remember this prince took his own you know family members other princes hostage in a hotel and is likely a stole tons of their wealth\nIncluding planes and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking their remains out in suitcases so these are the\nPlanes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know in a you know rich Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia it's a lot worse than it is happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we deal with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure\nTo not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kind of ... around and calmed everybody down\nAnd then when everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're knocked friends of ours they are not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it\nWe don't need it open up\nThe fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it [noise]\nWill watch this closely a it's a ticking time bomb ...\nOne thousand new king\nThis report is brought you buy true car\nFrom a CBD plus he was a total traffic studio many slow down on this dry morning in North ... himself himself he's been seen the big delays their north I'm forty four south of eye to forty north forty four north of airport road north\nOn forty four at southwest eighty nine west bound to forty east divide to thirty five road\nGames on was looking to buy a car online shopping can be confusing not anymore what drew price from true car now you can do the exact price you pay for the car you want and see what other people pay for it too when you're ready to buy a new a used car is it true car to enjoy it more confident car buying experience spend an\nEvening with four remarkable American heroes the Patriot tour comes to Oklahoma City Thursday October Eighteen\nJoin Marcus Luttrell retired Navy SEAL and author of lone survivor tae a Kyle ... author and widow of navy seals sniper Chris Kyle retired Navy SEAL and endurance athletes David ... and retired army Captain John Fleming for this emotional\nUplifting live event the patriots or October Eighteenth that civic center Music Hall ticketed patriot tour dot com\n...

million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance humid received the full inherent as the three hundred um this is an important moment or in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take any assets I couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right he had a zero after it's at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing where you do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend up like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right around so that kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from that on was the idea in in a documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually and it's just a spoiler alert for Nineteen eighty three but how did he\nWind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all it was somebody at a so I think

chair or as a mother or you know was a source of all of\nThis but look I'm getting back to to Beck's a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is obsessed oh yeah\nAll right so she didn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there\nBecause she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't rough initially she\nYeah she's a system a Paul would they call in New York She's a Paul so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes\nOr I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what they may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what is up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg\nIs going to run for president of the Democratic ticket\nAnd you know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg is very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm ... and older senior citizen\nI I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for running I don't think in twenty twenty but I think the only twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has at the drive but certainly she would be formidable and then there's the rock and it's the it's\nThe reverse you know ... they're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPer year does he you know I'm not sure you need the ah the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I were to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\nDrop is smashed that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right it\nMight you know this was in her time the next time around I just want to go up against Trump a certainly doesn't want to do that but into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to about I'm ... and what is going on in the streets of Portland more with Bill O'Reilly from Bill

get my soul mate see I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose that\nThere isn't a an uprising or in Portland or

Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want dogs on the streets in mass beating people up and telling women that there has been shut rotten the grave we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians at the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to you

combat\nThe frustration is growing in America the press is excusing or antifa they are excusing everything that Democrats are saying uh than another Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and said\nIt's time to bring the guillotine out for the Republicans I'm I mean it's it's it's ...\n... what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets you um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] well I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper\nOr with five hundred signatures are attached to it\nSo the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have um some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing because that's almost ... possible\nBut I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the sauces really essentially about and and a lot of people still want to look\nAway at it they they don't want to engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most and arts elements in our society the press sympathizes with all of them they\nSympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes and there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes so\n... that's a big difference we didn't have that what was left wing press but we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say as a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen\nSixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody\nElse will take a cell phone video and throw it out there\nJust what happened is that an over the weekend is that in the group\nDoing that would have to hire security\nThey'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes it takes leadership it takes organization\nBut but on the press thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes you solidly still try to do with\nTrump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia All right well they want to\nNot trade with them they want to crush\nThat nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad\nOkay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad but Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran in the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed herself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good\nBut the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that and then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all of that and then you turn around and go the unintended consequences of that\nNews radio one thousand Katie okay [noise]\n\nHi Michelle I'm often hear one of the biggest outrageous I reported on the trial

rolled often embankment which he kept him call him and says it happened about seven twenty this morning on state highway Nineteen about five miles east of Paul's valley\nThe most grotesque terrible thing you can learn how to do this why why were all these people executed in these people were executed because they were leaving the caliphate these were people who had been wet endure more than likely the full three years of the ice occupation in Mosul and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there\nBecause as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolute health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by the ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there\nUm and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and and it's it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that and and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into decided they can't run away because you know they looked like me are white guys read ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care at so\nYeah so you went from that um to say and I I've got to do\nI've got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to\nBurma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update forth\nYes absolutely so ah also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from ... or ... you were telling me that you\nWere trying to organize people yes and you were going to bring them all\nTogether slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago and I met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to have been as or infants help okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist okay I'll all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their ... or done several trips with the ... in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have this because when I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and\nFifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the Burma Army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground\nHelping keep people alive so why why are they doing this why are they doing this to these tribes [noise]\nIt's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic burns who control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma\nThey want to control all the high lines they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject or surf class you have to basically serve the ... and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know Christians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're the spirit lord as there was liberty right and these and so because of that\nThe Burma Army attacks them even more tell me what you wrote me so I brought I brought with me several photos have somebody I'm over ... they're apologizing for

on tour here soon and we would love to see you grab your tickets now to Glenn Beck dot com tour were coming to a theater near you it's Richmond and Hershey Pittsburgh Cleveland Kansas City\nUh Tulsa Tampa Orlando and other cities around you make sure that you grab your tickets or you can do to Glenn Beck dot com slash tour or we're going to see if you\nCan spend as much as a democratic socialist [laughter] it's a game show that I don't think you can win no no I think we all lose in the end and you know the sad\nPart of the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of this here it appears\nIn Texas where NATO O'Rourke or Robert Francis or if you know as his parents wanted him to be known 'em is\nGoing by as he used to call them so called right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself\nThat All right so Beto is running here in Texas and if you don't have and you haven't seen this you haven't been watching a any national media as far as not just politics I'm playing outside of that Ellen and cold there and he's very where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him\nAgain it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars\nAnd going out there who have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we know this could change but\nThe well they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nIs the margin now with cruise leading by seven points this is from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with better tonight CNN as their poll same thing to forty five\nI think he wins by twelve\nAnd maybe as high as Eighteen I made that would be a real surprise uh no it wouldn't be but you know that's when I mean is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe or believe the polls here in Texas\nYou know it'd be great if he won he won by three but I I just think that there is is something that ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I ...\nI tend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think that the tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for ah governor here in life and this\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is there I don't have the one I'm right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's so much he's up by age Eighteen points here so cruises by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll\nIs it the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um\n... it's a great read country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nIt this way try this on for size\nAh a Donald Trump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a free leap pad inside and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh it luckily not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or a big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job okay mhm I'm", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city":
