what I Do uh even though I I didn't\nUnderstand the weather from Youth Radio one thousand Katie okay\nBeth Myers and the Katie okay new center we do have severe weather in the area that has spawned a tornado warning and we want to take it to a new sport for the very latest\nDiscounting listened very heavy rain as well and chatting with the national weather service here and really continuing to the evidence that there could be a tornado here again this is a radar\nNear lake found a bird\nDefinitely could be dropping a tornado at that time very weak tornado cell in the need to seek shelter immediately and also I go ahead and costs and uh people in the town that that the Lakers and in the town of pink\nShelter immediately as well and this could be dropping a tornado already or if it doesn't it cut at any moment I'm going to go ahead and loop it back again and that's the area of concern just whacked the bank living off to the north east or west they backed up were were trained with Christmas Day that's very good so\nTornado warning Athens time continues heading towards\nThat the Lakers and paint get over the lake Thunderbird area\nAnd we are also tracking other severe thunder storm warnings that's important to note it's not just this area of the entire line of storms and this isn't the only area that can create that kind of situation like this happens when there's a line of storms in a falling out and sometimes on the edge of the world can happen and the credit little small bore attacks\nWhich can drop a tornado so the line of severe storms those from Adnan cashing down through an ad men all the way down into our tornado one area and you're paying\nAnd that extends all the way down through Stratford down through sulfur\nExtending down to ... go into king fan and the tail that's a line of severe storms producing Seventy mile per hour winds and also a men's flooding so heavy rain already moved there the metro hoping very heavy heavy flooding eastern side the metro announcing that had a friend had men as well\nAnd of course we are tracking this tornado signature located whack a tank that's moving off to the north east and\nPicked it out to be really click it the cat ah Chris where's your current location [noise]\nAh in South bend in more right now are trying to figure out a way to get a east over there to see the uh you know the area that's affected by that tornado warning a traffic north down to thirty five as you can see is is just gridlock\nSo you know right in the middle of rush hour of a strange time a day to you know tornado warning\nUh but yeah I'm just trying to get down to that area right now and and fight and rush hour\nAh but as soon as I can I'm going to get east and uh get over that area\nHave you noticed anything with the flooding ...\nIn terms of trying to hold up any flooding and planning on running\nIt's luggage agent you forty or thirty he's pretty good shape and ensure that you owe it looks like a red in this area and rain that the ... crazy\nAnd\nI mean ... pretty well show them that you're listening to a different story with more ... than the ... you know ...\nVery good very good thing for that report while he's trying to get there right now are the areas circulation it very clear now put on the velocity is located just northwest of paint it looks like a circulation about across east spell a road\nNear Ardmore uh down freelance some downed power lines in southern Oklahoma and now we're just starting to get reports of damage in Midwest City um in fact\nThe news that is listening I think we should send a crew out that way it's Midwest\nCity ever were already heading out they're not perfect enemy need me to tell you okay let's go ahead and take it out to Chris ... who is tracking the latest he's trying his best to get out that way towards the two areas of circulation but rightfully so traffic is pretty intense right now this is a busy time of day a lot of folks\nI'm having to work for a later start and we're also dealing with\nFlooding in area Chris what's the latest\n... different factors together with the traffic and the flooding into being rush hour and\nIn a very odd time of day to get tornado warning system sure everyone is where this is all the way late afternoon touch the show and you're trying to get it to a desert circulation of Northfield sooner road right now\nI'm going to get up to the the two forty area a legitimate damage and Midwest City as well because these are the circulation or just racing to the north east show a you know it's it's it's pretty challenging last year to try to\nDrive matrix George George W whether it would you have all these different factors that are that are adding up there but you know this doesn't look too that the traffic and I'm going to hit up there or have you seen the uh\nThe trouble is still strong over choked off are not able to get rid of right now\n[noise] um it's definitely still there right now I'm\nAdded expect for these type of situation of pulses up and goes back\nDown so I think it was his strongest as it moved their Midwest City and talked to announce pulled them back down again but\nI you know tornado watches just issued crafts and we believe that this line of storms will continue the same type of situation where it keeps producing these a brief spin out in circulation is along the lines cell and\nGo ahead and had that way and we know you're on top of it will be checking in with you\n... get up there are\nJust had a ... situation it smell like tornadoes in may work you know there are there any more predictable and a little easier to see and things like that show ah yeah these kind of tornadoes are very brief they're they're kind of like noodles in Asia you know when when you have a\nSituation like this they had a lot of challenging is the challenge but um I met her given it my best shot you'll just use it but I'll let you know\nThanks for that appreciate it it's all we can do right and you're right about the needle in the haystack let's take it back to radar so I can I tell you if you're just tuning in right now maybe you're hearing sirens going off in your town I've learned that eastern side of the metro\nSome of the sirens will be going off we have to tornado warnings at this time and we have several severe thunderstorm warning of what you're seeing in the light green this is a\nTornado watch that goes until two pm today\nSo here's the situation that's going on we have seen that before\nIt is a line of storms and sometimes on the outer edge of the line that can briefly by which causes the circulation and can briefly proper tornado we've already seen that happen you're like Thunderbird\nThat tornado warning continues and it is heading toward Shawnee at the same time we have another one and that one's located near Choctaw and Midwest City and we've already received some reports of damage your Midwest City and that is moving off to the north east near Chandler\nAt the same time we're still watching the rest of the line because a similar set up could easily happen where we could have a brief spin up along that line as well and that's why the tornado watch has been issued so this is not done yet we're far from over a\nAnd like Christmas and kind of a needle in the haystack problem is if they spent up happen very quickly they quickly drop the tornado and then just as quickly as they spin out\nThat I buy down again and then a new area circulation forms threw me keeping a very close eye on this but we are watching the two areas of circulation in addition to that we've had some very heavy rain and flooding moved\nThrough the metro so I Want to go ahead and do not end for you to the two areas were concerned about [noise]\nOh we have\nThis tornado warning that continues for this area moving from painted towards that the Lakers and north western side of Shawnee it would be a brief split up and then moving off to the northwest we're also tracking that other area a possible circulation that's moving through Choctaw into hair\nAnd pushing off to the northeast we have another area over Luther that's moving towards wealth and so we kinda have\nThree areas were concerned about right now let's go ahead and take it out to the Kevin Josephine\nHe is now on the field for us our\nTeam of foreign trackers continue to watch the latest adjusted the where are you located right now\nWe're only right now in that case in Broadway and and and had some ... earlier but it's all this stuff just moving through at a rapid like I won't be just on the western side to that line of storms\nThat it pushes on through metro but some people need to be aware you know be caught off guard just wanting to know something like this is going on or you know someone who uh who may not be much whether we're going to give them a call and give them a heads up about this stuff you know had no idea I'm breaking toward it trying to get into the thick of it and the arts and stuff out for you back to you\nThanks for that excellent report Josephine we know you'll be keeping an eye on it so I'm\nLooking at the current circulation I'm\nNear Luther let's say let's zoom in twin Luther and hair and you can see it moving through um near all his John ... the last week a team coverage yeah hey I can help them help\nOkay moving down the line we're also tracking this other areas circulation that we're concerned with on a northwest side out in the clouds and you see that bright shade of red\nThey're moving into McLeod that's going to be moving off to the northeast and that's what we're concerned about and eventual a that could be heading towards a ... jak town\nNorth western side of leaker\nSell back in and out I'll want to point out we are tracking huge areas of flooding\nThe big concern we have seen around the metro four to six inches of rainfall in a short period of time and you know the ground saturated from the flooding we had last night so flood advisory continues across the state\nAnd we also have a flood watch continuing also this was just issue we have a a tornado watch that has now been issued\nFor eastern Oklahoma so this is a nice overview of the line of severe storms lining up from Stillwater all the way down\nLine it's we're storms all the way down through our war and John once you're done come over here and if you could drive the right offering me that'd be great um looming and you can see the line and blowing out their Luther all the way down on what the shiny as well um\nWe're about to have a another tornado warnings issued for the ... area [noise]\nThe line just keeps going through an attic and here's why you have the line of storms pushing east and then you can have the\nAreas of circulation forming along that line\nAnd here is a line of storms from Guthrie to Luther to chopped up all the way down through for the everything's moving off to the northeast pretty rapidly Ron thirty miles per hour and on the outer edge of it and you can have a brief little spin out so thankful that\nWe have the two tornado warnings right now I think we're about to have another tornado warnings issued for that to come to the area\nZooming in you could see that's why we're concerned about the circulation that is heading towards wealth and so wealth and whether or not there is actually\nA tornado underground it doesn't matter and want to treat it like there is a tornado on the ground and get into that same spot right\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] she was born in orange county to county\nTo county we find him and we learn from our expert\nOn the phone for flying debris will be on the show which destroyed\nLargely\nShort [laughter] [noise] interstate forty the moral Warner's wife wanted\nTo take over now so strong shoulders sturdy billboard\nSecured doors to the show because you're so close to shore birds for\nOne week here between production on billboard says\nThe situation each of those Boeing segments are allowing for these areas of circulation along the line and this is a unique situation this isn't something we see in may where it's clear cut you've won super selling the drop the tornado it's not like that it's a lot messier this was\nIn the morning with a line of storms we can have the same thing happen at night as well and it briefly drop the tornado\nOr at least forms a funnel cloud and then go back up and then a new area of circulation can happen [noise] All right we have our crews out team coverage and we're getting reports of damage and Midwest City we have Jessica Bruno ... what's the latest [noise]\nYeah and we we just got to the parking lot here this is a shopping center right across from KCUR in front of the j._c. Penney's let me show you what we're seeing onstage just seconds ago these cars were completely toppled over\nAnd they just flip the cars looked like about three cars that are Mitch I recently spoke with the fire chief ripe a breach in our lives shot and he tells me all they know right now very strong winds that quickly ripped through the area about twenty thirty minutes ago or so so obviously a very bad damage there to them because\nI haven't had a chance to see 'em a steep with any witnesses that doesn't sound like anyone is severely hurt but again we just got to the scene so I'm going to try and get some more information and keep you posted as we learn more but yeah I Know we know right now it's very very strong winds that ripped through this area and we will send it back to you\nAnd you just saw some of the damage and this is unfortunately what we can see from this I'm also getting similar reports\nOf that happening and love county with sun damage to homes in that area so sadly that's aware of and expect out of that I Wish I could give you even more lead time it's not the case in that situation so\nWhat happens is you have a line of storms you quickly get a circulation of briefly drop the tornado at the same time I mean it's not too different than the damaging winds possibly out of some of these severe storms because these tornados are likely going to be on the weaker side and they're going to be short lead\nThe same time out of the line of storms you could see Seventy miles per hour winds and this is not just the three tornado warnings were concerned about we have this entire line of storms from Stillwater\nAll the way down through to rant and then we have a tornado watch that and now than it should because of this line and that goes all across the eastern Oklahoma until two PM so ah on the other box here you're looking at some of that damage that Jessica Bruno was\nTalking about and we have our foreign trackers out monitoring the latest as we are watching this line of the charges off to the east\nSo John let's go ahead and take it out to a radar or velocity to take a look at the latest especially want to see the velocity mayor to come to and it's a shiny area and that seems to be in the ... most robots circulation at this time so zooming in you can see this\nTornadic storm over shiny moving off to the northeast if it holds together it'll be moving just south of prey so let's go ahead and switch over perfect to velocity\nAnd you can see actually two\nI'm concerned about here you see that flavor yeah OK let's going on in to both of those so we have two small areas right now that I'm concerned about do you see that so um let's zoom in to this one over\nThere you go perfect and this one\nNortheast a shiny you can clearly see the green\nAnd red meeting like that that it was obviously a broad area circulation it tightens up anymore I could drop a tornado at any moment so you need to be prepared now this is going to be heading towards the town of garden grove okay let's move\nFarther south that new area of circulation\nAnd here's another one very small scale that just popped up boom so early for all\nYou need to get in your safe spot immediately because same deal this could quickly drop a brief tornado this is\nA safe area to drive in right now along this line of storms okay I thankfully it looks like the majority of that has passed east of ice thirty five of obviously I thirty five other very popular thoroughfare this hundred days busy time of day where people are dropping off the kids to school and may be heading into work late\nIn addition to that if we're going to be looking at some flash flooding potential still out of this powerful storm system\nAnd let's go ahead and take it out to one of our ... we had a Kevin Josephine just be where's your location right now and what have you noticed\nThat I Am but just a on the eastern side of the movie theater Jones on high voice or he just starting to get in to have you know getting up on the western side of the wind is already pushed through the metro area\nThat's below falling on the roadway don't you just did not heavy heavy rain more of a mistake and rainy so lightly but to push further up to the or the nation's struggle to get a lot of you write\nA lot stronger when invaluable budding what you're talking about along this why do people in this area just the way to go to like ... ... what are we going to what to do anything wrong with emotional area and they go hand in a big ...\nFor that just to the and we know you are definitely monitoring the latest for us\nI Want to go ahead and take a wider view of this system really quick [noise]\nBecause it's not just the tornado warnings that we're concerned about plus at this time an update we're just tracking to tornado warnings okay\nSo the beginning of this line it goes into a mobile home it's going to be eventually heading toward Stillwater they lose it been off to the northeast at thirty miles per hour we have the tornado warning that's heading towards a\nCarney and Chandler area that's moving out of welfare then\nTwo areas of circulation now that we're concerned about what this storm that just roll through Shawnee that's moving off to the east and in the same time we're moving down the line you can see how it goes all the way down through Asia extending down through the rap and we've seen that\nA reports of damage and Midwest City but also in love county damage home's power outages sell their situation developing a tornado watch continue for eastern Oklahoma all the way until two PM so I'm keeping an eye and seeing if there's any more reports um\nOkay yes we've we've had the damage reports of our crews on that one and I\nFlooding the huge concern is while still we still have several flash flood warnings that continue across the area [noise] um let's take it out for the latest too um I think we have alley and we see with some updates from the metro yes we're hearing about\nSeveral cases of the damage and downed power lines as well one of them is one hundred south was one hundred nineteenth and may we're hearing about from downed power lines there as well as a trampoline that has gone into some power lines are in the twenty four hundred block of south with eighty first we know you're on the city fire department is on the scene of that\nOne as well as the Oklahoma City zoo they're having some damage to the tree so they shut down for the time being\nCareful as you drive around town and our number of power in lights are or traffic lights are out of power some of them not functioning properly we know Hefner an Easterner the problem spot for the traffic lights they're also importantly about twenty five hundred\nOklahoma City metro area OJ any customers without power out this hour you may be getting this broadcast signal on your cell phone\nIf you haven't done it already a great time to download one of our family of free apps we've got four warn me and case for we have lived interactive radar on those apps and a great place to stay plugged in especially when the lights go out of your house\nThere are a lot of folks around the metro area also that are getting in there say sponsors we have a number of active tornado watches and tornado warnings Emily something that's been tracking those for\nUs and I'm just hearing or just in my ear that they are also some downed power lines in a coma park\nI'm so there are probably some customers over in that area without uh any power right now and we're hearing about several reports of damage in Midwest City of course we've got er cruise just Bruno is on the scene in Midwest City to this isn't a JC penny parking lot a rat cells is twenty ninth street\nFive cars are damaged here some of them were completely flipped over\nFrom the storm so we're getting some more information as you can say they are putting those cars up and taking them out of the j._c. penny parking lot and I know injury so far reported and definitely no injuries reported here at the shape the penny parking lot but\nWe're also not hearing about any other injuries reported so far there are some accidents on the metro street so we're still getting some more information as the storm is\nWow that looks like the bumper either that vehicle or maybe a nearby vehicle it into the back windshield\nIs difficult to say some times where the straight line wind damage your circulation damage we definitely know there was speculation involved in this line of storms has it moved through a wrapped in rain looks like tornado damage and emily's you're plugging in and looking at this damage that that was a lot to me like tornado damage what do you think\nSuddenly plausible in this situation\nAnd this is a unique type of severe weather situation we don't often see this um it actually happens more often than you think you may think it's damaging when's that went\nThrough your area and they could have been a weak tornado it's just a now we're getting better at identifying this kind of situation often times though it can be comparable damaging straight line wins and a weak tornado and the damage can be very similar\nBut yes that easily could have been a pre spin up because the way this has set up it's a line of storms split up into these little segment and sometimes they bow out and create a brief little spin out\nAnd so they don't last very long\nThe downside to it if you also don't get in a lot of advanced warning they've tightened up very quickly there is not a lot of warning and then I back down again so this line of severe storms 'cause all the way from Stillwater down through Duran without a report that damn it's not only in that area but also located near Marietta\nFor eight hour we had a line of storms that produced a tornado so a wider view again I like to have a wider views and see the broad scope of this this line started I was watching it during rising China eight thirty AM storm started going severe right over Oklahoma City than the entire wind turned severe and sure enough we had\nThese individual line segments within the main line\nGoing out and that creates just enough low level spend to help\nProp ... a very brief tornado and create damage likely you've been looking at unfortunately and hoping everyone stay safe and so that's how we say with severe thunderstorm warning you don't want to mess with it I Know we're in Oklahoma the standards are a little bit different don't expect to go outside and look at this type of tornado it happens to quickly it's too dangerous\nSo he should be doing that anyways right so the tornado watch continue for eastern Oklahoma until two PM as we are monitoring this line of storms a three hour shows how it crossed I thirty five and that's when it just started dropping tornadoes\nOr potentially dropping tornadoes LA's producing circulation where tornadoes or possible so here's the first tornado warning we're looking at moving into Chandler moving off to the north east uh this hot a possible tornadoes signature near wealth in earlier\nLike I've been saying all morning what's typical of this type of storm give a brief circulation it tightens up and then it goes away and then we have another part of the storm that were monitoring moving farther south east you can see this bowling line segment actually has two areas of concern as it moves through the shiny and Johnson area and\nZooming in to the two areas of circulation one moving through garden grow a that one is showing some signs of weakening but it's still there and then we have another one near the town of little now will continue to move up to the northeast everything's rapidly moving off to the northeast so let's go on the lawn and even closer\nThis one is still holding together that we are still seeing rotation so this could still drop a tornado located\nNorth of garden grove south of Belmont talked on the town of Belmont and it's gonna be moving north northeast right\nTo pray pray you are still in the line of fire here for this possible tornado I say possible because oftentimes it doesn't hold together easily could pull back up and\nYou saw from some of the damage it doesn't take much you just have to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and you can be caught in the line of fire moving often se we have another area that we're watching north of the town of little getting a little bit more challenging as we're going further away from the radar but we're still watching that circulation closely and then moving down the line you can see\nHow this continues a severe storm from sending all all the way down through Alan towards topic because I Know we're focusing on the tornadic storms but\nSame thing could happen along the rest of the line right you can have a small area bowing out and you can have a quick circulation so that will be possible here we saw it in southern Oklahoma earlier not necessarily a tornado but a possible week's been up\nNear the town of Marietta where there have been numerous reports of damage damage homes down power poles of this is charging through ... and ... as well so let's take it out to one of our teams trackers we have Kevin Josephine he is monitoring the latest round the match our Josephine where's your location\nThere really are you know I'm a joke a home on almost

digit number [noise]\nA number that would have to leave written on a ... posted belt and passed over to me with a handful of others as part of a kind of warm up exercises the seven were just sitting down to begin our conversation as you hear me read all the numbers down to the group several weeks ago that\nThree ten pet or why why\nKeep in mind one of them is our answer forward [noise]\nLet me start by telling you about the seven I\nYeah and and the high school teacher a mother of three boys three teenage boy I Am a entire instructor\nI was a police officer in Arlington police can continue for thirty seven years\nI wanted their politics to be very very different\nI Would be probably considered a constitutional conservative\nI find the older that I get the more progressive and liberal but I become I Am very much on on the side I always vote for the person that scares me the only I\nEven wanted their experiences and feelings about guns to be different\nBy itself yeah shot done in the closet cans or not he had a shotgun I'm I'm a retired navy combat pilots\nHave guns in our homes that are locked out I've never seen them I don't want to see them last me I started shooting I just

that dumped up with that and then the impact what happened because of what was set so content as we search for the list for almost four hours\nI'd like to share with you the three biggest impediments we came up against because in this new era of communicating and communication I think there was considering remember same children same goal\nImpediment number one opinions outnumber people I Do realize that in this age of unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation\nListened to the following exchange between two mothers\nAnd I'm a progressive and Mona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people's opinions and perspectives are brought into the mix other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear and\nOh you don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restrictions on myself and it's kind of and I'm not saying this is my job I think it's kind of a debate that's been in place\nReasonable ideas we can come up with that I'm going to inconvenient\nBy and you're right there are probably solutions there and you are reasonable\nBut that the leaders of the movement or not reasonable I that's why is that when there's a school shooting or last shooting someplace stuff first things we share\nWhen Ethan control and they enter a is a bad\n\nSo many other opinions and voiced his most of them extreme jumped right into our conversation on mid thirty nine and reaching much heightened from the get go\nBeneath our firearms instructor

from topping the ones that are out there trying to send a message because for me I think it's the wrong one and it's not productive\nI became aware very quickly that it's almost impossible to have a productive conversation with so many other voices\nReference to repeat it how can I get each person just to speak with them [noise]\nBut it would take a while\nSo let me tell you about our sponsor
