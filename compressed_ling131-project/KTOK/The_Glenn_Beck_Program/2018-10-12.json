Need my divorce papers from the embassy\nAnd so he goes over to the Saudi embassy he tells his fiance weight in the car I'll be right back she waits right in front of the embassy hours and hours and hours going by she's calling his phone no answer on his phone he's not coming out she calls the embassy and they say oh I\nKnow he left he left just the oh he came here and we gave him the papers and he went and she's like I've been sitting outside well I'm not sure if he went out I'm Bill did he go on the front door yes so\nFill in the other guy mock moods says yes he went out the front door well CCTV cameras show that he didn't ever leave the Saudi embassy at least by the front door\nSo [noise] the next thing we find out this was yesterday as the Saudis um the Saudi prince\nLands of gulfstream his Gulf Stream it at the airport there I'm In turkey about an hour or so after the guy goes into the into the embassy\nThese guys get off the plane with what appeared to be a lot of empty

just a real quick you know I don't know maybe the chef needed at the embassy but they needed a bones saw\nBy your bones saw Oh thank you so much now we can have soup and uh so they get the bones saw\nGod only knows what they do in the embassy but they're seen leaving about an hour later with really heavy suitcases they throw them into the back of the van they throw them on the jet and the jet takes off\nMeantime the United states says we do have a we do have\nA an encrypted a messages showing that the Saudi prince was trying to in trapping more tried to trap and get him into the embassy or get him back to Saudi Arabia\nA and today and I don't know if I Believe this because it's turkey but turkey says that they have either given to the United states or shown the United states this video and audio they say they have surveillance in the embassy of him being questioned\nAnd then tortured and then murdered we don't know if that is true but that's the latest today so ... we're going to

go to um a smart\nOr do we are pushing through a major arms deal with\nSaudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and they're probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but ah it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole

Melania Trump\nYeah I mean I don't see her I'm In a position where she's being vilified on a daily basis by the press they sniper at her for a long time I'm very charming woman a very intelligent um love shoulder and\nUm I think she's done a very good job as first lady and there's really no reason to disparage malaria Trump\nYou know ... my breaking point was last week when she was over in Egypt and she was over in Africa yeah and the the photos coming back of her were beautiful I mean it was a Ralph Lauren photo spread and all the press could do was if\nThey published any of those photos or they just tore her down for colonialism and all this crap\nErroneous I Know uh and then here she is where the hang on the most beautiful woman in the oval office with the with the greatest style since Jackie oh they love Camelot and her style she was on the cover of every fashion magazine\nBut no fashion magazine we'll put millennia Trump on you know of\nCourse she couldn't go out to their cocktail parties and all that\nIt it it there you do your commentary on the political correctness the eight percent but back in ... you left out some really big things could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I play the media in at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the ss which came out on Tuesday and in that promotion I'm basically saying\nThat we in America are seeing a rise of hate an evil and I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that I tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they sent they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him because she was a victim of something\nAnd he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct\nAnd media matters within a half an hour says that I compared the woman to the third Reich okay now that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened to Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West\nWho I I I didn't really made um I was in an elevator with him at Madison Square garden went around me I'd short pants on I mean he was brooding right okay so he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings that's why they do it\nAll right so tiny goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one likes him and he ... he he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live okay fine\nUm then because of that Trump invites them to the oval office work ... walks in with the hat and and uh does ... the president or whatever they did\nMhm okay now why isn't anyone chair\n[laughter] thank you for sale CNN and his whole day yeah I Know he's talking about what do you want to buy\nKanye West right now Taylor Swift she comes out against Trump All right and she's told everybody in Tennessee that gets them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard back the answer is no I don't\nAnd no one else does either this is a tremendous example of political correctness that tiny Kanye West is going against the PC so he must be vilified\nSo I Want to go I Want I Want to come back because you I Need to get maybe you should get a cup of coffee in or something I Need you to get a little a little more animated here bill car but when we when we come back I Want to ask you about cars you follow ratings\nThe ratings are falling apart let's look at the numbers of you know from like ... uh and and others that are running in the Senate the numbers

All right to bill O'Riley a last question here on on this stuff tell me about the press and the numbers\n[noise] okay so what's happening is not just in cable news but it's in all kinds of TV watching is that the machines are now overwhelmed the American public your devices whatever you call it the church and started it they don't watch television anymore um my kids used to they don't anymore\nAnd

on your on your book thank you let's uh let's talk about um you know I Know why you wrote this book to two parallel and show the parallels of evil and how that can happen um but I'm I'm I'm fascinated by the stories that that you tell in this\n[noise] let me tell you to know so your listeners will understand what we're doing here and there was a concentration camp name ravens broke\nIt was for women just women and it was north of Berlin and nobody ever heard of it\nOf course a concentration camps were kept away from the German people they weren't spotlight it there was no ... were a news report Taj and the third Reich you did what they said or they put a bullet in your head or you went to the concentration camp so anyway at this concentration camp it was a young woman named ... half\nH. U. T. H. and she had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ... did and she terrorized women\nI participated in heinous crimes against it\nBefore the war she was a seamstress\nAnd went to work and came home and had a ... or whatever you do in Germany okay\nAnd then all of a sudden she's in a black uniform I'm killing and maiming and torturing other people are free off after the war ends ... comes to San Francisco alright gifts to San Francisco on a refugee visa in\nNineteen fifty nine alright settles marries a Jew\nEverybody in the neighborhood loves her ... and nice woman fifty years later they get\nThe state department finally tracked her down sends her back to Germany where she still alive Beck and every month gets to the United states Social Security check\nIn the day and it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we [noise]\nIt came upon an idea that we're going to separate separating from Fox they said to amicably separating bowling and Fox are ethnically separating\n[noise] um and I looked at it\nOn that day as a as a new beginning go start and go find another job somewhere and life's going to be great and you're going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do and Clinton I I Will\nTell you that I ate whatever was written about me was false patently false and it was a lie it never happened in ... no one has ever ever\nCome forward it was all anonymous sourcing\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on to go find another job this could the soup on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mud for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to dinner that night\nAnd we're celebrating the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations new start\nPending I drink on the way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang I was a young man on the other side of the phone saying Mr bowling call for sun co Eric right away so what's wrong is just cleric right away I called over there and I'm a girl answered and her name was Kayla he had been seeing her on and off she was crying and for some reason I just went right to um\nIs he alive\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] she said no [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]

day and realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to to create awareness around a opioids\nAmerican bought his antics on campus [noise] [noise]\n[noise] waste with ... ... ... so yeah so that was that day [noise] uh and\nSo now we are a year and two days after that\nAnd it's been Roscoe\nYou we can stop at any time if you don't want to talk about anything so um [noise] but I think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive why we're there indications\nOr was it just a bad feeling feeling out who gets called ten thirty at night and it's told the call your son right away without explaining why and I had a hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with fat and all it wasn't a prescriptive antics he didn't know the past and was accidental overdose\n[noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I ... at that moment I had no flight need to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close and we spent the better part of the next year\nJust talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that it's an epidemic excuse me and a and a ... parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a\nMassive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one pill can kill you and not sure what you're taking the parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to Atlanta to be exposed to potentially dying from an overdose\nIt's

...\nUm and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw um it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody\nNo matter what side you're on the opioid thing I mean I I um I got an emotional whole yesterday from somebody on the TV show that said thank you for speaking up for opioids because there are those of us who\nWe cannot live without them we can't pay for this woman said because of her disease she can't even sit up in bed and she's bed ridden\nWithout the opioid there are [noise] you

R. T. V. thing but he's doing a two hours of for us every day tell if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] now that are just moving in with pat when you say the second best one here say they have had it he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number two [laughter] how moving that I understand why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do\nYou know I we actually talk about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them\nAh because we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided and were arguing all the time because we're not arguing at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the fart factory uh of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convince for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs and our neighbor over there we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend and I am perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself a doctor or a diver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had Dave Ruben who else a stew here recently Michael wrecking walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but I'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody who\nIs who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain\nPeople right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress serious\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand the distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd liberal in a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAn enemy if somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you literally game with you or an office building with you are and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and a leftist that you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God's says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore and the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are the outside outside of\nThe Haiti arena I agree that there are you know I see people\nPeople think that I Want to have conversations\nWith you know I Want to you or you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't talk ... she has no interest in she has the auto industry wants to end you want to share a country where the best it's the best thing is\nIs that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped\nUm and that's dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen share pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd wrote the way it happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheating wannabe kid of the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people what they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed we wouldn't bring it up when we got together as a family has gotten away everything funny things happened the last few years they'll guys she's bringing it up now to me\nThat she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all or any later I Can't I Can't and ... do you watch them never\nExcept for when I'm On the air that yeah yeah for a new India it unless it's ...\nHang on just a second I Want the audience to know that's unheard of in our business that you could not have done this job grief without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... long form it's just toxic ingestion and that the vast yeah my mom watches a lot more of this she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant woman\nBut one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election and she brought it up she started bringing politics up to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nMe away while I'm and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine ...\nThinks that Medicare for all is okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fight we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with that stuff\nSo I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the Reagan\nPeople on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help\nAnd so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like we're not communists right and so we have we have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nThey're completely ah issuing\nI think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change a say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this\nLeftist no movement I I think it's the latter ... and I think that um\nYou're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the rights that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't going to have any repercussions whatsoever\nAnd now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nAre and we are we're we're not even I don't even think we're polarized anymore I think we're Balkan iced if you get the reference to I'm making here\nSo okay let's let's pick it up\nThere how do we um how do we come come back and ah how do we start reaching out to the people who actually do have\nMuch more in common with us because they do believe in the bill of rights even though the people in Washington may non back ...\nNews radio one thousand Katie okay streaming live twenty four seven at Katy okay dot com\n[noise] are you feeling old low energy low sex drive maybe you've truck

[laughter] five I Want to share your hand lead\nTo you're gay\nGlad that Pakistan [noise] so I talked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh and I and I asked the group\nIt\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they didn't hide God three times and their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm\nAnd you are you are seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ...\nPeople don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating the Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because it is it it's looked at\nThe clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them\nAt the table at the moment is or a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you write in\nBut I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative mhm and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our ... that had decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically and so they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive isn't isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is if this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own it cleans the allergy where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removes the God the government will become the God and that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't\nIt the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation\nWalk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and the kings seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan and say this okay say I'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes sure where in ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor you're you're attacking their idol this was not mere political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement this religious fervor you're dealing with the loose it sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation dialing the understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] they couldn't be short were they so they can\nTranslate that into human language and I I I\nThink we see that with global warming with a with their reaction to abortion within this Robie weighed thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... ... is\nThis is pale as his\nYeah they if they don't necessarily know or they don't know it but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children [laughter] he wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permit skew is sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the girls in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nNothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period whom himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in the New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff that would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that what's the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange the truth for a ally so there's one big macro truth in in the universe", "show_name": "The
