[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nI um [noise] I got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one\nWho interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford she was the she was a woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend she well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years\nExperience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Brock Obama's head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was per rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year so she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in her expertise is\nOn old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any it's CNN it's not going to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists\nThe media this is absolutely devastating\nTo you I Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying she said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor\nWould bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for profit institution but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this\nUh this poor woman because she was a girl ... yeah Iraq Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility I've been with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why it was leaked in the final hour\nBecause every one who saw this knew exactly\nWhat it was now she explains why she says\nFord has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\nYou are looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this this this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session list the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attacked changed to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late teens\nSixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen you're in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\n\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years\nIt gets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged hack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out\nThe early Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph then\nFinally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post for narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor what was supposedly one of the most traumatic andme important Nick at events of her life\nDouthat dental at the Oklahoma covered with comprehensive benefit plans for individuals

J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on there's about a half hour ago\nThat the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believe he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community and they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nAnd they all know it yeah so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and and let me tell you I think a\nDoctor's poured who testified she's a serious person she as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so\nThe fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized or to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence and then\nWhat you're doing now is that they're moving the goalposts right I\nI saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about ah well you know he must have drank when he was\nIn college or whatever who cares but it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like reading at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who has not lost his footing ah with with reason um\nSo the address people address people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes and there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper right there you have to go by the evidence in that case you have to evaluate a cases based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are justice qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right\nAnd there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented his exculpatory right there the guy's calendar clears him right\nThe testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to cast at a side and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic\nWhere we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's knocked\nMe this is in a court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made with zero Robert of evidence zero independent\nEvidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happened to four times so I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to\nBut what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of the country has never met Nat right so we're just going off of your city right now and based off is they'll memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person you had\nA serious drinking issues it's not Brett ... we're we're not nominating mark judge of the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them politically or ideologically\nAt the same that's what they do and and and banana republic spending third world countries

because you were you've had kind of a rough childhood\nYour your dad was black your well your mom was white and they weren't married he was in the sixties\nThat's not a popular thing moms moms family she was afraid wouldn't accept you is that how it started that's true okay tell me the story from there\nSure um I was born in Manhattan I'm as you as you said biracial parents and my my biological mom didn't take the family would accept me so she put me up for adoption\nSo uh my bicycle father was not in my life so I don't know um what he was thinking but that he wasn't in my life\nSo I was very lucky and I was adopted by a biracial couple um my mother was a ... who was my mother um was German and met my father who was black and the army in Germany they brought me to the south Bronx\nAnd that's where I was raised by ... stadium and you might know in the seventies and sixties when I was raised this was not the best neighborhood um so that's where I was raised a my father was a corrections officer at Rikers um the jail here in New York City and my mother was a waitress and then worked in a bank\nShe then I left and we all we left together we we rate got enough money so we actually are packed up it was out to Long Island when I was around eleven years old my father finally made enough money my mother we work hard to get that we got out of the the bad neighborhoods you got to Long Island and when my ... my father died he died of\nCancer and when he passed away it was very hard for my mom because how old were you I was a twelve okay so when my father died um my mother's down there was a Europe and that basically abandoned her for leaving and my father's family um abandoned us also so we were basically now\nI'm at that point it was very hard for myself and my

the entire state and this is common in many areas right New York's new state is so very we have mountains is as good as Colorado farm land as good as the Midwest we have lakes we have rivers we have we have Niagara Falls we have New York city the biggest city in the entire nation we have an old and my state\nHow in the world can that be run by one city it's impossible I Want to allow county has to be counties and regions to be regions and people to be people and it's totally fine the issue becomes why do I want to enforce my will upon you I Want you to be as conservative or as liberal as you want to be\nPeople tease me and say Larry you're from queens how do you know you know what's right for upstate\nI don't that's the point and guess what you don't know what's right for me in Queens either\nWere even how would you be you you let me me me and we can all be free to gather\nWhat a ton of work it has words\n[laughter] that's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York where do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are a plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen at present but if it's in the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be with you when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nTo does not just a Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is is that the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even come in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats and Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties is supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government now they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] man will be a massive\nA massive culture shock within within the uh the state of the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay for things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state\nWashington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nI next that the credit culture of transparency because the problem with the government is now is they're enforcing the kings well\nSo they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what does that I don't know I Know\nI Know it's I'm not sure it's an old ducked down due to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we sort of the way while ago yeah [laughter] but yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met or individual businesses that individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally\nYou know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community we don't do that well in New York said it all we have things called regional economic economic development ... corporations which Albany which is a capital gains decides where the money is spent\nAnd opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow 'bout instead the county's can start to budget to zero so they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation end through lowering spending\nHere's one idea that those both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that Britain's named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights of the bridge we retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass it up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all\nThese companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they ... twenty million dollars on a stadium name that she was on the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area\nAnd hundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn a law that taxes hang onto the second Texas New York populist the taxes you listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter] I'm slowly\nBut he has the best part now we have them do maintenance again we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is
