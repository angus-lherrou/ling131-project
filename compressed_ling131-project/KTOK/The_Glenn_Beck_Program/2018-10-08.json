their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are ... are headed out when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows other research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it now we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again if I favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes where there's no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou know that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the creepy line I'm about how\nGoogle has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda\n[noise] um and then uh how they have ... you know\nThat when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where you were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and\nYou got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrectly you have absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the U.S almost\nNo one was aware that they were saying biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study or could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability to shift people's thinking and behavior\nWorldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted\nThroughout the world uh you know and and and that was they had the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results have felt like a news story than just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um\nWe'll send in Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that this is the this is the system that they would have\nDreamt of for propaganda\n[noise] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can ways big tech can shift millions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA\nThat's just one of ten ways ah that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they are I mean some of these the effects that ... that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they were ... years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what\nPeople are seeing while they were using a that Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system as it was a first ever\nCreated and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who am I favored by the way as you mentioned\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty blatant that's pretty extreme wow or sees leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nThat we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time will actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh you know our issue we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at\nMore than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which Glenn\nIn trouble [laughter] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm ...

their sorry\nAmazing okay let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last\nSeven ten ten of these\nThat you're following or can't altogether okay\nOut an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick begin\nVery good when ... here we go this is called path as the er the search suggestion effect and when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type so if you type a depending on your history\nAnd other things chances are you'll get Amazon right away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source\nBut beyond that we've learned through our experiments that Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split\nWill buy one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh\nOkay we're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have\nTime he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the ... the line\nIt's a new documentary the creepy line dot com the freebie line dot com Mm\nBlend back then is news radio one thousand Katie okay\nThe biggest music

asked mind control or the threshold of mind control doctor\n[noise] [noise] uh well we've been here for a long time there's a you know ah there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than\nTwo point five billion people soon to be over four billion a whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected are dramatically uh every single day\nBy a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nI I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election you are a Hillary Clinton supporter\nBut you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were trying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's the only one way we then have the search suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the target heart that\nSure targeted messaging T. M. E. we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect is really scary ah this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to\nBut if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November\nTwo thousand sixteen is is that morning and mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders uh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that wasn't even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others but if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day and in addition oh four hundred and fifty thousand votes\nNow I've got a I don't I I don't think he did that because you know he was very over confident or you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not\nI'm I'm a I'm a moderate in and independent but the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data\nThat that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes and think about it no one knows if it's something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't that what targeted\nAdvertising is all about but it said targeted advertising though it's competitive\nBut I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive\nSo can I mean this is so dangerous\nUm and it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has envision forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally\nYeah yeah yeah oh no you're absolutely right they have literally\nUnprecedented power or to ...\n... it shifts to people yes shift unstable people's shift anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power or one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their\nIt's time to act and secure in emergency food supply\nI use my patriots apply and I recommend you do to a two week food kid will get just started this week it's on sale for only Seventy five dollars when you go to my special website\nPrepare with Glenn dot com or coal eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three the food get includes meals that last up to twenty five years in storage order now eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three or prepare with Glenn dot com [noise]\nListen to Katie okay twenty four seven Whitney I are draining downloaded now I'm Katie okay dot com [noise]\nHi Michelle milk and hear the gods now movie opens on October twelfth dean king and the entire cast her job bringing this during the big screen\nHow the woman goes into a funny comes out of there is no police report you might be worried\nAbout the movies too scary it's not the mother of two I promise you can bring your teenage children to bring friends and family we have a unique opportunity to change hearts and minds of ocean don't miss out\n... perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history God's know rabies leads you thirty\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked but you've rates go down\nYour rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about on certain three year fixed rate loan scholar cost information and conditions sequel housing winter licensing office takes animal is number three thirty initial conditions or exclusion may play\nOr are you feeling old low energy Los extra maybe you've tried supplements pills or even another man's climate with no success on Dr Charles or a coffee but universal ... where we specializes in treating the rental dysfunction notice tossed with modern medicine and the leaders put ... or patients experience a high level of care motives improve the quality of your life\nCall us at four zero five nine for two thirty one hundred that's four zero five nine for two thirty one hundred border visit universal men's clinic dot com\nGuys if you're a patient of another ... clinic and would like to experience the high level of care ineffectiveness at universal men's Clinton call us we will transfer your care and treatment free of charge as a leader in men sexual health and just Austrian replacement therapy or providers often see patients who have been to another clinic for details on transferring your care or to become a new patient coal aside\nFor zero five nine for two thirty one hundred that's four zero five nine for two thirty one hundred more visit universal men's clothing dot com\nIt's Monday October have what's new today on the free I her radio radio\nFor decorating the house for just setting the dairy move our pumpkins by the platelets has ... with labor inspired when no after day\nThan blank mixture you break out all our great valium party playlists whether you were at home or the stadium the new I our Radio Free ... collections that come out now\nYou can hear cagey okay online on my heart radio ... by law offices abroad Boston Irish tax problems call rod polston at eight zero one to one for six\nAnd\nI have dealt with some frightening things before but I think that was the most frightening our I've I've ever spent on the radio I I I'm not speechless and I think I was speechless twice in that interview 'em I mean\nJust the quick thing they talked about what a fifty fifty proposition being able to be changed to a Ninety ten proposition just by suggestion by ...

in the program\nI have feelings too [noise] however that last hour really really really well really good [noise]\nYou know this is something that I've been talking about for years I mean since since we you know we're working together just the two of us in the nineties and I said someday it's going to be that you won't believe your eyes because they'll be able to create a video of anybody doing anything and you won't be able to believe your eyes\nWhile we're there\nI've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour\nWhy did that affect you so much\nUm couple of things uh one I think like we all there's a lot of people who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that\nThere's some evidence that they do um you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they making lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true in a lot of cases\nYou know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter would do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really\nA major thing that this is you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks\nThey've taught and all this is like a lot of it as a leader in in in psychology yeah this I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is the real\nDeal with some real credibility comes from the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to se discrepancy Hillary and voter right right um but\nBeyond that uh ... seems incredibly helpless to me to stop it I mean just you know 'cause we talking about this all the time\nHow do we move how do we how do we convince people how do we persuade people to look at the world and a slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right ah and we talked about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily because I just do it right it but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to own my wind myself from Google I honestly have no idea how I Would do that\nAnd I'm and I'm not even use an Android app me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go the Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance\nOnly\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know in one of the reasons they do is it's the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know a search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know it's you get into deep stuff and you but I don't even know how just to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know when you talked about with um certain browsers a use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor the engine search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using and I want to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on chrome so now I've got a strange I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch\nBrowsers I like my whole life has turned upside down and I can't I Can't come up with enough personal cost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like that what did he say\nThree hundred million word\nYet documentary ... like it'd be of of\nData on you and that ... million pages and pages of data and again like but I I don't know\nWhat is the personal cost to me in that data well\nThere's several things there's other things you could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent goes away the Google wants them to go that's in that's incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before\nYou are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you will they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that\nIt is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to the problem is not\nToday this is not today it's just\nTechnology is now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth\nIn ways that we will not be able to understand I mean as the book I write about this in addicted outrage and you know use it you said\nWhen you read the uh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and ... okay well that's a little bleak oh yeah\nBut I mean it fail in their right right it's\nIt's it I mean it ... you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years and he's a he's a Clinton supporter ... is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it backs that up yeah and that's that's what's terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think as a catastrophe pissed right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google risk a road search results are returning things favorable\nTo Hillary Clinton is not some wild crazy theory it's something that already happened in his over where are they now what are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people you saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw how the left really act ... acted crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and as this stuff escalates they're gonna feel justified to take more overt action and you got only knows where that ends up I I I I ... I mean it could go in really bad directions [laughter]\nThis is um uh we we are entering a ten year period now where our lives you really will not recognize your country the world or our lives by twenty thirty\nYou just will not\nIf you when you see the rage on the faces of the leaders of of the left and the Democrats and they're saying we have to get more radical remember you're already talking about a group of people that believe the ends justify the means\nYou're already talking about a group of people and let's make sure we're not like this a group of people that believe they are right to the point that the others have to just be either re educated or eliminated\nLet me ask the Democrats you you have\nFifty percent of the country that just does not honestly seen the world the way you see it\nWe are just as set against what you believe is right if you believe that socialism is the answer capitalism should be shut down and freedom of speech needs to be curtailed\nI Am against that\nHundred percent and I will not comply\nSo what are you going to do with me are you going to silence me at what point do you feel that you have to kill me\nWe live in a world bullets sound and we hope one of the first sound you hear in the morning this morning on your TV ...\nNews you know during mating morning you're not only watching needed for every job listening to I like how you get\nNow from what you need to like write them ...\nAnd you'll get the news and traffic to to start your day off by ...

I guess they could start using\n... I Do like the old uh you know ... take the leadership roles women carpets and then just have horses trample them but that might hurt a horse you know in the left would not want to do that you know I guess you could get a smart car or you know a Chevy Volt\nBut and set on fire and then you'd die screaming or could be a win win there any way um oh my gosh did you just threaten yeah what are we talking about here\nHow do you turn this up pat how do you turn this up without violence\nI think the only ... level up is revolution isn't it that's about the only thing they haven't done so far there screaming and people's faces a they're showing up at restaurants in department stores and everywhere Mexican waters told them to their homes their clawing at the door of the U.S Supreme Court it's\nThey're threatening online yeah they're they're scaring people they're charging them with with crimes they didn't commit I mean I think we're all pretty sure he's not a gamer gang rape is right now I'm pretty sure I don't even ... yeah\nMean you know there were five people five people only one charge was Ford Ford was one the other for ... they weren't real now why do we say well no woman would do that well I Know you've got four people over here who did ...\nMultiple huge stories of fake accusations of sexual assault that have happened over the past few months so this happens all the time because women are people right we're going to people and do what they do bad things just like men do bad things\nBig story ah I think it was in California of a high school kid and I was accused by these high school girls they called them demean girls yeah it was in the same city where\nAre the movie supposedly took place um and so these girls all got together because they didn't like this guy and decided to accused him of sexual assault he went through all kinds of health over it\nAnd uh after six months or a year they finally admitted nano we made that up why\nBecause we didn't like to listen to them and I like to look at him\n... oh ... wow amazing so did you hear the credible stuff did you hear make them scared the ... make them scared ... does he was from the University of Washington\nA and a a it's a website where you can just um you know put your allegation out about how you been raped or whatever you just include that person's name you know where they are what class cetera et cetera and just we're gonna make I'm scared\nWow yeah my university students on the university Washington campus\nUh I mean what what else what else\nI mean this is the world the left is is increasingly embracing mhm legitimizing and calling for and what are the the normal\nCivilized way to escalate a situation when you're not getting what you want right you can do things like you could escalate your language it's hard to escalate past gang rape accusations it's kinda hard to go past that with your language I guess you gotta murdering good of genocide as a couple of other things I guess you could accuse U.S Supreme court justice stopped get your way\nUh then you have a like a they already they already say the United states is a genocidal carry right I mean there's there's no way you can increase the language against America were men so then you can go to structural or procedural type of things but I mean look what they did here they they pulled out every stop they tried to get\nA they'd delayed until late and delayed they try to get an FBI investigation that and they said that wasn't enough and we're seven at the end he said seven FBI back riding with no\nEvidence and all of these zero thousands and thousands of people show up screaming we believe we we believe the survivor well\nSurvivor of why why I mean until it's confined she's not a survivor right like I mean at least to us she may if something happened to her and she's telling the truth like having a yes she's a survivor to herself but as a society we have to judge it based on the facts right\nAnd I own condemn her I don't wish ill torture nothing nothing I don't know I wasn't there no but we don't destroy either life\nThere's got to be some evidence against the guy it's not up to him to prove that he didn't do it no\nIt doesn't know they don't need evidence can we play the audio of this is me I uh [noise]\nThis is me half listening somebody said to me Glen you don't want to do this interview blah blah blah and I heard London I thought I heard the b._b._c. and I was like oh yeah 'cause I thought they would be you know they they would be the detached from it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "08"}
