Facebook but I I I I I Want to spend some time going over it with you [noise]\nYou know the saying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse and it's really not no it's not may you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find that being said is in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up in parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is and uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so he said\nLook [noise] not so long ago\nI spent ... years of service in China and there there was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting times and there is no doubt that this curses followed up\nOn us so it's not a Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this but I've always liked that\nBecause I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a\nIt's just a saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse I personally think it's a blessing\nMy dad taught me what I was really young that no matter what happens to you there is no bad\nNow he taught me this when I was really young but it took it took me hitting rock bottom alcoholism divorce everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned that\nIt took a dark chapter in my life that they taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it\nIs this going to change you in destructive ways is it going to make you angry\nAre you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance blame or will\nYou allow whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you\nThrough\nEnlightenment through correction new understandings humility\nIt's up to you\nSo living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we'll learn the hard way like I actually had to take hit the end and learn through just total collapse\nBut one way or another humility will rain again because we have we have an unbelievable lack of humility in DC in Hollywood of a story today to tell you about Michael ... who's now quitting the music

that if you violate one part of that you're a traitor you're a traitor to the race the party the cause whatever\nThey are wrong and we remain right now there are real true right and wrong but there is there is truth but I don't think any of us are really looking for at least a large section isn't looking for it we are indeed living in interesting times\n\nBut he is ... is our crisis is our problem of them problem because that's what the world is trying to sell us\nI personally think it's an ... problem all of us both sides all\nOf us and maybe we don't see it because we're so busy staging and filtering and enhancing the colors on our Facebook or Instagram pictures that we can really no longer recognize what what is true even about our own lives\nBecause everything that we print in post most of it is ally one way or another subtle or bold its ally and why is that\nBecause we've been marketed to ever since we were born all of us you were born after Nineteen fifty you are marketed to your whole life\nEspecially now it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse you are not complete unless you wear consume you own your vacation at or you don't buy products a or B\nYou're not

politician or party a B or C opinions now our products as well that you must embrace and where somebody else's not yours\n\nAnd now we're in the final stages where we ourselves are products companies like Google and Facebook an Amazon and YouTube but\nWe're not a customer we're now the commodity were the thing they're selling oh you want this group of people that want to buy these things here they are\nThey if you can't fill in the line I Am blank if you can't fill that in with an actual\nWord in be it complete happy satisfied excited or I Am worthless\n\nIf you don't fill it in yourself somebody ... somebody else will\nAnd marketers are trying to fill that in for you you buy this product and you can say I am cool or I Am in style I\nAm rich I Am smart you by Democrat and you can say I am compassionate\nYou by the Democratic label I Am smarter than others I Am science minded and it doesn't even matter if you really are doesn't matter if you've ever given a dime or given any time to anything just by buying this label you are compassionate\nIt's the label that everybody needs now\nIf you want to buy Republican well then you get to be patriotic I unpatriotic I support our troops I support family values it doesn't matter if you're a whore in it every night if you're a guy there Republican label you can say that by the Christian label and you can do whatever you want\nYou just use religion to excuse you or others in their behavior\nBy the label progressive\nOh my gosh I Am science minded even though you deny basic biology\nLabels like courage ideas courage\nThat has a price tag now but don't buy now because the price of courage is going lower and lower for a while for a while this\nThis was a time revered label you actually had to earn this but now it can be yours simply by saying things out loud in a room full of people who all agree with you and we'll cheering clap when you finally say what they're thinking\nThat's courage oh half such carnage\nLabels and words are experiencing a fire sale and it seems everything must go now\n\nBut once that fire sale is over something else happens and what comes next forces people to earn their labels and that's the world we're about to enter\nAnd I actually think it's a blessing not occurs\n\nI'll explain when we come back\nAmerican financing there are benefits to refinancing your mortgage\nRight now you can lower your

between black and white slavery or freedom good or evil life and death the choices are going to be that clear\n\nWe will all know in the years to come who we really are\nIf we choose carefully who we really are otherwise\nWe will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nWe can become through this struggle exactly who we were born to be our best and highest self\n\nIf each of us were honest and we began to see the struggle in the proper like we did Mitt that it's the softness of our foundations that have caused all these troubles it's\nAre wanting an easier life not making hard choices not having to say no not having to say yes\nBut Brock Obama nor Donald Trump or the problem or the solution there symptom look around you no matter who you voted for I think all of

hundred dollars to get your think being your nonsense publish these were top and journals can you can go through how you how you made the decision to go that direction\nYeah actually you know a little over a year ago about a year and a half ago I heard you on on your program reading out from the paper I wrote previously with Peter ... the ... as a social construct\nAnd I ended up going in one of these hey hey\nOr to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low\nUm review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or was it was only fun fun right hum that innocence\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we\nTook the criticisms we got from that to heart ...\nUh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use paid published journals in any sense\nA secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\nA couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there it's the big problem and I hope people\nContinue to address it a secondly we decided that um we would use the highest\nRanks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it\nWould go to the next one and then thirdly we committed to being transparent about her results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh early on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our problem is\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already so he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and it's since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the ...\nIt just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public\nEye took maybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nOn my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell in the other day yeah\nAh so this was an an immense amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work it was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of\nBackground in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers and striking author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I pay ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably\nThe highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published if people are being considered for tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process\nBut typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spans seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know you I Know who you at twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in the end we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and the\nMan credible where they

studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would um just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just say this is this an act says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means faced\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the way in a very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and leftist fit in that without being contracted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because he didn't he wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly papers they claimed for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um does the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class

can change with large developments obviously you know something like a you know oh lord were to break out these were changed completely uh you know individual scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape\nTo control the Senate and a really bad shape to continue their control of the house\nI mean look at the X. dream policies that the left is looking to push in\nThrough the Democratic party free health care\nSingle payer sorry single payer health care free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger\nA infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten\nOr ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than I think uh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it\nFreddy there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYeah we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just signed up to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\nThey know that is a fundamental I'm a of a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first\nPlace the state's said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can a control everything well then ... what do we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you loose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter but I mean those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening so now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right\nI'm only have to do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump's sports that for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gives you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean that you know it'd be which have been wants that like as a Republican I certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nRight is it is to run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmlands trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's why the house and Senate both exist to give balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the hand out right\nAnd it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things could be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way\nSo you go through another body that was much slower but it wasn't just that it was slower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for wrecked trying I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator Brock Obama was center I shouldn't care about\nThat because they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president\nAnd the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas like no that's the opposite this the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed [laughter]\nAre you arguing for king right with these several hours in a row the mic give you the argument for it came\nRight I mean okay really they've failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and slid lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter] uh no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure park right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America and the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane absolutely insane\nAll right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but\nThat's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... last week the Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nUsing\n... can anybody just get up and started directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise]\nI mean especially with a union job would be you'd be in the bottom river [laughter] what what\nWhat laws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law\nThe browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how\nCan you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we do want to make it any worse\nHe's trying to make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream\nOur police can do no right\nA different lens might be a little ... than ah than the new\nYork Times and CNN and all of them really so it can be fun and it's a right before the election and
