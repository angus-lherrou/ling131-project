com\nNews radio one thousand Katie okay am decay X Y and famine Ninety six point one agency\nLet's see [noise]\nThat are just going to ask you what is its Jr actually tried to be careful about when you're doing all this research\nWell there's a difference between a shooter and a a shall we say true collectors peace now now given the price of machine guns these days all of them are are collector's items but\nThere are some of them that are really more shooters\nOkay and for instance I have I have an MP forty that is a\nEight to gun which is a a U.S produced receiver that has a German uh parts kept on it that was produced sometime between Nineteen sixty eight and a Nineteen eighty six now that gun to me is just shooter\nOne is that the one that I shot that is the one that she was shot as long as the younger one of the\nMost delightful guns on any time I have ever shot\n[noise] now the comparison okay because I'm more than one MP forty I have one that came out of the Winchester museum when Winchester went bankrupt this gun is late Nineteen forty three gun that is absolutely all original\nYou as a cause the Germans like their their numbers and they put the last to share the last two digits of their serial number on virtually all the parks and every part on that gun is number two the receive\nMight give me an idea of the price difference between those two\n[noise] uh the two guns have been running in the fourteen thousand range\n[laughter] okay um [noise] I\nJust stopped my insurance on the uh on the show which I collect or the sea and Oregon the curia when relic on\nBecause the last uh Rock Island are of Rock Island auction a collector and the forties went for some really outstanding prices I kind of figure something in the um\nTwenty twenty five thousand range\nOkay so knowing what you're getting could be the six thousand dollar difference or in some of these guns that could be a twenty or thirty thousand dollar difference\nYes gallery to go through with me because people are gaining okay great but you know\nI Know a guy who's got a gun kind of a deal I mean you and you get these calls 'cause you're known as the machine gun guy and you get these calls and you described to me kind of the the three gun example of three different types of guns ... means machine guns just as far as what you can buy a maybe can't\n[noise] well I was recently talking to a police department and this is our explained what they had no Kay um machine guns generally fallen registered machine guns generally fall into three categories\nAnd if you imagine the tops in sub machine gun that was built in Nineteen forty three and there were three identical Thompson ... Cheryl number\nYou know a hundred thousand one hundred thousand two hundred thousand and three okay so so they in essence are identical ... one of them\nWas registered before November thirtieth of Nineteen sixty eight\nGuy one of them was free imported into the country between Nineteen sixty eight in Nineteen eighty six and the last one was re imported into the country after Nineteen eighty [noise] okay okay [noise]\nThe first one is what we would refer to as a transferable machine gun it can be transferred to any body who could ... who could legally buy a pistol\nOkay you have to be Twenty one you have to not be a convicted felon you do have to live in a state that allows you to own a machine gun in there are a number of states you probably could guess them\nThat don't allow you don't own a machine gun fortunately Louisiana swamp it does [noise]\nUm [noise] anyway the transferable guns\nAre are freely transferable that rare but freely transferable they're also there for the most expensive a gun that has been brought in after Nineteen sixty eight but before Nineteen eighty six [noise] is typically either owned by dealer as a dealer sample\nOr by police department now the dealer samples during that time can be freely transferred between dealers okay that can't be transferred to an ordinary a consumer but they can be transferred between dealers the final type of gun\nIs one that was a\nBrought into the country and registered after Nineteen eighty six after May of Nineteen eighty six and those are restricted guns and they are restricted\nOnly to the military police and a dealer who can get a letter from my law enforcement agency requesting a demonstration of that got so\nIn a run through the what would be roughly the prices of these three guns in the market because if you if more people can own it then it becomes more valuable that would be the pre sixty eight right\nThe pretty sixty eight guns you're probably depending on the model in the condition probably looking at twenty thousand dollars or maybe it maybe more depending on what it is I mean if it's a cult Thompson it may be twice that\nUm the uh what we refer to as the pre sample guns the guns that were imported and register between sixty eight in eighty six those run about half of what a transfer of ... so call it ten maybe twelve thousand dollars for\nThe final category are typically only worth the some of their parks a thousand bucks because Thompson parks have have value to them but not really any kind of big money\nSo I think that you talk about three guns three consecutive Sarah numbers could be worse twenty thousand could be worth ten thousand could be the worst one thousand\n[noise] it depends on the paperwork and if if you are possessing the gun with the wrong type of paperwork that could be worth like ten years\nI'm sure it that way 'cause it would be contraband for a person to possess it who does not either\nA habit transferred to them on the proper form okay in the in the case for transferable or for a non dealer\nTo possess either of the dealer sample guts now I Need to throw a caviar out there the person who is a dealer who owns dealer samples that are pre Nineteen eighty six\nIf he gives up his license can keep those dealer samples that's another reason why they're they have good value\nYour guy they hold on to say 'cause I got to take a quick work you're going to come back I Want to continue the conversation talking for a lot of what would be and this is the question what would be a good way to get in to\nSet full auto World War two different

at a Starbucks she she does the guy\nHe's in his late sixties right the police have not identified them which is a good move but there's twenty four year old woman says quote I never would have expected that from him he just seemed like a very Meek guy so I was surprised but also very grateful I was very grateful that he was there\nAnd I was glad it was somebody we see regularly so that

of Michael Bloomberg just announced he is going to register I think he just did register as a Democrat because if we didn't know he was\nOriginally he was a Republican\nAnd then on his last a run for
