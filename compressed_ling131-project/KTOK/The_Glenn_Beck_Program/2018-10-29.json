them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so\nThe world just cited let them have this scrap\nOf land they say was theirs because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as for told\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and style and couldn't concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nAnd a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews but people of all faiths\nAll faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\n\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect we no longer help refugees because they're Jewish we help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that a madman went into Philadelphia to try to stop this is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning\nThe horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people\nAnd yet here we are again the group of people who now have to concentrate just on one thing survive\nAnti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease\nAnti Semitism is as old as the world\nFrom the moment\nGods said I Will make you my people there has been anti Semitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism every time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always the first\nAnd if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's washed in blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\nThe\nWorld makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\n\nWe said never forget I've told you you are the audience that will in the in ... the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence\nThe world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people\nBecause the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east we will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\n\nThe cycle of hate has to be gone again and it's not Donald Trump and it's not for rock Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time and the world always acts the same way\nBecause it always comes in a time of chaos\nIt always comes in a time of fear it always comes in a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society if why\nOur founders came here in the first place it's why our founders defended the Jews\n\n\nWe're a different country we're a different people we're not better than the rest of the world we just see things differently\nAnd if we don't shame on us\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\nOur first gray seal of the United states was the pillar of fire and pharaohs horses and the party of the red sea\n\nI don't want to just survive I don't want to\nDo something to earn a living I watch a live\n\nFDR said this generation\nHas a rendezvous with destiny\nI echo those words\nAnd look how the press just they do they made this into Donald Trump made this ended Donald Trump\nNow that one is at least you can draw a line from the idea that he is not that he was at the rally it was not Trump's Reno fault or anything but I at least he was a Trump supporter\nBut the guy who did the shooting at the at the synagogue they're trying to do the same thing he outwardly hated Trump outwardly hated him\nHe posted on social media about how he was really just assisting the Jews or that he he that people thought he talked to a good game but in reality he was helping Jews and I and we need to stop it he hated the guy they don't try to turn it into\nA giant cartoon safe fell on Donald Trump\nToday and he was removed from the earth mhm do all these problems would still exist this is not Donald Trump Donald Trump is a symptom there\nIs a sickness in our society our political system is nothing more than a reflection of us\nAnd people are alone they're tired they're afraid they don't want to be stuck in the middle between two parties that are blaming each other for everything or blaming them\nYou know why America is a little upset right now they're tired of being blamed they're out here in Boston their ass they're out here working every single day trying to raise their kids trying to figure out how to navigate and keep their children safe while in a prison system called school\nThat is teaching and and doing everything that most parents believe\nThey come home they're tired they don't know how to solve it they're overwhelmed society is just pouring into their house with with the media and social media\n[noise] and then they have to sit and they have to watch people screaming at each other on TV and\nThere's nobody actually answering questions there's nobody actually offering a solution none of these things anybody is talking about is the solution\nIs just blame the other side and most Americans are tired of it because they're the ones getting blamed\nThey're the ones that are racist they're the ones that are massage and ... they're the ones\nExcuse me we're just outta here bussed in our rafts trying to make a living while you freaks\nAre limited high on the hog on our tax dollars [noise]\nI'm Sorry but

Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly but surely\nBut he he's like you know did he he didn't go there to be dealt with today is the first question was ah you know but what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah [noise] this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well ... ... what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter\nA outwardly heated Donald Trump\nYeah we did not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to it yet but you do more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment\nBut it has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they we never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to bring to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the Republican Don Was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault\nNo we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not they didn't even talk about it because they they had a very balanced view of\nThat one re understood that individuals were responsible for their own actions that time is right understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them and and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes we can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the pipe bomb thing saying thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individuals responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not you ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob ... and this morning is because uh you know or he sees doing more on trivia and uh and porridge trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nYeah it's it you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse for a little wire like an hour a week as and just be mean to yeah interest me mean to be [laughter] five dumb they are [laughter] so so\nAnd don't you dare apologize for that\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know and that one I'm never going to bend on that one\nAnd in fact repeated a ... consistently just repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nBoth thank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on Sunday Coming\nNo because we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I'm going to be free tickets but seriously oh now all of sudden you're in your life can change I I ... you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ... that that would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you are what ... Sunday\nOr ... I think it Sunday yes it's going back to accomplish tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's got to be find there's a lot of election stuff to talk about like a a stuff yeah those were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the ... turned\nCompletely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy said it does\nAnd Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am a taking all of the proceeds from the I'm from the event\nAnd um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nThe uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we're going to give them to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um\nTo a a local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the the synagogue and I'm not sure and I sense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I noticed you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember [laughter] and you came back to this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know and then she posted here's an example of that supporting the Jewish\nPeople and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros or as as an example of how much you hate the Jews now I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard\nA that was a bicycle national award one of the highest um in most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just it was\nJust presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nOh well that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed not a big one so it's just amazing\nYou know 'cause this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative and the people in this audience\nI Would leave all would fall into this category many of them will criticized George Soros but they criticize him because he's a liberal progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him around him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history\nOr around the world that but anti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew [laughter] same way they don't\nLike fish Shapiro because you're in front of the hero [laughter] reporting the policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew now but because\nHe came up with the idea of communism I\nI'm not a fan no not a fan\nOf fat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before is that because they're anti Semite it's because they don't like within Shapiro said they will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal\nAnd they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know cannot no night it's not all understand that they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives they're anti\nSemite we you're telling me the way they uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who is one of the biggest financier the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\nOver it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinions because they don't support what they believe it's not about it it is trying to make these into cartoon arguments which is such a a ... ...\nAgain this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nSay it anyway 'cause they don't care [noise]\nThat is that that is exactly what they they they claim to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there to\nGo to a battering I don't know what I have at this point and ah we're we're\nGoing to talk about one when we come back ...\nDeal came to be a little everywhere you want to listen on our ... downloaded now\nSo let me talk to you a little bit about um [noise] buying\nOr selling a home if you are if you're buying a home right now

what you give them no matter what apologies say no matter how sincere it is no matter who they are not asking you to remove up who they're not asking you to change they're asking for something that you can't possibly give them any earlier you realize that the better\n[noise]\nLet me change the subject to enough is enough when America will enough be enough\n\nNew polls Americans fed up crave unity admitted violence\nNow this one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third party\nThey want unity that number is even higher\nBut I'm not sure people actually mean this\nI'm not sure what unity even means they say that we no longer really um agree on the core values of our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values\nBut what are those core values\nAnybody know what\nAre the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now\nWay things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied\nThirteen percent are like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen\nPercent Fifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is\nWhat are those values sincerely what are we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's what the surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\nWith an exception of a couple of those aren't values those are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage we have a few things we have to decide we have to decide one so western world war it's saving\nIs freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes or no and I don't want you just uh you know jump off and yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are we sincerely which are we we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice is in it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one no no you don't\n\nIt's not a binary choice the answers were both\nWe're both we've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America\nAnd not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\n\nWhy is the constitution were fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on\n\nI I'm I we cannot sit here\nAnd argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic\nEssential values in line like climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth okay that's a value\nThat's not climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem is there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nBe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion in ... in the scientific field\nYou gave me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work\nNow that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you know where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled is shut up that's a violation of our values\nWendy will sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is ... this is collusion and\nThat your your system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system and it doesn't\nWork\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nAre the values\nWe both care about the earth who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth and I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it don't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is not about litter\nYou either care about it or you don't words don't mean anything anymore only actions do\nDon't tell me what you believe show me what you believe\nAre mounting a murderer is now on the ... are

different\nPeople are now saying that you know the problem is is that Americans don't agree on basic values and principles anymore well I agree\nWith that but nobody even is talking about those when's

X. Y. fmri Ninety six point one agency\nYet another suspicious package I'm Dave Anthony Fox News intercepted this morning in Atlanta address to CNN this is the man accused\nForce them to go early to get all the activists out then they could have them go and you know go pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're I mean there there are ... are doing on that particular day but there's one interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then change to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that is people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if it's Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney in two thousand twelve\nAnd then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand sixteen so two thousand twelve on average squirting five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nIn two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nAre we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states\nSo if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate into two dozen sixteen\nBut a big big move from two thousand twelve got it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correct team now they were Twenty one district that voted for Barack Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr so in two thousand twelve with rock Obama they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama\nOr in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs it you would think of these real swing districts so far polling you're showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points but big the big change to it and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting roam around ...\nSo if you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Obama\nWith Romney or the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for over ... been changed to Trump in the Obama election that had a five point advantage for Obama and those states in the Trump election there is about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats show now that part of that it's it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWe're this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania's like an example of that where they have a just a big lead or not because\nI don't think that's necessarily solely because of some switch like just have a ... tell me what all this\nMeans from last week or the Democrats making is is the momentum start just lose starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers are showing that I mean it right now seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid in the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all of due to the shooting in the bombing\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably in your real polling reaction that at least till today we have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday the early okay we'll look forward\nThat election by numbers on the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nThis weekend as you know a gunman opened fire at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh he shot and killed eleven people during Sabbath services injured six others for where police officers\nThe guy was insane\nHe hated Donald Trump that doesn't make him a Democrat\nDoesn't mean that he was you know following\nI dunno Cory Booker whoever it just means there's just not political\nAnd should it be we keep jumping to politics first I Can't imagine what these families are going through\n\nPennsylvania has taught us before with the Amish how to deal with killers\n\n[noise] if you've been listening to me um for a long time you know what I Believe is coming and have said is coming for a while and I'm always wrong with timing\nBut I don't think there's any way to deny that what I've worn was coming is here now we're seeing the beginnings of it now\n\nAnd it's only going to get worse and it's going to get harder it's going to get harder for you to stand up\nHave they taken gab down yet I think the\n... the service provider for them has taken them down um I don't know if they're back up as not gaps fault gap is that it's kind of a\nShorter competitor I guess I Would say that they found up are becoming a\nSafe haven for anti Semite so I guess and and and you know\nI don't want that nobody wants that but we we either believe in freedom or we don't and yes I don't I don't like the poison that they put out\n\nBut I also don't like the silencing of voices this America man this is American principles you can't silent voices\n\nSky was deeply disturbed really bad guy\n\nYou know you watch TV and you see the victims the faces curling across the TV screens\n\nAnd you might think that things are getting worse\n\nAnd I guess historically speaking this is the worst anti Semitic shooting we've ever had in the history of our country eleven people\n\nOn the positive side that's nothing compared to some countries\n\nI saw some reporters say you know the problem is is a this is Donald Trump I Hope you I Hope you're happy that do you have

you haven't been out of the road for a while I think it's going to be so good for you because you need to connect with the people yes I agree\nMy friend and I generally a I had a a friend of mine that's a Vietnam veteran in his seventies and we went all the way we live in Ashland, Kentucky we got up at two AM stroke six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday\nAnd and then stood for eleven hours straight because we were told the first two thousand people in line would get into the hangar\nAnd we knew we were going to get that way and and as it got their security and looking at George saying oh I Can't wait to sit down and you get to the hanger and there were no states so there's the reality of we're going to be standing another six hours\nOn concrete so what we're saying is this president is a lawyer [laughter] I'm Sorry I just play that just playing the Brazilian go ahead tell us or\nI could say it as much as they want you know what we were standing in line making fun of the Carbondale a solidarity network which was a socialist group that was coming to protest they had to have their eleven AM pancake\nBreakfast before they came to protest and you know we we were joking well do you think there were a vegan include free option is to go along with that and right but\nThere were ten thousand people there for the rally unless they Seventy five people showed up to protest\nThere was not a piece of how would you say this about your ... function is when you've had the restoring functions\nThere was no garbage we he would never know when I was ten thousand people there you know one was complaining yeah I was a kind of had to warm up to Trump myself and I tend to get to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down\nNo people were so open about talking and\nYou know someone had to go to the bathroom ... their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child well well you you run and do an air to come back real quick it was it was such a positive environment and\nYou know it's like a president that's happened to show it was I and I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois because I remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break\nThe shooting mhm and\nWait we also went through the doubt whether the president was going to show up or not and this was after we got in the hangar Lincoln standing there for two hours but we never gave up hope and we were we we all ... we had jokes or you know conservatives the one thing liberals can do better than us as chance we
