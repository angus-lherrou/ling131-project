just not difficult\nWhy would you well you probably heard me say for a long time I have a real fan of the scopes that are in the low magnification range wonder if I have two to six that level\nWhy is that well depending on where you are and if you're an area where you're like walking through the woods keep up the lowest power\nThat way if a deer jumps up right in front of you could throw that

Tom talk guy metal starting to get you into your folks in doing that right now and we're pretty much open lines of or something you want to talk about if it has to do with guns or gun safety\nWe can certainly do that by the way I just heard a report have not been able to find a report on line but somebody who should know or some folks at a uh an auction house we're having firearms getting ready for\nAn auction and somebody ... accidentally negligent like negative gently however you wanna put it fired around kill somebody and the auction house\nEvery gun is always ... always loaded first grew right treat every gun so it's loaded what does that mean do pointed it at any one and that includes anyone\nWho's on the other side of a wall if there's a wall there and there are people in the other side of it remember boats go the walls\nThere may be no one in the room where you are\nBut there are people on the underside don't point them you're going to ... you got to be able to use your imagination what if what if what if what if it goes off here what if it goes out there where we point it\nIn a moment you pick up a gun you open the action the instant the microsecond you pick up a gun you open the action and look don't just open it look you see around and there are there around the magazine and the [noise]\nIs there around in the chamber look if you can't look good flashlights look in the action looking the barrel stick your finger in their feel\n\nNot only can happen it does happen if someone had you had gone to look at and they say it it's okay it's unloaded\nCool not alone and do you look at\nAnd even when it's loaded it still loaded as far as how you handle it\nFair enough okay [noise] uh\nLet's see blind to John's with us Clovis, California I Am glad to get this call hey John welcome to talk\nWasn't looking like big and [noise]\nWell I Am really glad somebody remember scenes versus us Nineteen sixty eight\nI've been using that did it meet the anti gun cult is for well over Twenty years and it drives him nuts\nWhen you bring it up they stop in their tracks like that can't be right right now I Know when I was\nLate what we're talking about because there are a lot of people don't know what we're talking about we're getting kind of deep in the weeds but this is a very effective tool to have a new tool box when you're talking about guns and gun control and gun registration with somebody go for it\nAll right the it's the Supreme Court case Nineteen sixty eight have H. A. Y. N. E. S. versus United States\nIt's actually ha I guess I'm starting to ... and you're right I see why you're right I'm Sorry I Apologize\nAnd go ... some nail is is you cannot hold criminals legally responsible in other words you can't prosecute them for noncompliance with any little gun control law you come up with because that violates their Fifth Amendment right against self recrimination\nSpecifically you cannot require a criminal to register his gun because their registration of it would be admitting that he's not not allowed to own it\nSo that would be self in combination in this case in this Nineteen sixty eight case it with somebody with a you know say a a prohibited something you'd have to register under the national firearms act got prosecuted and the court says will actually if you if he were to register it\nThen that would expose him as a criminal and that self incriminate nation and we have a law that says you can't require somebody to incriminate himself so no\nRegistry gun registration laws do not apply to criminals and we sell to people that it's like their heads explode\nYeah that's also why you hear about a used the stereotype Chicago gets busted with an A. K. and they say in Chicago you can't have that but what are they charging with felon in possession they don't say oh you violated the anti gun laws no no no no you're a felon with possession\nBecause the cop and the da's office no we try to do it for this\nAll his lawyer that's what they have them there goes that\nYeah it it is an interesting thing when people are saying well you know we need to register guns in there were so are you do understand that you cannot require felons people who are prohibited from owning a gun to register their guns as your work\nSo they're really the only people you want to require to register guns are law abiding people that tend to stop and they go well no that's not right and they were just telling you hang versus us Nineteen sixty eight\nIt says it itself from criminal nation to require someone who can own a gun to register a gun\nAnd so you can't require that so the bottom line on it is that gun registration laws apply only to the law abiding and then their heads go just spinning around like Linda Blair and The Exorcist", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "28"}
