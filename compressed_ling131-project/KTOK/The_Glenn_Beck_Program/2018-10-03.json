and I'm doing well how are you\nGood I'm I'm a I'm I'm really fascinated by how we make the turns in our society for the future and a ownership is a big part of this because in the future I don't know how many people even own cars I mean it's just it's just all changing\nBut do we really own things when we buy them on line\nSo I think there is a real concern here that consumers go into transactions when they're buying things and digital goods especially digital books movies music\nThey go into this transaction assume when they were the same way they do in the in the world of tangible goods where if you buy a book\nYou can give it away to a friend you can lend it to someone you can leave it in your will or in the future and you know a leave your book collection or to or your loved ones\nAnd the rules that control these digital transactions when you buy something on your Kindle or my shows are very different from the rules that we expect in the physical world\nAnd consumers don't really understand that distinction and I think that causes a real disconnect between what we all expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a quick example I'm just [noise] um\nA couple of weeks ago I'm a consumer uh a customer of the apple ige and he's a movie store found that three movies purchase had that we had been deleted from his account they were no longer accessible and I think

to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship is you've just described it it's also real concerns\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers and only the hands of you know the\nThe the two or three companies um\nThat dominate these markets then there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved um the these works\nIn an air and it with the movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know that the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered directors ... edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise] um\nOh my gosh so they almost a force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and uh you know fully restored but you still had the old copy now that's right you can't ... I mean even ... I mean think of this even just for comparison\nYou can if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they were originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that once you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem in this most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally when these services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm for with the Apple TV for example\nThe Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access it through their ... servers\nExactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded of something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nOr so\nIs it allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nCars that Kendall is tattered through soft where right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it move those files strong\nHubble can you talk about all go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forest everybody to have it exactly [laughter]\nBizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making provide tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them you it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change their cars that isn't it\nA real change I don't think people considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and they will come back and get you to answer that question a and just the change in\nCapitalism change what does

into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line that's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform and\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah and I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine\nGoogle actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning they blacklisted the entire Internet that shows you the ... the scope and the size that Google ... wait a minute how it's it's a ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW\nYes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using a Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but is your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is\nGolf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states\nUse Google we we we highlight in the film for example Robert ... signed this scholar who's been critical of Google\nA Clinton supporter a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech if you have on gender or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission so\nHere's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know\nGoogle is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however they are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their\nA I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nThere's that this is just at the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing how many people that you just look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the
