program you know\nWhat I'm saying and a ... or he is um he's a guy that we had books last hour and a guy\nKind of went in a different direction but I did it fits right in to what we have been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we're going to fight back and\nWe should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the true and steady we have to speak truth\nDo not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but\nWe were not at a place where I think he grabbed a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads steps are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage of a nice time to talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime at a younger age and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response or the way a lot of people\nFeel like I Know you are a lot of built up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around\nThe world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture the whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged\nAnd they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a wry reality like ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not every day we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation has faced challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats we observe new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nOutrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path that I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed I think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage\nIs to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said you fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly the not participate\nYeah that's okay I I I'm On my desk actually right after the front of me a name played because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news\nI Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but I'll lying the false prophet\nAnd so it's actually one of my staff made into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way is interrupted does either Baptist church but but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed one of the members of the family as well a Christian Today so somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what\nWe can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us in the book is filled with examples of Christians who actually built relationships with people who radically disagreed\nAnd in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is a president by all university which is a Christian university in California are met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party the state legislature there in California\nThat was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more well ended up getting to understand each other better\nThe will the bill was ultimately not moved forward but dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying\nThat Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well liked a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because at the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media\nI I click on a lake and I find go to the bio and its first think listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained or as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said we understand we forgive you for that\nWe're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating upper called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate goes you know Victor is right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated\nGalleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their about by\nThe name of the book is the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage pick it up meat is well worth the read\nGlenn Beck worldwide and Katie okay dot com\nAre you feeling
