two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent Republican\nA percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans\nFifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats it started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are at Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nFor relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is\nThey will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place and whenever the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans move the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that\nThe Republicans when the house\nThat's the way they're these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to have imposed a nightmare it's a\nNightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive while we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of [noise] oh yeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying ah has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that is one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance that this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all taught supper and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real ... going to\nCome to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest then partisans because partisans engage more like generally um the ... of course a blanket role but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she got an a or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with them and they don't they don't like either side and then they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left\nHas gone insane right and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party\nOr will I ever being right ... that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this data here Glenn if we could get 'em as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about that are interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while it was higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that with a wave election for Democrats [noise]\nI mean unbelievable to people in the west but it happened and I have no doubt that the prince was behind it\nOkay that has no bearing on who he was\nWe can say that this was a despicable horrible crime done by the Saudis and their horrible people for X Y Z and we can say ... did not deserve to die this way nobody deserves to die that that way however\nShe's not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be\nHe's not some freedom loving guy he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs the Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic state he wants an Islamic state in his own writings in the Washington Post\nSays yeah we have to have a an Islamic assist rule\nIf you dismiss as Islam assist rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east well wait a minute I'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule sharia law tell me where it's working out show to me\nWhere is that working out where is it protecting human rights\nNo thank you\nI mean Islamic rule just by another group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia\nNo thank you so I'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy there was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it\nAnd we have found that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving friends because that's not true\nListening to gain the okay twenty four seven with the IRA radiolab download it now like Katie okay dot com and um\nThis report is Roger you buy true car from a city bus usa total traffic studio some of the earlier accidents have cleared sort of north ...

real estate was designed to be a bridge between you and\nA better mouse trap or ... or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are\nThey're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about\nPolitics but at what\nPoint do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did a to Nancy Pelosi in California than hundred centigrade aware does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao in Kentucky exactly latter day\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have persuasion as any goal\nThe the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch heads to a pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of a phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of ... restored downtown and Omaha right now and ah there's no end to fire here\nAnd yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans in a given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that men are basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was shared content\n... there was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think\nPart of what healthy Americans should do is ignore them [noise]\nSo what is our our we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nYes ... or ... soon them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion\nFreedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity\nThat way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a\nPeople are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have\nA couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep

who he is but he's the rebellion guy so he becomes a symbol of her by on the left I mean don't get me wrong are the people on the left or exactly who these people are of course there are but that's often the leadership I'm Talking to an average everyday person who votes they just know\nWhat's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness All right so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are there many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal hang on weight before I'm sure some stuff started with me I should go into education absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because ... testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding the funding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and to feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go well you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in the school prior to Nineteen eighty and was I proudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about the really do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read\nWrite survive in the world without at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked at the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse and they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized control and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready to testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not the end of the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows what writing granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that's easy to counties I crossed all if you\nGet the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve many K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids\nIs Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade it's removed because they're not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible and I got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say and wonder why he has no work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what can I change the ... the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get high school diploma number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally and the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success\nNot even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator as life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr ... tease him I talked to ...\nI'm a doctor who then it goes back to the games are not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory down okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to the degree why should they be bored in school and they should make one school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to be a trade school\nChoice to become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately\nThe average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in the U.S is doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that will get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I work at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation I deserve to go work learn what it means to have a boss lieutenant means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelve right I'll pay for the last two years to have to pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is ... you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHis ... his wife prompts going to happen a\nBunch of cool prep schools will pop up a\nBunch of great trade schools will pop up guess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars he going to say well I don't know that pop up because it's guaranteed government money banks love most guaranteed government money yet they do so they will actually give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere is the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars\nWe saved all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at at at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ethnic or the unhappy kids now think about this a lemon twelfth grade year and a love that's what greater you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nUnder um making sure people show of social media we have a a team on Twitter or team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything's YouTube we do video production\nWe didn't go to and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions\nOf tens of millions of dollars absolutely we've raised almost half a million but to be to be clear if in these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is\nName recognition is my only issue the last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen\nPercent so you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen or ... percent\nThis a five way race thirty percent when this thing so I'm nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent there is the hard part right the math equation can I get to a hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out to enough people\nTo where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over thirty per se I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yes what I hear ya yeah it's really is as well get get remember at as third party in general the system is that against you\nAnd some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this because every day I'm up against failure\nBut the marine corps taught me take the hill the cap and shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do I take the hill as a matter\nI get I I literally deal with failure every day this woman everyday and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even do thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him ... his name he there's decided nope lottery shop dozens of beyond their he decided that the establishment as all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably um maybe tweet\nStorm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think the ... so this is a radio debate yeah well there's going to televise also now okay we both televised on radio ... okay so yeah again and they're just deciding no\nWe don't want them they'll me wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the same party they should all be there\nBut this is the norm and we put up against this whip against is constantly and here's the worst part\nWith all of this we're still growing and they're still going down that's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate hopefully doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the mass among mass forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what sometimes I I Want to get by forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand it's all you can get a okay\nLarry sharp a dot com that's with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and\nAnd how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how do you solve healthcare will do that coming up in a just a second a standby\nOn TV Tonight is tonight Michael reckon ...\nTonight Michael ... from uh New York university a fascinating guy if you haven't met him yet\nYou will tonight and it will be or something you don't forget a guy who used to write white papers for the Communist Party who now says wait a minute and democratic socialist near the hell out of me\nOne thousand trade deal getting\n[noise] busy for Lincoln and our enough bringing you

on video games [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nFind that come in with Larry sharp I'm doing a story will candidate a for a for New York or she\nIs libertarian and uh is making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his his policies are different than the Republican and the Democrat and I believe they're very very workable in a\nIn an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system ah you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond\nMe but I'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um\nYou are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to deep platform or people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for a governor to impede business\nPeriod no ... no ... if I don't like an industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief\nNot not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's he's\nNot only doing that he's also threatening another group of businesspeople that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these yes absolutely\nAnd and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around it eat X right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example\nJust wants insurance forest firearm now we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more\nWell how do they mean insurance now when when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nFor any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue right and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in the state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passing twenty Thirteen and the the fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent felon it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nMatch okay this is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the cops worth ... revamped it all because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire when you're a felon again\nBecause you know one activity cop this is this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing\nIt is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy mhm constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman if I lost\nA hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he's just hadn't thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nWhen it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they have pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we ... we had literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions do sure pensions are there is a ticking time bomb\nYes there's no way to pay for it yeah the you've you're going to break all of the promises jak people who work their whole life and were promised ally yup what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas with your belief for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening and we have all the time", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "22"}
