right steps of the cutting of it a little pieces and put them in individual cases and I think that's your clean up after yourself that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards and it's interesting\nToo that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter I ...\nI think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist was an a or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness what's going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean ... that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven it was a feeling he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one the biggest a political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty you'd rather go all out of it and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and it was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation um when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about four they been our allies since Nineteen thirty three I think\nUh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way that Brock Obama would have done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point in there and it wouldn't have done anything about this a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage today\nThe difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is as Pence of right and they were never good I'm bringing in Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remember this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as this bad guy who who was who's incompetent\nBrock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years a sense of what what are they are living there was a decision made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise the decision\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking their mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally\n... Obama was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something\nIt's just the you know the the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems\nTo see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport in and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still alive the age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nAre actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them because they just paid us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that is kinda I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term I'm\nBy a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority your top priority is not a Judy ... murders in Turkey\nRight like ... you know I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the north Korea anymore so studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing it over and you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up a working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative and there's a lot at stake\nHere a lot at stake I mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they're going to retaliate and if it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nUsing it very strange it is very strange uh and like some of it I I guess I understand like for example are here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco right mhm and if you're over there they call it ...\n... I've never heard that I Will say here's another one here we say Mazda for the car ... if you listen uh as as a as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio they seem as though it's\nMad stuff Toronto that's really irritating I wouldn't get us into that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off at the ... yeah they'll call us mad that we're not stuff that\nWe are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called ... where you are all the commercial\nOn the jaguar what it's like they like if you come up with a name on your\nOwn maybe you can describe

that's incredibly dangerous and our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by a some Hollywood actresses\nThat there is some danger there Karen nightly is\nPromoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by ...\nThe by the way the nutcracker the former realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter eighty from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her and she says don't rescue yourself obviously and this is the one I'm\nBut she ... she's mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not ... as a self\nYes she didn't pull herself out of that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man or a man\nYeah thank you ... there's a lot of women are doing that today the main message modeled on a ... of really the entire movie a is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy\nThat's the message you should be taking from those movies I'm Christian bell is also fearful that Disney Princess is are

delta that ah when she read when she read Snow White del taco bell yes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I looked at my girls and ask\nDo you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no and I'm like\nOkay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it a while you nailed that when they did this and then she'll also say and girls don't you think it's weird

advocating for the Gilman can continue right the kids what gangster out of it right and bell says or because you can't get someone if they're sleeping on the how does that mean in my circumstance [noise] that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book\nRight the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's a magical apple\nThere's a a prince or with a magical spell right on the princess yeah and she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise that yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that pressure lessons don't apply to [laughter]\nSo silly so weird I even get yourself still worked up about the you know what I Hope happens

Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice right from office ... are just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no ... and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't care he occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest hate Brett Kavanaugh\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations\nIt was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court and they couldn't they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and\nCertainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um but\nThe other people in Cory Booker do not care for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him to call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty Canada\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and yeah and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nThen again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up\nTotally different ... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after I think of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh thing was an ... that story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was she can remember how she got there she went dead have back what an avid mountain of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one\nThe witnesses she named instead came out and yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know marry a distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person saying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident but just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one to the hardcore right wing publication of late\nTalking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this uh Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he ... she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people say ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred wow so not while for one person who is at the hotel or at the party in the capital case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nUh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband that her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days but the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's still Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the president over there are so work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred\nThere was a prison outside the hotel window\nWow that is a thousand times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored\nFor ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats\nAnd now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again\nTo them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes on is still makes a big levels speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there\nIt's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact\nThat they that the media actually thinks we should take their current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been\nYou should be taken seriously when your report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened\nI mean that is what that is the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it\nIs now or standard that can sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is substantial evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated or exception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy their so pissed off about that and they don't want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are they are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad they'd even Trevor Noah who's the ...

things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes that are part of this saga with him in ... right after he asked him if he could\nYeah and that and they said yes at odd part of this saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations\nOf him doing something\nThat against them as well right like he would ask they say yes or or um\nOne case where um he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while on the phone with her because I guess he was breathing heavy or something\nAnd ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics our dynamic absolutely yeah the power to make it makes you do all sorts of gay\nBecause as a comedian he's increase wields incredible power right in this country now incredibly led to ever fired at any job in the nation and giving any job and you're\nA sarcasm is just reality and the situation that they're kind of like well why is that what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there or something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was\nWas this was his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the sense of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force her to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation he asked her to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I have issues I'm Sorry\nSay that is is that sexual assault why the accusation there I Know that show was shown what she answered a ... and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievable there's you know so ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right man he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nUh making people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think\nThat the what I just described you is obviously wrong like eight so I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other ... other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nOf that he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the folks who scares away from right you're not supposed to just a Seattle and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this

I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believed uh you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially in everything that they are saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they are accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court brand like no right now is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... ... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over the line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accused me of of the ... of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I think I don't think it happened\nYeah I don't either at the White House and I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe but even that is is this is a\nI don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official or in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades\nThen talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWhat are we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt uh a dislike for the\nParty of the person or that they're accusing there it is a person who has been an activist is march the women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in that motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's got some bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing what about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you do I leave the survivors\nNo no we don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor that indicate that this is this the vets occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would I ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I Would they Levi ... survived\nThis assault by this man\nThey've assault didn't happened they didn't survive and [laughter] yeah I guess we can all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's\nHappened to us so far life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible or a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nWhether they should like this I don't know when I tell her to go we\nTalk about uh yeah I Know we're talking about the\nThe women's right to choose it is just ended as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they ... they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week were five five accusers\nAccused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why\nPeople are horrible many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time\nAnd the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot one of the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they do we know for a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them\nWe know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother to write any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two\nAnd in the second one is the is that there's ... there right when they the person who made the allegation\nSaid I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen and she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly\nThe act I don't even know corroborating evidence on that one either and there's and look the Fort one was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people if there was no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people a cabin on his uh his or what this is worth saying no um\nBut that one was serious because\nShe went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing relatively credible job it recounting what she believed the story was\nWho knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said they were they vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like in the media access if it's entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nI Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you brought up the high school situation in California where they call it the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault or and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk\nI don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him they didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student who uh got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her\nElegy peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a ... you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head
