talk to you I'm ... I I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're seeing with regard to the turnout is a national records are not just for mid term elections which is what the stairs a but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nThe amount of votes that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote with another was called but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure people were subject to stop it uh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is if you care about the future of Texas it would be clear about the future of America or you could not\nSit on the sidelines this election here because there are other people out there\nWho are casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this me to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a lot of times people have said this is the most important election of your life and I was thinking about\nThis last night I I've always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it not\nWell he captured the U.S it was very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either ran under do label or they would call themselves a\nConservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as socialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor\nIn Florida a isn't out now that he says as a socialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the left in the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as\nThe open quarter policies that is socialism or with a look at the uh wealth distribution policy that is socialism handle these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where they reported inflation rate in Venezuela is over a million percent and so it's\nIt's crazy to what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknown to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing and so many of your listeners need to understand this is George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a ... million dollars a directly to a candidate in Harris County down in Houston\nBut this year we have a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that has\nFunded these ground games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for Canada's like Beto but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio Austin you have to El Paso and so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people uh who are Republican to be able to\nGreg always go to

the streets even\nA college Joe Thompson not likely my big brother helped me out he taught me I could do anything\nAt a time when a lot of people were saying just the opposite\nOr the races now down to about six points in the latest poll whether that holds or not it's hard to tell us forty seven forty one and the latest poll um [noise]\nI don't know I mean I think you know I I feel like\nA conservatives and Republicans get teased by Minnesota a lot and you think oh well maybe this time is going to be the time and all the time that never has\nA but we saw that in the presidential election too I mean we how many times the Pennsylvania seem like it was odd to me that's going to happen and they never did until this last election where did turn over a I think the more interesting race those the ones for attorney general in Minnesota we know this one because Keith Ellison is running\nAnd normally I don't think we talk about a specific attorney general race it's not necessarily national interest is one with details that I think is Alison was up by five points in the last full however that Paul happened right before all these sort of accusation started flowing against\nKey selling not true though is it him in the bathroom with the guy is that true [laughter]\nI don't know what allegation that is I don't there was a new allegation the guy I don't want to repeat it I Believe you're thinking of Cory Booker there was an all of them in our area that yes yes you limit her for that one or not true is it I mean I don't ... as I think you should always hosts these things you are innocent until proven yet at the same in charge against Cory Booker right one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every month up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man made an editor ... when we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know\nThat's the way I think you're supposed to hey let's why innocent until proven guilty is a famous\nUh and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism about\nChinese relationships break up and there's things said and who knows\nThere's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believes Cavanaugh I should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with the they don't care about it he thousand can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations\n... it was fascinating if the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda\nWow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time\nAnd he's she's credible she's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy\nDated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses there's Dr reports\nAt the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't right if I wanted to win for I mean it's just crazy yeah it's an amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody\nCertainly the Democrats when they thought they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead is forty three thirty six so right now we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go uh there's a if you're looking at right now a forty a four feet are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have let's see it's forty six excuse me forty six if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are black burn and then in Texas still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer but then you get a few about a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got a another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be at fifty three seats\nAnd expand their advantage if they can if they can pull off six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things passed or so\nYou know at that level of whether it's a I mean they could lose it to they could easily still lose it possible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that it's a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nElection by numbers\nOn the program over twenty third best is

Donald Trump you know the wishes or\nI did not know that you haven't been keeping track of all the ... the the which is that are putting taxes on Donald Trump and\nAnd Ted Cruz and others are and what are they what are the Texas board of the ... actually intended to accomplish destroy them to destroy them yeah I've not seen this no oh okay well I've I've kind of brushed off myself I'm In I'm up on it but I kind of brushed it off I'm like I which is\nNo there is something else that we now have from a credible source that I think every American especially women need to be aware of what's coming up in just a second\nYou happen to see [noise]\nUh\nUh\nIMF financial warnings and the escalation in the central bank gold buying in Hungary\nIs making the news ...\nHungary has increased its gold reserves by one thousand percent in a due to increasing quote safety concerns this is the first time since Nineteen eighty six that\nHungary's central bank is buying gold bullion and it's\nA lot of it up thirty one point five tons of gold ah\nThey also have repatriated their gold from the bank of England to Budapest central banks in Europe are diversifying are moving in and repatriating to take possession of the gold in their own country\n... maybe talking about that for a while really ... who knows that\nAre hungry in Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the Germans\nWere the first to do it uh they had been repatriating their gold from the bank of England and the Federal Reserve in recent months and years just bought it from gold but what about a lot easier right why us for it back when it doesn't really exist [noise] the\nReason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word\nAnd write this down on now\nIn order to do the very high path occasion thing again are you I'm just saying that brought it up when\nYou hear it your blood will run cold when you hear people actually talking about well the problem is ... that's\nWhen you had to the mountains [laughter] that's when you know so\nThat's the only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss ... that's when you run for the hills okay right now we're at the beginning of that possible wonderful thing by um you know everybody claiming their gold\nAnd who's gold really is it all and all of the central banks buying more gold she what is it they know that perhaps you don't know\nMay I suggest you call gold line and I'm not asking you buy and he goes I just want you to read just their report that is out now on what a democratic victory may mean to the United states and to your financial status\nRead it read the report I've read it I recommend you share it with everyone you know\nGet the gold mines special mid term election report right now by calling gold line it one eight six six gold line\nWhich is strange because why he's trapped when there was an opening right there in the you know in the in the lantern there's an opening right\nThere right at and I I think I Would make the same point whiz\nThe cloth device first of all cloth does not seem difficult to penetrate but secondly there is an opening for the eyes I mean the the genie could just go ahead go right through there to get into the head of the person right now they don't I mean just from a pragmatic now they do perspective you just go right through there so long as you're wearing\nGloves a full body you know are covering and then your head is wrapped and you're just have the eyes\nNow your ice can be used to a a lure a man or even just if the eyes if you look at him and just write\nYou can say you know it's not like you know look how they're dressed it's look how they were looking at me around her and so you can uh you know you can be be which if you will by ... by a woman's eyes\nI think even in this in lightened me to era we can all come together and say if a woman looks at you\nYou know what are you going to do right exactly I mean you know exactly right [laughter] especially if she's been possessed by a gym [laughter] I mean you know this is the thing we were talking about this off the air a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday when we're talking about nationalism\nAnd what the definition of nationalism in its history is is at times very disturbing brain um however what you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we're trying to go if you're Donald Trump you're not saying oh we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look we're the best country and we were routed and we have a great the best you know culture and went and we should be\nA you know patriotic and and and be ... up you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you\nWhen you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways you know like I kind of saying that because\nYou've probably been possessed by Jim ...\nThis is the gym targeted and now it's a different kind of Jane threat was found I've had a lot of of didn't talk they are in my life I got to say it's trouble yeah it is and it gets you into believing in the bottle adds up ...\nSixty shots of beer on a program that Lee alive on the air right it'd be an issue but I think I'm OK thing that a culture that embraces women as equals he's superior to a culture that that puts them we won't let them drive and and forces them to address the specific way that you can't even see their face like that it that\nI mean they ... those are all just social construct\nIt may be voted off is a good social ... sometimes things are built in their good to know the good piece of can you know you're not you're not from the west not from the west which brings me back to the caravan when we come back ...\nNews

[laughter]\nSo let's talk about the caravan for a second because we really need to decide what we think about this and what we're going to do about it\nWhat do you think we should do about it and you need to have this conversation with all of your friends right now\nWhat do you call people Seventy five hundred who are political Marxist activists that's what they are political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them is they're marching towards our border\nThey're not refugees they chose to leave their country they're finding their country\nThey were trying to get a do a political stunt\nSo what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathroom services all along the way who's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can't\nMarch twenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat who's providing medical aid who's providing the water who's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else\nWe aired them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact Sarah I don't know if we have this\nVideo but if we could play this a video or if you have it the the video of a these migrants being loaded up into giant semi trucks they're being\nTrucked from place to place from photo opportunity to photo opportunity\nYou pointed this out there that that I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd it's like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk down right like that's not how that happens in them or they're getting out there grouping up there for a couple of miles cameras get them then they get back in trucks and get and they ... they drive look at the\n... video getting role at video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of the semi truck\n[noise]\nCount them even just count them as of right now as to how the uh well you know all of them counted right when all of them ... one one and he said and by the way just to clarify you want you want me to individually point out the women that are women that are quite a big crowd but the women that you can see that the ...\nAnd there was an a on the um\n[noise] one Mm okay now so this isn't women and children who are these people are we\nKnow that MSN MS Thirteen that now has embedded the people in to this group I mean now Seventy five hundred people\nAnd I want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one uh\n\nYeah I think it's a I think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you're putting military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that sent who wins and but I don't think they're going to wind up in the country a wreck and can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you would have a must happen\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be hearing you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in wanting passwords for America can\nYes ... you're you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in and entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treat it as an invasion turn way\nYou see this is an invading force these people they're not going to be legally [noise]\nNow the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nFor keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf or tennis\nYou can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start\nNow only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more [noise]\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to\nGo to relieve factor dot com and now look\nBack at this week in history this week in Nineteen ... sixty three year old schoolteacher named any medicines Taylor becomes the first person to take the plunge over Niagara Falls in a barrel with the help um to assistance Taylor strapped herself into a leather harness inside an old would've handled narrow five feet high and three feet in diameter\nKnock violently from side to side by the Rapids and then propelled over the edge of horseshoe falls Taylor reached the short lived around twenty minutes after her journey began\nAfter a brief flurry of photo ops who speaking engagements Taylor's sane\nCooled and she was unable to make the\nFortune for which she had hoped this week in Nineteen thirty one eight months ahead of schedule or governor Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the George Washington bridge over the Hudson River four thousand seven hundred and sixty foot long suspension bridge the longest in the world that the time connected Fort Lee New Jersey with Washington Heights in New York City\nOne year later it carry five million cars from New York to New Jersey and back again\nThis week in Nineteen sixty two in a televised speech of extraordinary gravity president John F. Kennedy announces that us spy planes have discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba\nKennedy announced that he was ... quarantine of Cuba's to prevent Soviet shift for transporting any more offensive weapons to the island was known as the Cuban missile crisis essentially ended on October twenty eight when the Soviets announced they would dismantle and remove all weapons in Cuba\nAnd this week in twenty twelve Lance Armstrong is formerly stripped of the seven Tour de France titles see one from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand five and banned for life from competitive cycling it was a dramatic fall from grace from the one time global cycling icon who inspired millions of people after surviving cancer\nThat's your look back at this week in history\nKatie okay on line on ... radio brought to you by the law offices abroad polston IRS tax problems visit polston tax dot com\nGlenn back [noise]\nYou know uh we had a we have ... we had the governor Abbott on with us and ah he said mixed inside of that seven thousand you know migrant caravan\nAre MS MS Thirteen leadership and members embedded in there are these are actual gang rape is\nNow I'm waiting for the left I Can't wait for the left to pounce on this how dare you say that gang rapists are in that care of him when they had absolutely no problem\nCalling someone else a gang rapist without proof\nJust recently had a problem I thought that was okay no I thought that was fine\nAnd with MS Thirteen they are getting rapists we know they are\nCertainly some of them are for sure well I think that's part of any anger and some of them are rapists\nYeah well I think that's part of the thing of getting in you have to you have to rape to to join the rape and kill\nA pass on this year's the subscription I I I don't need the member sugar free though all you have to do and I had no say no thank you kill is what are they going to go a different direction okay has MS twelve available you know no no no they're driven out on [laughter] yeah yeah I mean that's the I mean\nYou know we've talked about this before him is thirty in the United states constantly is is this is just the Donald Trump fever tree this is nothing [laughter] it's not a big deal where they're killing people at four times the rate as of school shootings so if you think MS Thirteen isn't an issue\nProbably don't think school shootings or an issue which I tend to hear a lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause\nUh for them so I mean I like ... the real issue I mean and this goes to a a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in there that's to say that again come in that way you don't come in that way that you have to have a process to be able to decide whether people should come into your country or not\nThat it's not are not hateful they have if you have a problem if you look at our if you look at you know a\nBlack Friday and say oh my gosh people are animals getting into a Walmart yeah\n... that's what this was going to be Seventy five hundred people try and just to push through an opening those doors that's all they're doing a list is Black Friday Wal Mart\nSays it going to be fascinating to watch because you know there's a good chance that you know as as Greg Abbott talked about that you know Mexico doesn't want to deal with the pressure from the United states and the ... issue they're going to try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome that are not on our borders because you know what that is\nThat's the Palestinian people yeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that it's uh not anger us right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and then you end is going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor tech I Know I Know that so I Know I I Know dumb reason to believe it's possible but let's see if it doesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border this thing has got to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like\nOur our border guard are are are National Guard of the worst\nOn earth and are not going to stand for it and like my job I got a van for Seventy five hundred people trying to run over our border guard either they're not a ... that is a that's got to be a real mess where he just goes wild [noise]\nYep that's how I deal with my problems while they go away it's

century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative video content\nUm that out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these tech company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they ... they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else well what we were trying to\nDo is I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some friends and conservative content so we said\nYou know if we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we want to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play in the apple store but I think this is I'm a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your your tips so\nAh the blaze channeled benefits because the view counteract you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this we're we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team and our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your contest\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um\nUh it is um [noise]\nUh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say hey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together\nUm because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions or so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be a if if it's known as a conservative thing\nOnly conservatives are going to go there so how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first pick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with a swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this as a Bernie Sanders ... light\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this um and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys name that was all about the contest\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really sweet mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with a contact\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going\nYou know they can't sell that we can sell the libertarians two ... two older than you know all this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there's a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take charge\nYeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um and does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who may go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next ah conservative or libertarian generation so here\nThe update dot com or let me let me I'm\nA switch topics with you because you know you've consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera\nBut do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no way\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat and so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media saying\nIt's always about local that as a the Kavanaugh saying coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism stock going to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think that Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the currency just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat I can you continue to vote Democrat\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean he's a radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in ... district and these are we went to a machine shop\nAnd these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump but I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter so I just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nI hate to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president\nAnd ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up\nStop it I mean I think the president's made it clear where their country of laws or or not and it it you know the the ruse that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people to their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or their asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which will be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states about sending money back to their country uh I don't even\nKnow if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at the the the the politicians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba\nThey've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThere 'cause they're carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately or refugee and I got to Mexico in Mexico was willing to hear my case or process me\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took ... you know myself or my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way the United states and right you know singing Honduras national anthem\nYeah it's not this is about politics and who's funding them yeah it's a great issue but\nI'm the president should stand strong and stop it if they make it that far [noise]\nAll right but the uh the name of the ah athletes launching went this\nWeek yeah launching this week you can go to the update dot com or you give us an email address and we'll send you early access into this week when it hits both um the apple store and Google Play\nGreat thank you very much for coming by thinks All right it's a the update dot com\n\nCar I let me tell you a little bit about to American financing I'm I'm very concerned about some things I'm going to sound insane\nThe shortage of dollars a there is a shortage of dollars coming and I know that sounds crazy because we we been printing all these dollars where are all these dollars\nWell the problem is is the government keep spending more and more dollars and the government is looking for people to buy our treasuries which is a giant loan with US dollars\nAnd so the more we spend the more dollars the government is gobbling up also because all of the banks took out loans in US dollars I'm Sorry not the banks of the other countries the emerging countries took out these giant loans in American dollars\nWe're never gonna [laughter]\nI Wish you well we do\nHave
