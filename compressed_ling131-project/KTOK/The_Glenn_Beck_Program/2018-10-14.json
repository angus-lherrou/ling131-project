journalist ... the Washington Post contributor disappeared earlier this month after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nUm it is not a new invention from us I'm like a laser sites have been over time but\nWhat what we're good at is making things at work or make things that have been thought through from an engineering standpoint\nUm and also from a quality standpoint um if you're putting that on your firearm dislike are laser lights for personal defense you're really needs to work when you want it to show we took that same approach to the engineering and the acquisition of these products as well so they\nThey're not um they're not anything different in terms of quality that you would expect from ...\nWell that's interesting that's kind of burying the lead as we say because to say well you know they're not different from what you expect from us except that what you expect from criminal trace is the very best you guys have always been I mean you're so top of mind when somebody sneaks laser site a weapon amount of laser\nThe crippling price because you're it's been your category\nSo you're there's a real responsibility I mean you're the guy at the top and you got to be looked at this and thinking you know what we are now asking the firearms market to trust us in a new area because you have an enormous bank of trust there\nAnd that's got to be a daunting when you're thinking about bringing out new products\nYeah it's a big responsibility and one that we take seriously and as you say is the market leader and really the innovator in laser sites um we went out it took our time a way that it with the\nThe idea that our customer who trust us for what they know us for today is going to trust you know we hope is going to trust us for something that they don't know as for today but that\nThat goodwill that we've built up over all these years and the expectation of quality of customer service to her customer services as good as any ones in the industry um if anyone ever has a problem with our products or thinks they have a you know any issue with their products we're here to stand behind it all of those things\nAre being brought to bear on the on the opportunity for the new products for example a rifle scopes a lifetime warranty\nOn those are our electronic sites that same warranty as our laser sites you know three years but really if you have an issue with it and and you know it's a product problem just like we do all the way through will will find a way to take care of you know so\nIt was a big responsibility for us but you know is what we do every day so um we didn't really need to change our our philosophy we just need to focus it on a new set of products\nDid you were able to tap in because I mean I've been to your place there and you got some really really smart folks there were you able to tap into that bring trust on what to include and what to do with these robots\n[laughter] yeah you know we were fortunate in like a lot of companies in the industry where some of our engineers uh most of them and a lot of other products people in particular in customer ... a support people their users their power users of our products um you know Gary killings worth and different people who have been on the show\nFrom time to time um he's actually a gun site right now are putting the products through the paces so\nWe have that that brain trust of engineers and product people in customer service people who also listen to the customer uh we we you know it isn't it isn't always what we think very much for the customer wants\nAnd over the years we've heard when we've asked you know what what else might you consider from crimes and trace and your products that were coming out with work we're always on the top of the list and um you know now is the right time with\nA new ownership and and really just a a kind of a new chapter for the business to go after those markets\nWell it's interesting it also comes an interesting time of course you've got products here for three gun which is usually popular uh obviously for rifles but I Am seeing real increases serious increase in people\nWho are willing to put a red Dr site on their self defense carry customers are you seeing that are you hearing that\n[noise] you know we see more and more of that um it's it's interesting to see different manufacturers glock and others who are is our parent companies are the key from Smith in Washington or income comes out\nWith a slide that's already a cut for these kinds of optics so\nYou know it's something that they are the consumer is asking for it used to be a customer's Asian and sometimes not a very simple\nCustomers Asian now as you say more and more people want that I'm not just for the three ... and the other guys who are helping using these for years but for concealed carry product um laser sites are great not everybody may want to lose your site and so these are as a ... or cited in low light but they're they're finally a little better during daylight\nYeah exactly so All right so ah are you calling this anything special a different name or they just call crimson trace read outside\nYou know so they're they're branded crimson trace a wave after you know almost twenty five years of using the same brand in the same logo on it made sense to upgrade an update our logo so you'll see a slightly it's the same name you know the tea\nOr his are kind of marker brand bark but we've we've changed a little bit updated it and then also added three ... three focus categories kind of sub categories protection tactical and sport\nUm that that moves us and expands us into those other markets so\nAh today at least all the products are ... are coming out in the crimson trace brand um we we felt like you know the boundaries of the brand can extend to at least these products categories who knows in the future you know what that may look like 'em but these are very much crumbs a trace products with again everything that a customer would expect from concentrate\nIt ... with the completely unsaid but more to come\nI Would say that's right that's right [laughter]\nWell and congratulations it is and it's a really cool product lodge a whole line of products from groups and tribes and obviously a zillion of people have your products on their guns already so you're going to want to take a look at this and maybe corporate this into their their packages [noise] well\nWe certainly hope so uh the products will be starting to flow in the market come November and into December uh so you know we're talking about um first in this case and then start delivering them in a in a month or so but yeah I'd I Would invite the customers you know and even those who who may not

shotgun pistol grips stock collapsible stock\nOptics wait wait wait what back the back of trucks up\nJust for slugs optics such as red dot sites are a viable accessory because of the small precise aiming point only single focal plane often results in greater accuracy of distance but for him to fit scenarios where buckshot his shoes to combat distances your shotgun standard besides it's perfect\nUh no I'm wow\nSaid no one has ever been to a true defense of shotgun school\nThe standard being a shotgun is the lousy citing device and if you need to make a head shot or half I had shot\nWith buckshot you'd need precise aiming that is if you have a hostage situation when you know what you're doing and you know what your gun shoots and you have good sites of some sort on your shotgun you can use half of the shotgun pattern\nTo slip past the hostage could take out the bad guy done it many times on the ranges you obviously it's wonderfully effective for slugs\nPut a shotgun shooting a very small pattern inside of a room I'm Talking about the size of your hand maybe maybe more like your fist\nYou need to be able to have it well\nDo you need to read that I don't know do you need sites yes you need some kind of ... a barrel barrel or a beat is not it he goes on plastic\nObject front site OK yeah you know which is which is interesting 'cause then it says why recommend the access to the doctor ... yeah we're the we're sight of some sort go shrink sites you said you don't need groceries sites really how\nAre you going hey how are you going to name I'm\nA ... do you like really\nYou really don't know anything I'm Sorry you don't want just because somebody puts on the Internet and in this case somebody who actually writes for dinner a magazine\nDoesn't mean he knows what he's talking about take these ideas or go to ... go to sick academy go someplace where they teach the stuff you're going to find that you absolutely water sling you may have to carry somebody or pick up somebody or do something with your hands the sleeping on the long run is a holster\nThat is the whole stricter gun just to see what you have a place to put your hand gun slinging is where you put your long gun when you need your hands for something else\nSo just be careful I guess the bottom line is just be careful about what sources you believe to be careful about which

granite bay California H. D. and you're on TALK\nHey I'm a I'm I'm picking up a Ruger curbing the new one that pick on one on Tuesday I got a vortex strike fire to read that last night and I'm looking through it\nAnd it looks like a little short line or a little ... I thought wow so it was wrong with Charles looking on the Internet mhm habit of stigmatization\nAnd ah then what they said if you look through it and you happen to stigmatize on and you rotate it mhm and it doesn't move your eyes yeah fits moves it's the site\nThe look on the line look a little bit like a coma almost like a\n... yes yup yup it doesn't yeah I did not realize that [laughter] yeah [laughter] I got out at home when I go what the heck yeah now do you wear glasses\nYeah and I ... I Do and I put them on and as long as I've got the progression bifocals I retired before about that and if I look through the top it's not bad\nIf I kind of look through the bottom you know for close rating denied that it it looks like it almost looks like a like a flattened circle mhm with the opening in a mental\nOr God that you know to look at that time ...\nHow long has it been since you were at the I doctor\nA about a couple of years ago and I do show I'm going to bring that up to um\nYeah there you go there and tell them what your city and tell them what's going on um and it may be time for a new prescription uh yeah I'm familiar with ... and were points of light ended up looking like lines are commas\nUh yeah well here's what you hear to pick your glasses and it's a good sound weird uh but when you're looking at something turn your glasses like on your head so it's like you're turning left and right and ... and you will actually see the line move\nBut eh yeah actions slides back and forth but just weird stuff that people like us who wear glasses do now and then going oh that's kinda cool\nOf that Mercedes door bank vault quality to it\nIt does I carry six in and to a Kimber

don't shoot it because there's no telling\nForced the heat of the fire did to the heat treating to the tip of the steel is complete unknown and there's no way to find out I Would probably want to keep it as a wall hangings do that but I Would place in the church so whenever you have to do but I don't think I Would\nMake them shooter anymore it's just kind of my take on\nSauce on guns is fires let

Montana Hey Greg what are you thinking here\nWell I wanted to comment again about the another point that Democrats anti gun Democrats use\n'em it's I'm sure it's the same in other states but okay there's a a woman running against our income incumbent congressman are are the incumbent is a a Republican very pro gun guy\nAnd this woman Kathleen Williams is a Democrat that says oh I'm a gun owner and I'm a hunter\nAnd she says I own a a twelve ... twelve gauge whatever its semi auto shotgun I imagine she uh you know use it to hunt bird with or something but she also wants to ban a our fifth teams\nWill yeah and and I remember even\nWhere you know here's the deal anytime come politician says well I I Believe in the second I support the Sacramento but\n[noise] yeah well it means\nForget everything I said before because I really don't believe in a more do I want to support the second amendment because I Do want to take your guns away in this case and that's an old boy did they I'm a hunter\nWell you know what every time I hear politicians are off with that I Know that he or she is\nTrying to scam is because it has nothing to do with hunting I don't care if you're a hunter show your concealed carry permit\nI Want to see that show me you're a are Fifteen show me when we're gone shooting because the rest of it means nothing to me the fact that you're a hunter that's just pretend that it probably doesn't even almost tell you probably just not even have a hunting license\nI uh by the way I also called my Republican senators office and uh [noise] old tried to tell him you know through his employees\nTo uh to prosecute these people that were the wires than in any of this cabinet case you know take the take all the Democrats to task and and uh you know\nLock them I I yeah I Would love to have an investigation say okay how did this a confidential information get leaked who didn't who had copies of who had copies of a doctor Ford's letter who released that\nA track him down hold him responsible because here's the deal if the Republicans won't do that they don't know how to lead they don't know how to win now will say I would give them credit to appreciate the call they did win this morning\nAnd they played the politics the way it had to be played and it was driving us to praise those of us who are watching to go home I got you got your drive me crazy you know kids who just well they did where they had to do okay and\nThey are playing a game that has a set of rules some of us don't really understand if you're not there you can't quite understand it All right hey if you're on hold right now don't go anywhere okay 'cause I'm going to get you straight into the ... I take this next break if you're going to have to leave us now here's what I Want to say\nLet your centers no if they voted for judge Kavanaugh that you appreciate let them know that you're going to

sounds Fox News it remains to be seen what happened to a journalist who walked into the Saudi conflict in Istanbul, Turkey and never walk down a\n[noise] now you will not need to run out and buy these books and read them cover to cover although you could let me tell you what he has to say because it has profound meeting for you and me and a really profound impact on the ideas of the everyday investor [noise]\nYou said that we all place too much weight on the odds that past events will repeat win on repeatable chance is a better explanation\n[noise] do you assume that the markets will continue to always go up that any downturns are temporary the bull markets continue forever or you do not even think about the risks\nEither way danger lies ahead Taleb a argues that the markets do not factor interests that are not measurable and that most of the really big events in our world are rare unpredictable and not measurable\nThese advanced when that happened usually have a very significant downward impact on the investment markets are you probably remember what happened um on nine eleven of two thousand one\nTotally unpredictable [noise] but this is one of the\n... the very big reasons why we spent so much time encouraging you to get off of that train and shift the risk to someone else shift the risk to whom we work with a billion dollar companies that will take the risks\nOff of your shoulders and guarantee you that you will never lose a penny of your investments due to market risk they'll guarantee you an annual return\nOf up to seven percent on a lifetime income account\nAnd they'll guarantee to pay you a lifetime income that you cannot out live\nSounds awfully good doesn't it will call me at eight seven seven five for a safe\nAnd find out how it works that's eight seven seven five for eight seven to three three these large companies provide many guarantees\nYou remember pensions so have you have 'em but uh they're pretty much gone now so so many people are struggling today to find a way to know absolutely know that they will have income as long as they live\nAnd having these billion dollar companies willing to guarantee you a lifetime income provides a lot of comfort a lot of a relief\nAnd a lot of peace of mind for my clients [noise] but uh back to ... have you heard the term black swan event or that term is what he calls these events that are rare and unpredictable\nThe term refers to seventeenth century idea\nAnd tell the sixteen hundreds it wasn't accepted truth that all swans are white in fact ... are white had been used for a long time as the standard example of a scientific truth\nThe equivalent today might be the earth rotates around the sun today would call that an indisputable scientific truth so what were the odds have seen a black\nSwan at that time well impossible to calculate but are considered impossible until sixteen Ninety seven when explores found black swans and Australia imagine that they had a black swan event\nFinding black swans and Australia when that was considered impossible as I mentioned earlier we had a black swan event in two thousand one didn't wait [noise]\nAnd we're having many others these days\nOr if you live in the uh Oklahoma City area like I Do a you know all about the earthquakes and the other day I think we had five in one day\nA and there's volcanoes not here but elsewhere

buying a home is one of the largest purchases they will ever make\nWhat risk do you have when you buy out for one\nYou have risk of market value lost\nA lot of people learn that in two thousand eight right many people thought that there was no significant risk from home values going down but that perception has now changed\nAnd what about risk of property loss flood fire and those dreaded earthquakes that we seem to have every five minutes around here when storms and that\nThere are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment other properties you don't have the same risks if you own a car a boat and\nFine have you on an airplane or about my condolences but anyway if you own any other property with significant value there is a risk of loss when you're on something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you probably know the answer insurance right\nInsurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they were probably never used so why would you buy insurance on your home you might say well I have a loan on my home so I have to buy insurance on it\nWhile that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for would you still buy insurance I think you probably would why\nWhether you realize it or not you would buy insurance on your home because of something called catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that you have a chance even if it a small to lose a lot of value in other words money\nIf something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our homes is because the cost of insurance is very small\nCompared to the last we might incur if a catastrophe happens so for the fun of it let's let's assume you live in a modern home up to current building 'cause you don't smoke and fall asleep in your bed you don't light candles and leave them unattended\nAnd you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen if I'm describing you there's a very small chance your house is going to catch on fire even so I bet you have home insurance and the reason is because losing your house\nWould be a catastrophic financial last so the relatively small cost of homeowners insurance is worth paying for am I right well you know I'm right\nBut let me ask you another question why don't you have insurance on your retirement money shouldn't you\nShouldn't you call us now for
