about to a few years ago there were about four hundred and forty Web sites that were entered into the international group it's called the environmental systems research Institute they're the ones that create all the GPS technology that she is geographic positioning systems where you know where you are when you're when you're trying to find a location\nOn your telephone on your smartphone sure they're the ones that provide all that\nData there is there an amazing company they're international and they've Mac everything in the world they they can they have an incredible program for economic development where they have\nA generations you know ten Fifteen Twenty years ago aerial images you can see the kind of broke this happening in areas so companies can determine whether they need to put their new\nGas station or their new or a big box store for retail stores it's an incredible thing yes our eyes the company and they asked everyone to participate in showing what they do as far as management of public records\nAnd we were one of four hundred and forty a of companies that or entities that ... that entered the competition and then in the United states there were only two\nJurisdictions that are in this international award and we were so happy and pleased that we are in the right to be a winner in Oklahoma and uh what with another a entity in the United states to winters out of four hundred and forty it's it's an amazing\n... and what it does is it shows you that that we are providing a an amazing amount of public records on a public access site\nThere's no charge you can get it three hundred and sixty five days a year seven days a week and that's part of the reason the real truth really love the Oklahoma county ... page because they get so much data so much more data than they can get in\nSo many other counties in the state of Oklahoma and it's also free of charge and and will do everything we can to make sure those records are available because we pay for him when I was a reporter at the Capitol and we used to visit time to time when I was a reporter out there covering the the\nCapital for Katie okay I helped write the open records law and the records law indicates that if you have it electronically or if you have it on paper you are required to provide that to the public because the public\n... the only thing they have other records that that show where the the money spent shows where the the records are that that that provide the the openness and transparency for our citizens and it's very important for for everyone that's involved in that\nHas the responsibility of owning property you can see on our website\nThe sales in your in your neighborhood you can see the trends that have happened over the last Fifteen or Twenty years so you can see why you know why your property is either going up and down you were going down in value and nationally\nThe that's the five Fifteen Percent is the usual appeals rate thirty thousand people wanting to peel their their values down in uh in El Paso County Texas in Oklahoma county our appeals rate this year wasn't five percent it was Fifteen Percent it was point zero zero zero six percent\nAnd that that to me means that people are seeing the records they understand what's happening in Oklahoma county Oklahoma counties or one of the ... beneficial or of it as as things have Oklahoma county is that people want to move here\nPeople want to buy property here because they think it's going to go up in value where they want to have a house they want to buy a house they want to invest in real estate where they want to start a business and that's really what our website does provide so much information for those people who have a dream of a house with a ... a business or an investment\nTell before it seems like we've gotten off track what is your responsibility and why does this make you want to run for the head job which is counting assessing\nThe ... century job's pretty important because the the job that we do to assess property every year\nIs the the funding mechanism for public education Seventy cents out of every dollar\nIn Oklahoma counties in the property tax goes to your local public schools\nEnd of the technology centers the other parts go to cities and towns to pay their sinking funds or judgments some of it goes to the city county health department other parts go to the library system ten cents less than ten cents out of every dollar goes to operate the county\nAnd you know provide all the law enforcement each the sheriff the operation in the jail and all of the county officers and all of the county departments that we have in Oklahoma county\nIt's an extremely important job it with out without the ... job there is there are no values without the values that\nThe property tax bills from the treasures office can't be calculated and without the property taxes collected by the treasurer than the school system can't operate and all of the other functions that you know people\nLive in Oklahoma City they live in you know Edmund or Midwest City Miguel or looser or other cities they\nDon't understand that there are a lot of people in Oklahoma county that don't live in a city\nThey live in an unincorporated area that's the responsibility the county you take care of\nWe're the ones that are responsible if the if there's something bad that happens in a in a in an unincorporated area when they call nine one one they don't call the police department they call our local county sheriff's office and the importance of having that safety\nNet that that that law enforcement entity in some parts of the county that that's the only law enforcement they had an ad for Oklahoma\nWhich is a hugely rural state\nThat that's a lot of counties in the state where the only people they have or their local county government to be able to provide their services and that's what we do\nInstead of the assessed there is in charge of making sure that all this happened\nYes ma'am because the assess er begins the process when we assessed value we uh we to turn on the market value based on trends based on all sorts of data we collect\nAnd then when we assessed that value the value is used to calculate on on the ... that are provided by the citizens most of those are mostly constitutional and by the voted the people if you want to increase your property taxes in Oklahoma county we can't do that at the county you actually do that yourself\nYou have to have a sixty percent margin of of a vote\nTo be able to increase property taxes the legislature doesn't want to make it very easy\nAnd Everytime you vote on school bond issue\nIf you you have to have a super majority of sixty percent\nAnd then when when voters do that support their local schools to build a building or if they're in a city and they want to build a road or a bridge or or creating new building for the city because cities can usually can't pay cash for huge building projects so they they they pass a bond package that's paid out over time\nAnd our job when they pass a Avon package is to allocate a portion of that\nThat bond package based on the value of the properties so those individual entities pay those citizens most property owners will pay off their obligation of that bond package that's been passed by a super majority the voters\nHow many years have you been at the ancestors office\nI worked at the centers office with to assess the first one was Mike means I I was his chief deputy I was brought on to bring in the the\nNew technology

easy\nThey are they have to do with the mapping they have to do is shutting down used for commercial properties residential properties and all of those those classes are required to be passed by the

commission too and I'm certified by the tag Oklahoma tax commission on day one to be able to do the job of the Oklahoma county ...\nSee I'm you've taken the why did you take these classes in the

I have no understanding on why it is\nA political party running at one way or the other because I don't know how assessing property values has to deal with Democrat or Republican a lot of times people just welfare that\nYeah that's what I Want to do when I go into the Oklahoma county assesses the office [laughter]\nNow tell me about your campaign what have you been able to do\nFor our I mean you know I've seen a lot of campaigns and\nAnd uh when you asked me what I've been able to do I mean we're running a\nA you know campaign or where are we do our best to raise the money or all all campaigns have to have money to operate has been a little bit harder to raise money on this campaign than some of my campaigns in the past because\nAh people don't understand the value of it and so ah people do not understand how important the role is to their lifestyle\nSo so it's a so there's been one of the CIA for campaigns to raise money for it but we move forward well here you know knocking on doors and doing\nA phone calls in the homes and so we're we're touching the bases and one thing that I realized through this whole campaign is a couple of things first of all\nYour radio listener audience is pretty knowledgeable because you keep it in front of the keep elected officials in front\nOf their face and you know they may not ... Leonard shelving yeah most people had no idea\nLimits element was the second ... and and not only did they not know who he was they didn't know what the Raleigh played all they know about him is that they received\nLetter from him at the end of the year\n... right [laughter]\nThey don't if they would open Atlanta they would get that letter and they said okay you got to pay all these taxes and it's gone up three percent nobody can tell you why your property tax\nThose up three percent every year without doing anything to your property and I think that that is the that is\nThey just true foundation in my ... ... of our campaign first of all\nMy Shelton being elected Mike Shelton will ensure that people know who their county assess or is\nBig large company after large company have an opportunity to have a lobbyist up at the Capitol and they ... and those those lobbyists come up to the capital to work with legislators to say hey give us a tax break it's their right to do that and you know what\nThey often got it but that same company would be not only after capital but it'd be a big city the city hall doors and they would be asking the city hey give us tax break\nTo to do it so that all of these doors and they're even at the county door asking for tax breaks on their pieces of property that they have and the fact of it is his everyday people don't get those kind of break so we don't everyday people don't have lobby ...\nSo and so so so I Want to make sure that the process\nIs fair and that the money they're supposed to go to public education from these tax dollars that people are ... that that that people\nAre getting a fair assessment ensure that these dollars are going to property taxes are going to public education ensuring that\nUh our teachers are getting their uh what they need our schools are getting what they are made they made and uh and our children are getting what they made\nIt so\nSpeaking I think the fact that they've cut their staff and all that how do you propose to make it better or not use the computers as match or add more staff or what what is your I I\nI of course uh I think that it needs to be\nA more fair about a more fair process for people and people shouldn't just see three percent when they've not may ... you know for no apparent reason ah it it they should not necessarily see a three percent increase because\nOf uh uh\nJust because they should know ex exactly why their property is seeing an increase from year to year and I think it has all to do with education\nWhat about education\nPardon me oh I had all to do with educating the or the or the like the public\nAbout why you're seeing these increases and not just because you're getting a piece of paper at the end of year and saying uh your property taxes going up three percent\nYes now um we talked about the fact that you represent a district Ninety seven some two thousand four to ... thousand sixteen I'm I guess to make is\nMuch smaller than a than Oklahoma county has this a campaign been a big adjustment to try to reach everyone\nI Oh absolutely I mean of course you\nA district Ninety seven is very unique because it's so diverse and it is the largest ah largest a\nDistrict a house district in Oklahoma county area Koreans are sees a idiot than it is the largest house district land mass up with that contain with an Oklahoma county\nSo you know you know a lot of those people\nI mean I Know a lot but you know of course you only represent thirty thousand different people are in the house race in\nThis is a lot more people and but what one thing that is very similar to the northeast Oklahoma City and looking at Oklahoma county is that diversity is here in Oklahoma City Oklahoma a in district Ninety seven\nI'm used to a a\nCelebrating as well as working for a diverse population is which is what you get in Oklahoma county\nYeah so we have a few minutes last ... tell us why you think you are the better candidate for Oklahoma county\nBut let me just tell you like this is that I feel like I'm the best candidate for this job is because I Want to serve all people\nI Do not feel like when I call it a\nWatch to a or has the will to serve all people I Believe that he wants to serve people like him\nAnd um and I want to make sure that your property tax is done is is a ... assessment is done fairly I Want to make sure that you're educated why they are your property tax is what it is and ensure that people\nAre all have a a understanding on how that office works and those are the things you are going to get with me we talk they talk about often in the er the website begin internationally will know and I I and I'm Glad that that website is they're just like a lot of people but\nFor some communities that website is being utilized to but to hurt elderly and ah in poor communities\nOut because they can because companies are going in there and going into poor communities and utilizing the street address and acting like they have some familiarity with the senior citizens and and other people are when they're selling their products they can go down the street they can\nTell tale of senior citizens the name of a neighbor two or three doors down\nA say Mr ... told me that she would buy one for me and she sent me down here when they really had no familiarity with these people they pay their going house to house with a list that the\nUh assessed his office and so I Want to make sure that we're not hurting our own constituents\nBy putting things out when I don't know where you live but mental health problems in Oklahoma\nAre real and I would hate for you to get a a stocker they've pulled your name off of the county fair for and they know exactly where you live\nI agree with you but let me ask you so how would you change it so it doesn't reveal than\nI and you know what I Am fine with the information that it provides the square footage that market value but one thing I have a problem with that I Will change they want is making sure that people can come from the William Faulkner lip or at least in this address\nAnd I that's what I Want to do just a couple of days ago when there was a man was a highway patrol officer that was allegedly stalking women using his his state\nPM cuter right 'cause he had access to their information\nI'm not saying he wasn't using accounting assesses website but you could I'm Talking about judges shouldn't have to uh I'm saying it made no body not not just important people like you might just important people like\nJudges not been port and people like the

find out more about your campaign representative Jim do to\nThem my shut WWW dot Mike shell two okay dot com\nGreat thank you so much for your time\nAlready and I appreciate your you're always so kind to me I appreciate what you do for the community and I appreciate your listeners for being in a the most consistent and greatest listeners and Oklahoma\nThank you invested in like on the campaign trail thank you thank you representative Mike Helton and I'm as he said you can go online and find out about his campaign I'm going all can leopard we've been hearing about the Oklahoma county assesses race\nAnd because we had great candidates we've learned a lot about what the county a sensor means to us as individuals\nI think we need to maintain a great deal of respect to anyway now we're going to take a break in here from Fox News and then I'll be back to take questions eight hundred\nAnd eighty no one think around you're listening to one thousand Katie okay\n[noise] [noise] no\nUse radio one thousand ... am and why family Ninety six boys want it\nUm and ah and but it uh it has a cap on it's a constitutional a fund also but this has a cap on the amount that can be put in\nAh the ah the revenue stabilization fund which was created a couple of years ago it it's based on a higher growth production taxes since you know it was done based upon the seven percent gp the which were not you know we're not there it's and it's got to kind of a five you're rolling average\nUh the reason that this is called third pocket is the third third top of fun with the same goal in mind but uh of what it does it um it takes five percent of the G. P. T. not you know of course on Colombia has a\nA has G. P. T. on older wells that are at seven percent on on new horizontal wells drilled I'm\nI'm at the current time or they have a five percent GDP gross production tax on those for the first thirty six months and uh uh but five percent of the gross a five percent of the revenues from the gp teeth so five percent of the five percent\nGoes into this vision find a ... and it also provides that ah that that five percent of the five percent will increase of the next year be five point two percent next year five point four percent\nOf it when you when you look at it there was a possibility that a one or the kind of a concern is that there's not a cap on that it does it say okay after ten ten years it gets to\nA you know six percent or seven percent of that five five percent of its kind of an an ending increase\nUh but that's how it's set up and then uh uh the uses for that fund is a is set up so that it can be used to uh\nTo you know when a when Oklahoma has needs a or one of the things that that this new fund this third fund that were voting on state question eight hundred provides that that are those funds can be actually invested into corporation so it's a\nUh in the past with rainy day fund a and the revenue stabilization fund those funds\nThose can't be placed in risky investments but the way that this is worded or these funds can actually be placed a a in a stock market top investment\nOr in a you know to purchase stock of corporations are not just Oklahoma corporations but ah but any top a corporation so that's a some people say that's kind of a problem with this I think that that probably the the biggest argument against\nA steak with an eight hundred is why do we need\nA third find\nThat um to do this\nWhen you know the rainy day fund works well the real the real limitations of the rainy day fund\nIs that that are that are that what they do is they cap the amount of money that can go into the rainy day fund and if we remove that cap uh we you know ... and tweak the the current rainy day fund we wouldn't have to have this\nThis third third topic but\nNow some ... I thought I ran ... we this would be the third son that that we never put any money in the second son is\n... how does that ... ... and that was\nCalled the revenues stabilization son\nThat's correct and we never had any money in it\nNow because uh because\nWhat had happened was it was a a you know and all of these concepts are good okay anytime you you you say hey we're going to have a at some point in the future a possibility that we're going to have access revenues\nLet's save those excess revenues and until such time that we don't have access revenues and we still have the uh the the needs\nAnd so that concept is good but the way that the revenue stabilization fund was designed a it really it it it's it's based upon a seven percent growth production tax it's based upon corporate corporate income taxes\nAnd also it ah some mathematical provision for a five year rolling average\nOf ... and ... and when you put that altogether it's not structurally sound enough to actually produce revenue to go into a fun so it's a it's setting there empty\nYou know do you have to remember who came up with the revenues stabilization some [noise] I Do\nUm it uh I Do ... it was a it was it was a representative or a from a lot and\nYou know what that is a is a name I\nDon't ... that is that's not the purpose of talking about it but [laughter] what a\nOnce again the concept is good when I save money when we get when we have access and use it when we don't have access\nTo okay I'm going against them and he gets it is [laughter] All right is it a person\nWho has the named Shannon in their name\nNo oh no I don't know who it is you know now I Know that [laughter]\nUh but anyway the the the concept is good and uh uh it's just one of those things that uh\nUh when we when we say we want to do this what we really need to do is we really need to take care of of our states needs and and we need to look at the uh the services that the state needs\nAnd and then we need something like we need the rainy day fund and we need to rainy day fund tweaked so it will do what\nIt needs to do so it will do what\nThe ah this stabilization the revenue stabilization fund was sold to do and so that it will do what this vision and we we don't need to have a bunch of pockets particularly when there's not any funding\nTo put them in there and we really don't need this type of fun because\nOf the risky investments you know but but now now I'm getting now now I'm a pioneering editorializing ah that's not what the purpose of our\nBut I'm enjoying it so much [laughter] but\nBut you know I mean we can so Fifteen pockets on our shirt and if we don't have any money to put in any of them it's just a a a bunch of anti empty rhetoric and uh\nUm well in in that regard um you know I think that uh I think we do need to uh to have some sort of a ... ability to\nKeep revenue what we've done is we've got we've got Oklahoma in such a such a dependency on things like the oil and gas industry just to you know a ... and and so to uh to to depend on\nOpposed of because I I Believe that it's it's another evidence that the state of Oklahoma it it is trying to abdicate responsibility to you state funding\nTo to to do the things across state you know the ... to to use the state revenues and to shift the burden\nOf of of public schools from that\nThough that state funding to local school district\nI thank you so much I'm we're at a time that thank you so much and thanks for shedding light on state question eight hundred and eight oh one yep thank you David term in a timely and writer for the Oklahoma observer you're listening to one thousand Katie okay [noise]\nUse I'm Kathleen Maloney hurricane willy is getting stronger and she takes aim at Mexico's Pacific coast\nIt is a category for hurricanes very dangerous hurricane maximum winds and you're a hundred and forty miles an hour a it's headed for the south western and west central portion of Mexico\nJohn ... the national Hurricane Center says the storm could make landfall by Tuesday the president of Mexico is ensuring safe passage to thousands of Central American migrants marching to the U.S Mexico border\nWe saw a riot police earlier today they back down we've seen maybe three five hundred cops here in a riot gear you didn't have buses and go away they have not stopped and they just overpower them with a number of people they don't want an incident\nFox is William ...
