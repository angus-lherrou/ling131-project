X. Y. fmri Ninety six point one age detail\nA trip to a celebration turns tragic I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News\nI saw um a lot of people up here at the apple barrel out in the parking lot and then I heard screaming a limo\nReportedly heading to a birthday party crashes in upstate New York yesterday killing all Eighteen people inside limousine\nFor many reasons across our state our party has been in the minority and some people had become disenfranchised and discouraged because oftentimes we heard over and over again when I went to my I'm polling place there was no one for me to choose from\nAnd what happens within the\nResponsibilities of the insurance department are so critical to every Oklahomans lives that they had a choice I Am qualified to do the job I have the experience having worked with fifty states and their insurance departments by a my investigations experience and I had the passion to continue to serve people\nAnd so bringing those skill sets together it was time to step up\nI made the decision to run um we've been very competitive as we go across the state\nAnd talking to people just reinforces that we need someone that's going to be an advocate for consumers and families not take corporate donations from lobbyist in the industry and ignore that we have some of the worst statistics in our stay with regard to coverage healthcare\nAuto in home mortality life inspecting the\nMaternal mortality and the list goes on and on and especially amongst our seniors are most vulnerable populations we need an advocate in that office and I don't believe that um the choice without having entered the race that we would have been given one\nIs that a reflection of of the party leadership or do you think that's a reflection on in the insurance industry and the way it was handled\n[noise] I think it's a combination of factors are clearly\nWith in all of our pot politics statewide we have too much money to many special interest groups that are influencing the conversation so that their voices are heard they have direct contact with the legislature and the people are often the ones that are left behind\nIn addition the office of the insurance department should not be political and it has been made political and that's something that needs to stop I frequently go across the state and when I'm In rural Oklahoma or wherever we're at\nOne of the things that is clear is that when you get hurt or in the hospital the insurance company doesn't ask you if you're a Democrat or Republican they ask you how you're going to pay and the quality of your answering your insurance determines the healthcare you receive\nIn what ways has the office become political [noise]\nUm well specifically my opponent has made it clear on his website that he wants to run the office with a ... a conservative political agenda and people's lives should not be dictated by politics\nIn addition over the last eight years as a legislator it is troubling to me as it is to many of my voters to know that she has been in the legislature making the laws favorable to insurance companies into one ensure in particular\nProfiting from the insurance companies working for an insurance company and then at the same time now he says that while he believes in the free market he wants to move into the insurance department and start protecting Oklahoma's there's something contradictory about that\nAnd in terms of how our rates have increased over eight years every Oklahoma has experienced their rates going up\nTheir coverage going down with or without any claims experience rural Oklahoma are low income our seniors women\nAnd many other categories are so disproportionately affected which is why we're highest in the nation's third highest and many categories and so there's something wrong where we not put the focus on protecting Oklahomans and that's what my goal is\nOf as we are here in the studio at night I had to say to you\n[noise]\nFox News I'm

Katie okay we we actually talked before the\nPrimary and I'm so bring me up to speed on who you are and why you're running and congratulations for getting this far\nThank you yeah and a thank you for its regulations but thank you for having me on an image has to share a story about yes we came out of the primary and we um\nWhen we have been out for well over a year or close to Fifteen months a traveling around the state and I'm visiting with a consumers and a insurance agents and folks and it's a community across the state uh in that I'm\nIn fact I remember you asked me in that primary interview what surprised me about the campaign I told you what surprised me was the size of our state [laughter]\nTake to get around them but um anyway we've experienced that but it's been really great to visit with folks about uh being trust department and or what they expect and in here from them as well to\nKind of share from my vision for the insurance department are going forward it's gone are extremely well we've we've got a a lot of support and and a and a lot of momentum and so we are we're looking forward to the election here in thirty days\nAre but [noise] you know my my reason for running a is\nI have been in the insurance business for thirty five years\nAnd ah in multiple roles and not just sort of a single\nI don't know as an agent or a broker for independent agent for thirty five years I've been an Asian broker and the um property county fire things I mean that's\n... ... to a a pastor a church burned to the ground up to a restaurant you have their life savings a couple of specifically I can remember and so you know we've we've had that experience and the ... side\nA and then you know really for the last twenty two years\nOr ... solely focused wrong really on the health insurance and a an employee benefits side of things I've been on the\nAn executive with to a health insurance companies here in Oklahoma so I have um sat in those executive committees with on the company's side I sat on appeal committee where we are feeling quite or or or consumers are feeling claims\nThat may have been denied a substantial experience that and that's the last nine years I've been back a self employed\nOr working with employers with companies on their health insurance and other employee benefits to maximize those dollars and um and really well he just working on behalf of employers for their employees so\nWe'll find a well rounded a\nWife as experience over thirty five years on all aspects of insurance business and then it this way I've been a legislature for eight years why of charity insurance committee and been exposed to some things ... with insurance that I have not experienced on the in my career business side so I think I'm uniquely qualified to serve in that role due to that\nThose thirty five years of experience from all aspects of the industry\nA statewide race is a huge commitment [laughter] what made you decide to run for insurance commissioner as the Republican nominee\nYeah it is a you know I having served for eight years now as a a in a house district which is about my district probably three miles by twelve miles wide but I'm not in a rural district so it's it's quite contained and that's a whole lot easier but you know campaigning statewide and\nGoing out to uh all the different counties and then ... them you know this thing of the different county fairs and in the fall here um you ... how big are stay there and how diverse it is to [noise] um but as far as why I'm running I I really you know just hit on that but I you know I think my experience that I have\nA ... a uniquely qualifies me we felt the urge to a number of people of course talking to me potentially about running a that would work with me at the Capitol or her them directions with me and my insurance experience but\nUm it was an option to serve the greater stage in an arena or an area that I Know I'm extremely well er into really game can focus to put that to work um in on the broader for the state of Oklahoma I was brought up I Want to seven can\nOr my dad was in the military but he also always served on some town committee and eventually you know basically city councilor roll and go\nAnd my family it wasn't about what your game to do and when you were right is or not if you're a service was when you were serving so I was kind of brought up with that mentality and so whether that's been\nA you know my nonprofit role served on numerous boards here in Tulsa I'm uh my wife and I were blessed to may maybe ten years ago and China's going to receive leadership Tulsa paragon award for work or big brothers big sisters so\nYou know a we're told that Oklahoma is one of the most catastrophic places to live because we have a you know we have all those things comes sweeping down the plane intend to affect us ah and\nThen there are the earthquakes that we've added to this how do you address those issues\nI mean there's there's no doubt that Oklahoma is in the crossroads a somewhat come up with some of the ... what we call on a street cat calling about cast catastrophic claims whether the tornadoes or hail\nUm and and some some wildfire stuff as well uh but yeah there are other states that have that too but um that that actually impacts the industry impacts are rates are because of how that comes to commissioner joke started\nA I don't know how long ago but maybe maybe shortly after he started a by the tornado something that has now become a national\nOr you know there's over a thousand people but come spring and and learn about how to deal with this and and the folks to address some of those issues a pick we're about to change the name of that when I when I was too\nUm instead of just tornado focused but there'll be catastrophe focused and so they'll they'll get a probably a dozen\nThe truth commission around the country each year that come into that as well or their staff since and other folks um but it but it's just a natural phenomena that we just we just have to deal with but I think also we we don't want to develop the image that\nInsurance companies don't want to do business here that this is just a catastrophe wearing that happened I don't I don't want to paint the picture and so I Want to be out there selling to companies to come to our state do business offer more choices by letting them know we're we we ... we are so vast or when you look at trials yes Oklahoma everybody saw the movie we have tornadoes\nBut we're not as bad as a\nAs some other places public perception is tough to overcome and I'm I'm not joking refer to the movie but there is sort of a national perception about Oklahoma and um\nI Want to try to I Want to present that data facts to dispel some of that and try to attract more companies that have had to come and do business here you are going to lose your whole book a business here\nWhat do you wish people knew about the insurance commissioners responsibilities [noise]\nOh I Would answer that against it a few things number one right on the gates would be that are here in Oklahoma we elect our insurance commissioner and I were one of Thirteen states that do that most most all other state I'm of the majority of states are they typically appointed by the governor an appointment position [noise] uh\nI'm In Florida it happens to be appointed by their CFOs CFOs liked him that he appoints the insurance commissioner but um\nBut there's a downside to that and that is that when I when I met with the I mean I see the national association of transmission is they tell me the turnover rate was\nAppointed position is really short like to the tune of two years on average whereas\nUh so so right now commissioner do having served eight years the insurance commissioner is one of the longest tenured insurance commissioners and the country or which is great to have someone who went to the national level on a model policy and things that are being done across other states and what their circle of agreements on so\nThat summer one is that we we are different in that were elected not appointed a\nI think I think people like to have a say so and so that would be tough I think to take that away\nBut it is like the other areas that um the department's responsible each state is a little bit different again 'cause it's it's state regulated so everybody's handles that slightly differently or you know in Kansas just north of us\nThere are also responsible for the banking and financial side and security side of things do come and we don't have that but we do have you know bail bondsman and we do have the real estate appraisals board\nAh and we have some funeral home stuff due to um ... policies and preserves trusted are being set up for that\nSo there's some other aspect that people don't uh don't typically\nDon't typically think of a and I think\nThe thing that I Would bring into play but the important in this in this role of having a person of integrity um we have a history here in Oklahoma of of having some folks insurance question of role that of\nBlacks and integrity and that has ... some folks in jail I mean you look at Oklahoma Louisiana um they they don't have the best track record there so I think that's important I think folks that know me\nKnow that that will not happen with with with me uh and I'm looking into um you can Google your candidates on the court system and the the uh and you won't see anything there for me I can guarantee you that um\nAnd I jokingly told some a group that I have to you can be guaranteed where I Am I'm In office I won't embarrass you I Know that's a low threshold\nBut given from past performance or a a nice piece at ...\nI Do find that a little humorous especially you know I think back to the county commissioners and all that too yes well I'm I think matters yeah how do you plan to get to vote at I mean are we going to rely on the fact that they're more Republicans in Oklahoma do you think this is going to come down to a ... you\nKnow I think ... and as I said earlier I have got some very strong part is bipartisan support 'em from leaders in the other party\nA and leadership and again some of that will be coming [noise] um but you can't just from having worked with folks and develop a great reputation and a lot of respect of my\nAh my lack of partisanship and my you know desire to do things um what's right what's best Oklahomans period regardless of party I think that has served me well and has um has garnered a lot of support from across the aisle and so we're not counting on that at all we've been working hard\nGetting out and meeting with folks ah or with that we have raised a lot of money you know I've got some indicators who's behind you and who's not and um we have been able to raise the money will also be doing some TV ads that will be\nOur our campaign the next to you know where where were thirty days out and so we'll be where we get on TV ads up in a drive that name id ah ah you know unfortunately [laughter] I say unfortunately but\nUm you know folks maybe just a little bit more focused on the governor's race on the insurance commissioners race [laughter] they they may not be as\nTuned in to a who claim already has one of my opponent is a and so we will uh will be running um al ... and getting me out there to ah to drive home who we are and who we are\nYou think that did terms and the president and all that well we'll a trickle down in effect Oklahoma races for sure\nI mean I it always does a and in Oklahoma or you know a a ... a President Trump is a very popular or ...\nOr something or holes is very strong ah right now and so on the dock that bodes well for me being in the Republican Party but uh yeah of course they can't help but ah but to go into and stuff but we don't have any intention to to do anything without a just cause some nothing because somebody gets out of our control\nAnything else you want to say before we run out of time\nThought well I I don't think so except that I think that uh you know what folks looking to go to my website ... dot com or I certainly could pick up the phone and call me but they will see the the the amount of experience and the very experience that I have I've I've had insurance license\nOr a ... license to wipe and health license for thirty five years\nI've been on the insurance company side a is an executive bent on independent agent side in another state on the property ... side of the time in Asia and burger in this day I was on the health insurance side\nThat I have a very well rounded thirty five years experience that I'm ready to put to work for the state of Oklahoma City consumers\nAnd remind us again where they can find out more information about you\nSure grandma already Glenwood want in a ... dot com\nAnd uh we have a website there and they can find out all about me that can contribute their own um access us an email or phone as well so\nI thank you so much for your time and a best of luck on the campaign trail\nGreat thank you for having me Glen sure appreciate it\nThank you represent a Glenn ... is the Republican candidate and his opponent is the Democratic candidates Kimberly tops they are the only two on the ballot for this particular race\nSo well I Hope that uh you've had an opportunity tonight to hear both of the candidates and it's very interesting very insightful now on the weather's side of things\nLet me bring you up to date about uh what is going on with the weather\nIt looks as though most of the weather for us is I'm actually to the west and north of the uh Oklahoma City area therefore I think oh you should stay weather aware but ah there is an acting\nFlood warning going on for various counties around here and of course we're going to have a lot going on here so you're listening to one thousand Haiti okay I'm going to\n\nUse radio one thousand Katie okay am gay X Y M M Ninety six point one and\n\nA tragic ride to a celebration I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News twenty people killed\nA individual sin and were able to get a a teacher pay raise in sports and raises for support personnel and some money for general education textbooks and so forth that uh uh that weren't on the table or until we pushed them\nSo let's talk about November six they because uh you do have a Republican opponent or do you have an independent opponent\nNow just a just a Republican I didn't have\nA primary and he didn't have a primary and so we are going to head to head on November the sick\nAnd have you all appeared in public anywhere\nYou know we haven't it ah [noise] ah there you know they're\nUm they're having there haven't been any forms in the district that have a uh have asked us to come forward you know we will appear in public together there's been a couple of prayed that a a a pony ...\nHas been in but you know it's it's not real high profile candidates\nAnd so um how we had the it seemed like to me let me just observed is that the teacher walkout\nAnd all of that pretty much took over the entire business and the spring and into the summer and how do you see that playing out in your house district\nYeah it uh there there was a substantial support for that both ah ah from me for them and and a lot of communication and coordination\nOr ... and also for a you know they supported me in that in and it was a it was a ... it was an unpleasant at all ah for me because\nThey knew what I was working for and I knew what they were working for you know kind of a mutated and a lot of a a a lot of the groups tried to make it into a teacher pay raise but it was a it was an increase in education funding is what they were after what we were we were after\nAnd uh I'm as I say you know there was a carrot thrown out in a group called step up that tried to you know really tried this\nSuppress the\nUh the capital of the ... growth production tax increase to only four percent\nAnd uh um\nBut that didn't do that really didn't do anything for education it ah it gave a little bit of money for a teacher pay right but uh that's where that's where the uh\nThat's where it was a difficult and ah that's where we stood together and we got to be a gross production tax increase to five percent and um and and we're able to ... to get more money for education than the step of reform that\n[noise] so do you see the teachers and every one remembering on November six how that all went down\nI Believe so uh you know that they remember to things they ... you know of course this month of uh of many people don't realize it but\nUh most of those races are being seen on their paycheck then in October and and that's just the the timing of everything\nBut ah they um they remember they remember a couple of things there remembering that they you know when they open their paychecks are saying that increase uh right now but they are also remembering\nUm how how difficult\nIt was it the capital and they're remembering how they were treated at the Capitol and uh you know there there are a lot of uh\nUh individuals who are saying oh we're we're a hundred percent for education but they remember how those those individuals treated them at the Capitol and so yes I Believe that uh\nUh there's a lot of uh a lot of a motivation there are a lot of uh\nOf of memory that are that will motivate people\n[noise] so what is the biggest issue in your district in\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... service in Norman has issued a flash flood warnings for\nSouth western kingfisher county in

did you get from there to soybeans I'm Talking to represent you may not Perry men these state representative for distinct fifty six and I I guess you could hear the war\nNow I couldn't hear that at all well like a nice\n... what what I said was uh as far as as the teachers are and what was your question was whether that will have an impact and I I firmly believe it will because\nOf those educators that we're at the Capitol number one weren't there for raises they were there for better education funding or for everyone's kids and are\nAre they one of the things that they remember not only are they opening their checks in October of ... teams and sing for the first time a a a lot of the raises and the support personnel are receiving those\nThose raises but they remember how they were\nAt the Capitol and and uh despite the fact that there are many uh many incumbents now that are saying oh they were a hundred percent education and you know they remember how they were treated how the ... the teachers remember how they were treated by the same or legislators at the Capitol\nRight now it would be a problem to to run for governor governor and twenty twenty six but that's just
