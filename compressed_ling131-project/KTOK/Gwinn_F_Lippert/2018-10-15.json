consulate two weeks ago but no one saw him leave Turkish authorities suspect to show he met his and\nYou're exactly right and when I got into this I've traveled across the state prior to this uh but it takes a commitment and I'm running for a job that I Know how to do and based on my experience and I say that because because I mean that you know for far too long we've had our legislatures and our governor uh\nThat have ignored the working class ignored the wage wage earner few will we've got to stop pretending to solve problems with catchy phrases and focus on real solutions\nIt's time that we could hiding behind the party see this is really not about the parties about the people it's not about Democrat is not about Republican\nI'm you've got to work for all the citizens and not just a special interest or\nA the lobbyists and so I guess the passion that I have my whole life has been representing in working for the wage earners in the working class people in this state that have been left out and in overlooked for way too long there has to be a balance\nYou have to have business to have workers and you have to have workers to have a business so it's not that you know I'm anti business I'm not that in any since the work\nBut at the same time you've got to have workers we have to make some changes in the state and quit ignoring things\nCan you identify something specifically that um the workers had been ignored\nWell actually yes when you look at the stagnant wages you you went to there's a whole host of things you can talk about um the minimum wage although the partner of labor is enforcement an advocacy when you've got a seven twenty ... twenty five an hour minimum wage\nThat's enough to make anybody depressed\nUh then we go and beyond that were the communities can't increase there so we talked about being competitive so we take that out but I think what really stands out to is\nThe so called workers' comp reform which by the way a Supreme Court has over ruled a as unconstitutional for most of it and there are still some that are left in there so really all that does it\nIt takes away the benefits from the workers\nTell me about the things that have been um the that they've found unconstitutional\nThe specifics on a I don't have them all listed out but there was a a number of them are on how they the the process in which they were changed it from the court system to administrative and that's still out there to be heard a there was a hundred million dollars on the cops source um that they're\nThey're gonna have to come back in ... the the citizens of Oklahoma are going to have to pay that bill\nSo\nI mean those are just a few of the things and\nYou know when when I talk to people on the floor or Alan form I talked to people out in the different county you know when you talk to people is working two and three jobs trying to make ends meet and you say that to somebody and they'll say well they're living beyond their means I'm not talking about fulltime jobs I'm Talking about two and three part time jobs\nYou know that they can't pay healthcare they've got to make a decision on they're going to feed their family go and buy insurance\nI mean there's got to be some conversation you know one of the things that I found that there is not transparency there\nThat's the bottom line and that can you can look at the ballot sheet on that one um what what do you mean by that\nWell you just look at look at the the phones the packs the money raised I mean compared to\nYou seem up from from the day I hit the ground it was about trying to get votes and when you look at sixty five thousand dollars plus a just in August through August reporting period for pac money\nOkay I mean the rice six other Nineteen thousand dollars for what many consider to be a down ballot rice\nOr again you know what's the experience level I Believe that I had the experience and the background to do the job\nTalking about advocating living wage you know people that I don't have all the answers I'll be the first one to say that\nBut I Do have the determination fortitude to bring the stakeholders unnecessary stakeholders together defined as the solution\nWhat everybody's input because it's not just one person's idea is a collection of everybody's input you have to have a win win\nThey teach you that in business they teach you that negotiations and you know what they should teach that in the legislature and they should teach that in government but obviously they don't that's pretty evident\nWe have about two minutes left of what do you want to make sure people know about a a labor commissioned officer and are you\nA flavor commissioned officer and to me is going to be foreign ... I'm not going to tell you what you want to hear unless I Believe it to be true I Will listen I Will be there for you to represent you try to eliminate the barriers that causes people or the frustration that get into now is going to be rosy cos\nI I closed in ... you you got two candidates\nMy opponent small business person been in the legislature for ten years talks about now she wants to be the labor commissioner but yet she\nWent anti worker legislation while she was in there she supported that she championed the workers so called workers' compensation legislation um trivializes roles in my view of the labor commissioner of roles and responsibilities just kind of a token eyes that\nMay I've been doing this for forty years forty years in the workforce I have a resume I have a background I have experienced but I've done everything right\nProbably not but you know what I've learned from it make a difference I'm from teachers school beyond the planning commission so I think there's some distinct differences again I'm running for the labor commissioner not for legislative seat not for something I Know nothing about the job that I Know about\n[noise] friend who has a Web

question do you want to grow your business [noise] new customers then try radio radio reaches more people each week to MTV or any other media checkout I heart okay the advertising dot com to get started today I hired cocaine the advertising\n[noise]\nNews radio went down from ...\nYeah okay forty one degrees feels like thirty five in Oklahoma City plus a little lower than two weeks away until the election and joining me this evening is representative Leslie Osborne she is running for Oklahoma labor commissioner on the Republican side of things\nRepresentative Osbourne thank you for joining me on a Sunday night oh boy did you choose to run for labor commissioner\nWell this is my fourth and final year in the legislature and during the years that I was there I ran several bills\nThat I'm One set up a new division and the department of labor about five years ago the compressed natural gas industry came to me and asked me to run a bill that would set a milder modicum framework\nFor people that were doing compressed natural gas vehicle conversion there was nobody doing any oversight they felt like it wasn't safe for the average consumer\nUh we'd shopped around different agencies and worked with the current commissioner at that time set up a new division and during that I got to know a lot of their employees I started finding out a lot of the scope of what they do and I just really love the mission of this agency\nFound out that their current commissioner Melissa Houston was not going to run for election and decided to file for this instead of my last two years in the legislature\nSo how would you define the mission of the agency\nA safety the safety of citizens and safety of the workforce a lot of people think that the department of labor is all about labor issues\nAnd that may well be what it was a decade ago when back when it was formed around statehood\nA but since right to work past and that's passed on the statewide ballot before I came into the legislature we really don't see a lot of arguments a lot of fights so lot of problems between union or non union employees there is a small division\nThat handles or any kind of clients that would come in um wage and hour on child labor laws that the vast majority of safety so they are making sure that somebody that's certified\nIs checking everything that we take for granted an elevator every year I an amusement park rides a boiler\nUm but then the other thing they do which is one of the really I'm shining light to something we do in Oklahoma a lot of states don't if they offer a pro active service\nThat goes out to small businesses medium sized businesses all across the state anyone in the public or private sector and offers free safety consultation services to keep your employees safe\nYou know a big company like a Boeing can afford a fulltime safety consultant a smaller company can't end this is a proactive approach we do in our state\nSo as the commission or what is your role in making should this happens\nWhile I Will tell you I Will not be writing any roller coasters\n[laughter] I've\nBeen scared to do that since I was a little girl\nBut uh but you actually oversee a lot of division there is a fantastic staff there this is an agency of about eighty employees with about an eight million dollar budget about a third comes from state appropriations about a third comes in from different facets they license\nAnd about a third comes in with federal grants for some of these consultation services so there's over so I but a lot of this agency is run by fantastic staff it's been there for years\nCommissioner Houston just did a fabulous job the last three years is green lining\nMaking this agency efficient um it's one of our true shining light though it's a job you can step into and what I Want to do is not go in and shake anything up I Want to shadow the different divisions that first get to know what they do\n'em before and you know make assessments and things like that before you would ever go in and say here I'm here to take charge and change how we do think this is an agency that's doing things very well\nSo what's your experience of in with I I Would guess has alternative fuels\nPart of the labor commission says okay oh did you notice that they had transparency and uh those kind of things that are important to citizens\nYes and that's another thing I'd like to commend them on for instance when this a department was set up and it also works with the compressed natural gas there is a tax credits\nFor companies that will build and expand the infrastructure in our state because you know our most prolific natural resources is comprised is natural gas\nOr we need to make sure that if people are going to buy the ... that there is a good framework of being able to get the fuel anywhere you needed across the state\nUh there's also one for people that do conversions I'm the one of the things I Love this agency did is they didn't just set the rules to send them out to everybody and say here's what you have to do what this agency did was set up lots of hearings with every body affected\nFrom people that own a compressed natural gas of fueling stations from people that were actual people that were doing the conversion from industry people from citizens that we're interested on how this might work from the department of uh\nBut it's extremely relevant\nIs that when I came into the legislature oil and gas for the biggest provider of jobs in the state agriculture number two because of the highly successful tax credit program that we started about a decade ago the aerospace tax credit\nThat has now elevated the number to create jobs in the state is aerospace number three agriculture\nYet if you go talk to people at ... am at Northrop Grumman they're having to hire a lot of people for their workforce from out of state\nNow that the problem for them they would much rather hire local talent they would much rather be employed our children but we aren't necessarily training our children to take those jobs [noise]\nUm so I've been reaching out to Marcy Mack the head of career tech having lunch with her tomorrow as a matter of fact in some people in the aerospace industry\nUh have visited with joy how much are the head of combination ... I have visited the OU school LSU school of engineering we have got to do things when we see a critical need like this about identifying kids in junior high\nThat are good and ... classes and showing them the trajectory they can take through our local career checks through our away you know issue engineering programs which are fabulous and actually training our children to take these high paying jobs instead of waiting for our kids to graduate and just seeing what they might want to go into\nWhat effect has the teacher's walkout had on the labor commissioners position do you think\nCould be on it probably uh not any more than it affected a lot of other agencies I was obviously there this last year I was one that I\nHad really pushed for more dollars to be sent to the classroom and more dollars\nTo be sent to teacher salaries are I think it is one of the huge reasons why we had so many non certified teachers in the classroom teachers didn't feel value and I thought that they needed a better wage\nThe revenue built that we passed a you know this last session\nUp teachers' salaries an average of six thousand across the state it went anywhere from five thousand for a new teacher to eighty one hundred for a teacher with higher degrees I think that was a huge first that I think that they are already seen an uptick in people wanting to go into education we need to recruit the best and brightest to be in the classroom\nAnd now the next step is to continue that journey to make sure that we're lowering classroom sizes are getting dollars to the classroom not necessarily to administration\nAnd continuing to value our children which is our future so you know the walkout I feel like we've made the cause of the walkout we made some great strides I don't think would have happened without it people\nCan say that we passed several of the bill before the walk out the would we pass them without knowing the walkout was going to occur I don't think so so I'm very very glad that we did that but we need to continue that journey and educated workforce starts with a well funded and well rounded education system\nLet me ask you this of as as you and I both seen those Republicans voted against the teacher pay raise or many of them had been defeated on their reelection do\nYou feel like the Republicans are going to ... that the voters are going to have a grudge against the Republicans continue on\nNot I don't necessarily think though I think that what we saw with her writing at the ship 'em I think that there is a huge divide right now in America between the parties but there's also a huge divide in our own party and I will tell you from looking at back at this historically\nYou know at this is the first time in history that the Republicans have held\nThe health in the Senate in Oklahoma for years and years and years for decades that was the Democrat Party if you'll look back historically when they had their largest majorities they also had its function within their own party when you're when when you're ... you tend to splinter\nThe splinter that grew over the last I Would say three years or so was within our own party on what to do about revenue so when\nA in my former job as House Appropriations chair we identified the problem has been that we had lowered revenue so much that we weren't able to provide the core services are are um are citizens expect that\nThen we had to write this yet so you often hear us here said we passed the biggest tax increase in state history now if you want to look at the sheer number and volume of that that's true but what they may not tell you is that we're still forty eight in the nation\nIn overall tax burden\nAnd that because of that revenue we only went back about a third of the way where we were before we started the nine tax cuts eight in the income tax one in G. P. T. I called that riding the ship and I think that the people that refused to consider\nGoing back a slight bit of the way where we had on the cat\nAnd remember we're still at five percent on income we were at seven nobody did anything about income nobody uh nobody should be castigated for that but I Do think that a lot of people were unhappy with the ones that didn't think we needed to do some thing\nNobody talked about massive increases but the ones that wouldn't even consider small increases to get those dollars education paid the price at the ballot box\nI don't think that will necessarily see that go further I feel like what we've seen maybe about all we will see for that because what we did with most of the ones that voted against the rather than you are now gone\nI uh am enjoying looking any [noise]\n\nJust nails surface attack I Know I've I brought this up last time but I it's the first thing on your meat Leslie page huh how you feel like the Republicans are supporting you in running for labor commission\nWell I Would hope so [laughter] I [laughter] I just when the Republicans ... run off yes\nAnd it was a hard fought because I had a very worthy opponent um I have nothing but good to say about Chappy Costello she's a lovely woman and there is not one person in the state that should have a better stronger voice for mental health services mental health funding than Kathy Costello\nAnd so that being said it was a hard fought race but I think that there are a lot of hard fought raises if you talk to a\n... I Believe there were eight people in the Republican primary through run off we're down to one Kevin ... almost all have solidified behind him in the party and most of the people that ran against a minor Mick Cornett officially endorsed him this week several others already had\nSo I think that any time you see run off that can get rather divisive that now's the time the last three months where we come back together as a party and said yes I felt great strong Republican support 'em\nIn fundraising and called them encourage meant so yes I think that that division we were talking about on a on the revenue bills we had to do that behind us now and I will not be in the legislature have anything to do\nWith those types of bills anymore but what I Would like to do is be trusted to work on workforce development keeping our workforce safe and working on licensure reform which is huge right now with what all we're doing a justice reinvestment\nLet's say Osbourne I thank you so much for your time and a best of luck on the campaign trail again for those that would like to see your website it is Osborne for number four jobs dot com or thank you so much on a Sunday night\nWell thank you you're always a pleasure to visit with very even killed and look at both sides and I appreciate you\nThank you so much for by a I'm going to talk and their lips hurt and uh I have tried to reach the independent and have not been able to offer him a the equal time so if anyone wants to send me his number or whatever I Would be happy to\nReach it as a and give him equal time as well so uh that is the Democrat and the Republicans\nFor labor commissioner and as I said it is a little more than two weeks before we will be voting on that you're listening to one thousand Katie okay I'm going talking or Lippert\n[noise]\nRadio one Belgians review am and why ...

I Would say they're\nThe a lot of the Democrats are older and later\nYou know the Democratic party has changed lock and president years and a lot of them are still you know still with the Democrats because of the old a Democrat policies that were in place because\nOf the day my parents used to run the state of Oklahoma I'm from Ardmore and it was a little Dixie same kind of thing so uh interesting so um have you always have been a Republican\nYeah um my parents um you know the the like I said that I'd been a entrepreneur I guess you'd say a from the very\nBeginning of my work ethics or work career that you might say I you know a a locked or the ban a lot to be you know we're the I can make a difference and I said myself making the difference\nAnd there's you know there's a lot of like to change and therefore I guess I get mine them\nEnthusiasm for a working with the state budget working with the the uh the governor and that he bangs\nOr we can be a more a better balanced

you be the only Native American in our house\nI think there was one other running a from a state of Oklahoma I'm not sure and you know a target and make a a there's another native ... running\nUm

government and go well you know where we need to do something and oxygen and we had something representation here and there and it's one of the lines were you know that's another part of my\nCampaign years of working with 'em back them up and down at the end you know it's going to crumble and like\nAre there many tribal members that are also Republican\n... this is true I Know I don't know I'm
