over the palm trees trailer park\nPayers could take months and years helping no escapes the forwards and [noise] take upon kill NATO Fox News\nWho are being impacted by some of these projects and the decisions that were being made of the corporation commission and it became very apparent and clear to me that their voice as not being heard and so I felt like it would be a good opportunity on behalf of Oklahomans and our environment to step up and make sure that our voice could be restored back to the agency\nSo your advocacy work is about the same information that you're PHD's\nYes yeah so I basically have for the past two years taking the skills and tools that I've acquired through academia and these other institution and I've taken them to the community so we've done\nA I work with other people and we've formed collective and grassroots organizations and we've done teach ins we've done workshops and skills that training stop the state\nWe've held several listening sessions um for the communities to come in here grieve their air their their issues and hear what they're I'm dealing with and so it's been kind of a a a\nA mixture of both academic and personal life and as a ... it's very\nVery um good time for people in Oklahoma to care about these issues and the good thing about Oklahoma and says I everybody really is community based and so they really do appreciate someone who is actually taking the time to come and listen to what they have to say and he really cares about what they're doing with no matter what\nTheir political affiliation is\nYes I always always found it very interesting that this office is a political party you know race or do you think that's necessary I\nThink it really I'm kind of ties it to some of the other issues that we're dealing with in the state of Oklahoma um because it is a regulatory agency I don't feel like it should be a partisan race I think that\nA lot of the partisan politics that um are you know may be appropriate for the other races the congressional races the governor race and\nThe house and Senate races I don't feel like those apply\nTo the corporation commission issue these regulatory agencies and I think that it does kind of um time your political affiliation to this race does kind of\nPrevent um some people from listening to what you have to say just because of that so it makes it kind of difficult and also for me personally um I I don't consider myself\nAn art and Democrat and so it makes it even more difficult for me to talk to the people I Need to talk to you because I kind of get a pigeon holed into the Democratic label and there are certain issues that I you know I really believe in such as local control I think that if we actually\nDid have local control and the state of Oklahoma that we would see a lot more protections for our environment because I've met all of these communities\nAnd nobody wants to fracking well in their backyard nobody wants to dispose of low right by the school and so if we actually had restored local control back to the people to Oklahoma I feel like we would be protected\nAnd so for me I think that ascribing a specific political labeled\nA Jew who your race for this position makes it kind of more difficult to really get to the crux of the issues at the corporation commission which I think are definitely nonpartisan\nYou know as I understand there are three commissioners correct yes now but but just as though only ... seats available at this time correct\nYes so they each thirty six year terms and each each two years every two years one of the commissioners race is up for election\nAnd so that's kind of a staggered commission and so right now Bobby Anthony seat is up for 'em reconsideration and then a few more years of another state will be available\nSo let's talk about the corporation commission because of until I started doing radio which believe it or not now it's Thirty years but uh I had no idea what the corporation commission even was so what about in interest you and how do you explain it to your constituents so that they understand\n[noise] yeah so I'm the first thing that I like to tell people is that truthfully the corporation commission is the single largest regulatory agency responsible for maintaining our economic status here in the state of Oklahoma\nUm because they're responsible for regulating the oil gas utility and transportation industries and because Oklahoma is very much in oil and gas stage they are very much in control of our future um of our quality of life\nOf our water of our property values and so when I tell people is that this is a regulatory agency and they are responsible for making sure that we are protected from the corporations that are seeking to make profit off of our communities\nAnd currently that's not happening because what we're seeing as a lot of the people in the corporation commissioner actually accepting donations\nFrom the very corporations that we're supposed to be regulating\nAnd and it's kind of making it difficult for regular Oklahomans to have a voice in the agency or a seat at the table and that's that's really what I have been encountering um throughout my race actually meeting these people\nBut you are very right most people that I'm In countering didn't even know the corporation commission even existed nonetheless what they're actually responsible for and so many people are very surprised\nTo find out that they hold so much power and the reason why I was as civically drawn to run for this race is because I Do care a lot about the environment and community issues and I'm also very interested in the way the industrialization impacts our communities and our environments and so\nKnowing that the corporation commission is actually the entity that is responsible for determining whether or not\nWe have for instance the saltwater disposal wells that are a byproduct of fracking\nUm there are also responsible for determining whether or not we create better regulations around the disposal of salt water and fracking wastewater into our ground and currently one of the things that I find very disturbing and upsetting and a lot of people aren't aware of is that\nThe corporation commission actually has made it to where five other states outside of Oklahoma actually able to dispose they're fracking wastewater into our Oklahoma land and so for all these issues um there are also responsible\nShoes on WGN but it could happen to anyone an official with the northeast regional Anti Defamation league and Bernstein decried the Pittsburgh mass shooting\nThis was not just the Jewish problem this is a problem with setting all minority groups not only in New York state New York city but across this

commission is Bob and he joins me now to talk about his campaign commissioner Anthony thank you for joining me on a Sunday night how has the campaign going\nHappy a joint you and the frankly the campaign seems to be going well um I don't really like poles but they show that I have a big lead and them at that are just means that people still need to get out and vote and they need to get better\nInformed and that's what are the benefit of your radio talk show is accomplishing\nWell thank you very much a tell us who you are and why you are the incumbent\nRight say I'm ... I'm Anthony and ah I grew up with the C R Anthony stores and worked in the stores and worked in the warehouse and worked in the mail room all as sort of thing\nAnd we had them as many as ... or ... locations all across the state of Oklahoma\nUh obviously I was born in Oklahoma I'm wanting to six brothers and I'm Nancy and I have four daughters and we even have five grand children at this time\nAnd um I have been a a businessman most of my life I had some um military service and um now I have regulatory service as well as the business experience\nAnd I have more education and my father just thought was necessary but of all of the eight people that filed for this office I think I have more college degrees than any of the rest of them\nBut uh it's not college degrees that I think more important than his business experience\nAnd a regulatory experience but really on top of that\nIt's uh honesty and integrity and a reputation for achieving things and getting results and having the confidence of people\n[noise] so as a condition or what do you do\nWell some people say the commission is the state's most economically powerful state agency and I think that's probably true ah we ... all of close to two hundred thousand\nActive oil and gas wells in the state we regulate and this is the one that people know the most about the public utility rates like oh gee in a in Oklahoma natural gas and other utilities frankly there's dozens and dozens of 'em in the state\nUh we also have jurisdiction over things involving safety and we've seen some unfortunate accidents in other parts of the country including Massachusetts wrote recently and I'm Talking about pipelines\nAnd railroad crossing every railroad crossing in the state is under I heard a authority and a miscellaneous things like cotton Jim's also the legislature gave us ...\nAnd uh those related things and uh so we have a a every gasoline pump in the state has a frankly the names of the three commissioners on it to make sure\nThat if you pay for five gallons you get five gallons and not four and a half gallons that would be cheating we checked the octane to make sure that you're\nA being protected as a consumer so in a real simple sense we uh protect consumers and we'd try to ensure safety and of course reliable service when it comes to utilities surface\n[noise] how many years and he served dancing corporation commission twenty nine\nTwenty nine and and uh why do you hope to continue\nWell first of all I'm proud of their service that I've already ... and you're asking about elections and why people run it and so forth there is something a little bit unusual about the way I have approached by reelection\nAh I Know that if you run a poll that uh all the incumbents are and members of the legislature\nOr can observe that there are is dissatisfaction and people have an unfavorable opinion about the United States Congress and about the Oklahoma Legislature in so many of the incumbents aren't even mentioning the fact that they're an incumbent of her in office holder that threw up for reelection\nI'm kinda the opposite I'm proud of the years that I have served I'm proud of the things that uh we have achieved and then they refunds and rate reduction for utility commission or consumers in particular\nAnd some people say well I didn't think corporation which had anything to do with that but we do we have a program that is that Bush is a Internet for schools libraries and hospitals especially rural hospitals\nI'm proud of the fact that in Nineteen Ninety nine my signature went on a commission order that established the thirty million dollar education information technology fund\nTo help schools and so far we've\nHelped to hundred schools state wide with the earnings on that fund and over five thousand teachers so there is a long list of\nA a ... impacts that we have an education is certainly one of them\nBack to earthquakes it's important to notice that Nineteen percent on a hundred percent Ninety percent of the area\nOf Oklahoma is designated by the commission is an area of interest and so you have to go location location disposal well by disposal well geological formations ...\nFormation to determine what's the right course of action if the epicenter of an earthquake is one that we think should be it\nImmediately and totally shut down we have done that and so we do take tough action or ... or\nDo you think that I actually have a friend in Edmond his or her whole neighborhood ... they they live on whales and they've been told that their wells are not good because of the salt water will close to it um how do you handle that or does that come under the commission\nWell I used to live in ... and I used to have vote will water myself so I Am sympathetic and understanding of these concerns and uh uh\nQuite frankly if an individual citizen or has a claim against an oil company for a situation like that then they need to ah ah take appropriate action\nNeighborhood yeah I think the neighborhood is the mission\nDoes not give money damages and so forth and so they need to talk to somebody\nOr but if they think that it an an injection well one of the most precious things in Oklahoma is fresh water and groundwater and if they think that there is an oil wealth it's contributing to some sort of a ... pollution or contamination should immediately called the corporation commission and will determine\nWhether or not to there's a anything going on you can trace\nA with a certain ... the water at the at the well an injection well and so forth so yes they ought to let us know\nOr if it falls in one of those categories of for us to do\nAnd I'm also the wind power and and all of that latest wind power issue with the dance air force base I found interesting ... were you all a part of all of that discussion\nAt the short answer is yes and you've given me one more reason to say why I mention my military background that I did serve in the U.S Army Reserve and I was in the air defense artillery are and you might say well how does that come into play yes\nI have met within the last month or two with senior officers advance Airforce base tinker air force base a Fort Sill and people that are involved in programs and my military background helps me understand what these or air traffic or a a\nYes patterns all lines yeah and and\nAnd so yes that says something we looked at matter of fact we have a whole lot to do and there was recently at task force study by the legislature and the governor that they called and they said that the the\nCommission is probably the most demanding a of responsibilities of any agency they found in any of the fifty states\nAnd that's why the voters ought to vote for the most qualified person and they ought to ask themselves whose experience who's got qualifications who's got the the biggest refunds and re reductions in the history\nOf the state natural the answer to that is me and if they want to know more about it they go to Bob Anthony dot com or on Facebook we have an enormous amount of information that talks about facts and results\nAnd who's going to get things done they need somebody who could and continue to do work at the highest levels we don't need people who need on the job training and my background in education and experience is economics finance accounting and administrators and\nI've also I'm not an attorney\nUh but I have studied and our trust law at\nA prominent law schools labor law or constitutional law and all of those things are necessary because the Supreme Court in Oklahoma says we're a quasar judicial\nBody what does that mean to do things that are legally sound\nNot legally sounds got you I Know they can use your help maybe only the legislature I didn't say that I'm so let me ask you it seems to me at the condition it's feast or famine that on the same day you might be dealing with earthquakes and then you might be able to rule a utility rates change or something like that\nI Would say every day we have things of major consequences going on or in the last five or ten years we've averaged having between ten and Fifteen thousand orders that issued those\nYears and that means we do ten or twenty or fifty or a hundred or two hundred orders a day\nAnd they're very technical their legal ... they need to have proper documentation and uh we do have a a commissioner majority signatures from the three of those there have to be at least two signatures to get something done has what the constitution says we are constitutional\nAgency and um\nI think I heard you ask someone else what their motto was\nYes sir I think ...\nI've had the same Otto every time and ... actually I had a couple of them one is honesty integrity Anthony like I mentioned before I've also said that my own special interest is Oklahoma\nI've never had anybody except recent opponents are accused me of being influenced our own to buy any special interest but most\nImportant ally I'm I think that ah people know me they trust me and I have a record or that shows of that my last monitor who is this give them justice and I'm Talking about the big companies we regulate\nGive them justice whether they want it or not\nI'm not afraid to ask tough questions with my business experience I Know some questions to ask that they just as soon not have to answer\nThat's very interesting so I'm One of the things that was said earlier and I you probably heard this was and it was said by ... years ago that we allow other states to have salt water injection here in Oklahoma that the corporation commission allows that is that true\nYes that's true and I've heard that and so I looked into it recently the amount of salt water injected into Oklahoma injection wells is about two percent\nAnd so I it as a red herring issue and uh it I Know there's less than five percent because obviously it does change from month to month but that that is not a wholesale problem uh and so we need to get\nTo a issues that are are central uh and I'll just tell you one that I think most people\nCare about the utility writes yeah and they care about\nRates the rates are only half of the bill the rest of the bill is fuel like buying coal to generate electricity or natural gas to put ... system\nAnd you need somebody that understands what a fuel adjustment clauses are purchased gas adjustment claws and so that we can look out and make sure that those things are fair\nOr is it right for somebody to have a gas purchases from their brother in law or their affiliate a transaction company\nAnd pay too much no that's not right that's not prudent somebody needs to know how to ask those questions\nSamantha need pick linear slogans and we'll wrap it up\nI think that the one that I Hope everybody thinks of when they think are bobbing up and he is honesty integrity ... that\nI think he can strengthen the best of luck on the campaign trail thank you and thanks to everybody who's listening I think he loved by you're listening to one thousand Katie a pay again a\nVote November six to heat them here and you're listening to one thousand [noise]\n\n\nOr you can track your absentee ballot if people by by absentee um so it's very good tools for for all those things\nAre we also question asked about of I'm also on our website um you can do that runs day which is the guidelines for that um and then we also have a really\nUm for folks to update the registration information now those won't be possible to hockey like this link that deadline pass already but that's another online to have and whether you want to come up I I just just keep up with your in the last couple of weeks is\nA that we're trying to get people to make a plan to vote or\nOne of those shirts shows that if people are thinking actively about how they're going to get to the polls how they're going to vote or they\nPrint out everything ahead of time it really helps to improve voter turnout so we have a a a link to that to make a plan to vote on a on a whole page and electric going fill out a PDF\nYou can check when you were going to vote by absentee vote in person polling place but during early voting and then we will give you a link solved without put up on your fridge later she and I did I took out the\nThat's pretty amazing 'cause you're right if I Know okay I'm a I'm going to go at ten o'clock or whatever it is I'm more likely to vote then as I say well the polls are open till seven I'll just get over there is some time and then you know how that happens [laughter]\nAnd watch the front of mind to people about it and they know that that's coming up and and they've you know they've got a plan to do it um oh that will hopefully help people not just get surprised and then you put it off on election day at your get get busy and that happens so which don't want to miss out\nLet me ask you this question I I I Know we laugh when a your Facebook when your birthdays on Facebook and everybody goes\nBut some people have told me well I'm not going to use that thing because you put your first day and your whole name there how how are you keeping that secure Brian\nUh well so\nThe information you're ... you would sit on your on my vote on like a virtual ... have in our system it's not going anywhere all it's doing it's turning our system and pull it out because we weren't straight ... public record\nSo if you're a voter you already know everything right do\nYou have to wear and and not only that but that information already public so what I you know we're not asking anything and all the public record in ... anyone would need to you know would would want to steal and nobody from Asia they will go down as private information\nAdmitted Sunday isn't it that people put their birthday and everything about them on Facebook and yet when it comes to getting their their birth date in their online voter to oh no you know kind of thing I think it's a funny [laughter] yeah\nWell you know my previous career as a journalist I was a big open this guy and so you know I I tend to say there's that I Would try to tell people that your name and date of birth and bought um those are not that the critical information that you need to protect so much as it is\nYou know your your Social Security number your driver's license number your banking information that's what we really need to protect\n[noise] yes what made you jump from journalists to the state election board PI oh\n[noise] well I wanted to you know I had a young family and I've been working nights cop should be a towards the end of my journals career and and you know I just wanted to a little bit more stable hours you might want to do something that I felt like we still\nYou know served a function of the garden ... as a as a journalist I did that because I I Believe strongly that that you know the fourth estate is important and that and that government accountable supporting wanted to continue to do something that I felt I was still on that same vein of\nOf uh being good for the country so to speak and so elections which is kind of a natural thing to go into it so I had a lot of back them covering that stuff and\nBrought up yeah you know it's it's been a good switch\nIt to grade one way and it's certainly helpful for people like me so um what are the stats so far how many people are responding early to that\nYeah so tell about thirty thousand people already who voted white male\nAnd that's actually really good that's more than we had him in all twice forty I'm forty years ago so we have over what we have from twenty fourteen and those numbers will continue to go up to actually get a lot of those out here in the last week so\nUm yeah walk she see those numbers go up and and we should uh that's another indicator\nThat that hopefully we'll get a good turnout this year or more turnout ... was not spectacular and we're really hoping we see a lot more folks come out to the polls this year\nThe turnout when wasn't good did you say\nTwenty fourteen four years ago the last election we fly care apples to apples hearts presidential years always typically have higher turnout that guy in the ... year yeah so we try to keep those those comparisons him until forty years ago we we had about forty percent turnout which\nWould like to be much closer towards ... percent for gubernatorial election and so you know we'll see some better turnout this year\nWell as you probably remember 'cause I have you on my speed dial that generally I call you right before the election and then you go of course we had early voting and I go oh boy I forgot to tell people about that so let's get into the early voting all the different ways people can vote early\n[laughter] right so right now you know that we have a vote by mail I vote by mail Paul you're more secretary he's by mail from multiple can office do you think it's a very convenient way to vote and going and mentioned on our website and questioned the ballot it's less than five minutes\nUm they will generally get it out you next day next business day we'll get it out to you in the mail and I think you've got children have to have that with turrets by election day to your county election where he's got a ... they've got to cut them arrive at the election board via let you have counted\nSo um but the deadline to request an absentee ballot is a Wednesday October thirty first Halloween day to day that the deadline for request naps valid\nAnd uh uh I didn't I I Would not wait until the last two that's that's the last minute on but that gives you know you'd have to try to get it get you and then you get it back to the character lecture\nSo I can go on line on Halloween day and request an absentee ballot and I would get it before the election and have to return it back to you before the election\nYes it needs to get around to ... electric courts so that's that's the key thing so you want to say that as soon as possible don't get out quickly but no I Can't I Can't do anything to speed the mail for some reason I got the way that's why you have to wait till the very last minute but\nUm you can request it up and up until that this ... pm on on October first deadline\nAnd it's not the state election board but it's the county election board\nCorrect you send your your your your absentee ballot back to the town will let you warned that of course there's there there are groups there's unveiling all looked at\n... on their\nWell that's pretty nice obviously I've never absentee vote it up with now I voted early I'm which I'm going to let you talk about in just a minute where do we find all this information online\nAt all I Would buy elections dot okay dot go there is right there on the page to apply for about ... and he had a question about ... voted you can look at it a drop down menu for voter info and go to the absentee voting and it'll be all the information ...\nPublic college by ...\nUh you know when the passport um ... any any of those things will work out on the second way you could probably identity is the free voter id issued every voter when they got ... votes\nUm you should get paid the ... and it's a it's just a little hard and that that will suffice for id\nAnd if you have lateral does occur the ideas by totally out of that David\nWhere the identity and as long as that information batches you have\nNo record say you cast provisional ballot and a half as long as you you put on there if you put your name correctly and birth and everything that she has a look at it and ... percent of those provisional ballots cast a lack of really ready to get cat\nSo when they catch all windy account early\nAnd absentee ballots\nEarly and absentee ballots generally won't be the first results all the lectures gay I'm In the mail ballots that those are are are\nIn those counties have until the largest cave action started a couple of days ahead of time\nA profit who knows and getting getting them count at the skeleton Shane just like um yeah they do polling place they have a machine at a scan all those doubts through ... and then when the polls close seven pm on election day they can take the the ... machine\nAnd they can plug in and I applaud those results for early voting for a\n... and ... typically you'll see that start putting in with the first half hour or so and those will be the first results election day sometimes there's a law that day and they made me a little delayed but um but when you first start to see\nThe okay ten seconds much time do you think will know who the new governor is [noise]\nWell I've heard of ... has a close you know the last ... brain banging

department I Know you're aware of the big push this going on right now about\nFlu shots and a it's a wonderful thing that people are responding so well this year my guest is of their Nazi and he is an epidemiologist at the Oklahoma City county health department so it was air thank you for joining me on a Sunday night oh good to be here to tell me what your responsibilities are at city county\nThough centrally like I said I'm an epidemiologist which is for those who are not aware I'm it's actually a disease detective and so I conduct day to day infectious disease investigation of state notify what conditions\nI'm I've so essentially any kind of communicable disease where whether it'd be um H. T. V. I got to be tied to the virus food borne illnesses\nOr ... or respiratory illnesses such as we now uh are protests just whooping cough I conduct those case investigations on a day to day basis and our goal is to investigate infectious diseases and prevent them from spring to others and locate the source to in order to prevent outbreak from occurring\nNow this is Sharon yeah this will sound really a simple but how do you investigate a disease\nWill will do what we typically occurs is that we receive an electronic lab report it from a provider someone will go to the doctor's office know get some sort of test done whether it be a blood test or a stool sample\nAnd if it's on a list of state notify what conditions by statute were required\nTo reach out to the individual the doctor's office provides their contact information and we'll give them the ... century routine call\nAnd ask them some questions about what symptoms they've experienced when they're ill or fear still ill and possible exposures before they got six we can get to the bottom of it so essentially a detective but in terms of infectious diseases\nYou know I'm I Know they were going to talk about the flu and um yeah I was reading this thing I think from the CDC and it was talking about how children younger than five need to get flu shots and a because it's so serious but this year aren't more people getting flu shots\n[noise] we're certainly seeing that we're certainly seeing a heightened interest and receiving the flu shot this year\nWe tribute that to increased effort from the CDC from the state health departments from various health agencies from the Oklahoma City county health department and we really tried to push very hard this year in early on in the year are don't let the flu bug\nYou campaign yet when you've\nAdministered more flu shots already\nThan we did all of last season which is pretty incredible if you think about it there's a lot of heightened interest is you're most likely which you that to how severe last year's flu season the ... the CDC estimated approximately a thousand individual United States died of the flu last year\nWith nearly three hundred a pediatric that occurring as well which is every ... bathroom flu is a tragedy around eighty percent of those were not vaccinated with the flu shot\nAnd so we've seen a really high interest our clinics lines have been you know pretty long every week more and more people are coming in to obtain their flu shot\nWhich were really happy to see that and we see an increased interest around the area as well close clinics pharmacies at University of Oklahoma David minister thousands of flu shots already their populations we're really proud of our progress so far so early before we really getting into the season\nNow do you mean do you how science center or the main campus\nHow both campuses that oh you health services at the Norman campus I Believe the first or second week of October of\nOctober they administer to thousands shocked when they report on their social media and of course all your health science center as well as in you know strangely shots\nAnd then the state department of health has also been in this during flu shot a free of charge that as well as the Oklahoma City county health department in Britain in a string flu shots free of charge the population which has been a really get written center is really no excuses here to come out and get your flu shot well\nAnd this is how this whole thing happened ... Johnson and I are friends and I love to do topics from the city county health department I noticed that there was going to be a drive by a flu shot free flu shot clinic we can bring everybody in the car and get your shots\nBut it was going to be November thirds I thought boy I better get on this and then because\nOf the popularity of the flu shots I wasn't I'm answering the question the question is why have you moved from November third to now December eighth", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Gwinn F Lippert", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "29"}
