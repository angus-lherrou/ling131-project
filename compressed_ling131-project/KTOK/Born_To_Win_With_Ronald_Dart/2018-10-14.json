technician in the DC area make over sixty thousand dollars a year\nVisit trades and while dot com or call eight eight eight\nThe following program does not necessarily reflect the opinions and viewpoint of this death and management of this station [noise]\nRonald Eldar am\nMorning to win\nI'm puzzled about something and I'd like to talk it through with you\nWhy is it that some Christian folks become involved in mysticism\nIt's utterly foreign to me but it has a very strong appeal to others [noise]\nIt seems to be based on the idea that there is knowledge that is only available to a few initiated ones that you just can't get to it unless you're one of those who have been initiated now here's my question is all the information that is important\nAvailable to all people is it ... or is it limited to a chosen few that is is it esoteric\nJesus does seem to suggest that there is esoteric knowledge he'd just given the long parable of the store and the seed to the crowd and he went back with his disciples and they came to him and they said lord why do you speak to the crowds and parables\nIn Jesus answered and sad because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given\nSo I Would conclude from this that there is such a thing as inside knowledge there are mysteries and it's not given to everyone to understand them but then the obvious question comes why not\nWhat's interesting about this is if you stay with Jesus in this in this discussion he begins to explain it he goes on for who ever has to him she'll be given and he will have more abundance but whoever has not\nFrom ... should be taken away even what he has as comes right on the heels of the statement is given to you to know to them it's not given it would be a mistake here to overlook who Jesus is talking about\nIt was in fact the Jewish religious establishment that he was talking about so what does he mean whoever has has fought whoever has not what is it they don't have a link goes on [noise]\nHe says for that reason I speak to them in parables because seeing they see not hearing they hear no neither do they understand\nAnd in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah who said by hearing usual here\nAnd show not understand seeing you show see and not proceed now from what I read here I don't get the impression that Jesus or Isaiah is talking about something that is not there to be seen\nPeople actually see it they just don't perceive that they don't grasp what it is that is right in front of their nose they here and they don't grasp it why\nWould he goes on quitting Isaiah this people's heart is waxed fact\nTheir ears are do of hearing their eyes they have closed blessed at any time they should see with their eyes here with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted\nAnd I should healed them\nThey just it's almost it's irony I think the way he's developing this latter part of this he says they have closed their eyes lest they shouldn't be healed it's striking to me though that he says their eyes they have closed it is it the God close their eyes they did\nNow does that suggest why they could see something and not perceive it or hear something and just not get it\nIt you know it is possible for people to lose the ... to sometimes for a lot of complicated reasons reasons of their own but Jesus comes back to his disciples and you said but\nBless it are your eyes for they see your ears for they hear for rarely I tell you many profits and righteous men have desire to see the things which you see and haven't seen them and to hear the things which you have heard\nAnd haven't heard them\nAnd here's the nexus of the revealing things that had been hidden from everybody it was the words and the acts of Jesus that they were seeing and they were hearing\nMen of old did not see these things at all they weren't there for them to see now they are there for anyone to see\nAnd still men don't see them you see we're not really talking about esoteric knowledge it was right there in front of everyone for them to see\nBut they had long since close their eyes and their ears to God\nIn fact the story of the parable of the silver is something I thinking person ought to tumbled to fairly quickly it'd be interesting to kind of take the story out of its context read it to someone and say what does it mean I think most English classes would figure it out very quickly\nIt's obvious what Jesus Smith so we aren't really dealing with anything mysterious unless you have blind in yourself to it by your prejudices or perhaps by your desire to justify yourself\nBut there are still some puzzling passages in the Bible and Jesus words about this kind of thing [noise] take for example John six for forty three [noise]\nJesus therefore answered and said to them Dole murmur amongst yourselves no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him now if you take that at face value value it means are all sorts of here's a great mass\nOf people out here and God reaches down and fingers a set of them and draws them to Christ and leaves the rest of them on the outside\nLooking in well maybe you know man can come\nTo me said he said except the father which sent me draw him and I would raise them up at the last day it is written into profits and listen down to watch written into profits and they shall be\nAll taught of God not some all\nEvery man therefore who has heard and has learned of the father\nComes to me now\nIn a way this is a difficult passive but there's one shining the light in it those Jews who had heard and learned of the father word would they do that\nWell from the Old Testament they read the scriptures they believed the scriptures they naturally gravitated to Jesus unless\nBecause they wanted to justify themselves a less because they were grinding some sort of political acts they hid ended up blinding themselves to Jesus and to Jesus' message and work\nThose who had learn nothing from God tended to naturally hate him because he threatened to the status quo\nWe're all comfortable where all settled down we're enjoying life the status quo is here's someone comes along and tells us hate this picture is all wrong\nWe don't like him so in a way this whole idea is suggestive of the good soil of the parable of this or and see which one we started with Harris Jesus explanation of the parable that follows on the heels of it he said here therefore the parable of sore\nWhen anyone hears the word of the kingdom and doesn't understand it
