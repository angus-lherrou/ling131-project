week in two thousand seven comedian and actor drew Carey taste silver hosting duties and the prices right the longest running daytime game show and television history carry replace Bob Barker retired at age eighty three after hosting the show for thirty five years that's your look back at this week in history\nThe following program does not necessarily reflect the opinions of viewpoint of his death and management of this station [noise]\nThe c._e._o. networks is pleased to present\nRonald Eldar and born to women\nWhat'd you make a treaty with the devil so silly question is that he would never do anything like that that would be stupid and yet nations do it all the time\nI was struck recently I've been rereading Winston Churchill's the gathering storm it's his history of World War two where he talked about all the things that led up to and resulted in the second World War\nAnd I was struck and how much the nation's risk on treaties that they trusted to prevent another terrible World War\nChurchill\nIn his book said that there has never been a war in history more preventable\nThen the second World War and when you understand the destruction of life property\nEconomic I mean it's just incredible to think about it and to think that no more in history was more preventable that that war actually could have been stopped some people can be accused of making hunt using hindsight and making a statement like that but\nChurchill saw it coming he said so to a new one that would listen and for him it wasn't a hindsight he knew it\nThe league of nations was a great covenant of nations banded together to try to prevent ever again having to fight a war\nLike the great first world war\nThey relied on a series of treaties and agreements you know there were\nTreaties and sub treaties that were agreements in some agreements all to limit arms prohibit aggression they specified how many battleships you can have one size battleships they could be whether they can be an air force how big an army Germany to can have whether Germany could have conscripts or not it would have had more treaties just a whole long line of of agreements and\nTreaties in some of these treaties and with Hitler in particular they made a pact with the devil now we would argue\nThat no one would ever knowingly make a deal with the devil because he is a known liar he is a sworn adversary the\nOnly reason he would ever make a deal with you is to do harm you wouldn't believe in you know he is your enemy no way\nIs only treaty which you would be to gain an advantage over you to low you into making a mistake and to eventually\nDo you in the parallels between what I just said and the deals that were ... with Hitler who was in human form a devil\nIt's it's hard to miss so why did the great powers do it it it isn't that it was all that they should have been completely blinded to it they should have known what they were dealing with what were the things that drove the great powers to make such a terrible mistake\nWe know why Germany agreed to the armistice treaty they wanted to avoid the kind of destruction that event eventually came down around their ears at the end\nOf World War two they were going down but why did the allies\nAgree to the armistice they did it in the fighting and to stop the bleeding and I use the term bleeding literally\nBetween two nations alone Britain and France they suffered eight million casualties which over two million were dead\nAnd these were the flower of their youth young men watch Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen twenty up to the twenty five maybe some of the officers on a toward dirty and these were the flower of their youth two million did and six million\nMore wounded Germany\nAustria Hungary in Russia suffered nearly Thirteen million casualties which over four and a half million of them were\nKilled\nAll the great powers including the United states suffered twenty five million casualties nearly seven million dead and that doesn't include the losses that were by the rest of the world\nEven Japan had two hundred and fifty people killed in World War\nOne so\nThey entered into treaties with Germany they created the league of nations and they held their breath men like Winston Churchill sadly only a few men like him recognized the danger\nWouldn't want to listen to them why did they continue to trust treaties with\nThe devil for the simplest of reasons\nThey weren't tired they were born down by war and they were deathly afraid of another war\nTheir economies ran a shambles they had lost millions of their best young men they wanted peace at almost any price and so they grasp but the tenders of peace\nAnd hoped for the best they got the worst and they got it because they\nAren't willing to pay the price of peace I why am I telling you all this\nI'm telling you all just to underline what fools we can be even at the highest levels of government\nAnd to consider what you and I can learn from their experiences because while we would never make an outright deal with the devil we're all too willing to make compromises with him and for the same reasons that Britain and France made a deal with Hitler\nAired we are afraid and we don't want to have to pay the cost of continuing liberty\nI think it's fair to say that sometimes we find ourselves worn down by the world you know Jesus did not tell us it was going to be a bed of roses he said you'll find as Matthew chapter seven verse Thirteen\nEnter in at the straight the narrow gate for wide is the gate broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there'll be that go that way\nNow that's not hard to figure is it you know it's just not as though the easy then there's nothing to it he says it's narrow you may not find that if you're going to be careful straight as the gate narrow is the way that leads to live in a few there'll be that find it then he says this and it seems to be germane\nMe aware of false profits who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are raving rules\nNow you would never cut a deal with the devil but you might well make a deal with one of his minions\nAnd not even realize it Peter in his\nHis all second a pistol actually chapter to talks about these false profits that Jesus was talking about and he he draws an interesting distinction is worth you and I give me some thought to\nHe said there were false profits also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you\nWho ... bringing damned ... Harris sees even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction now did you notice this that he makes a little shift in terms here between false profits\nAnd the Old Testament and falls teachers in the new it isn't exactly these false profits are coming in on telling us some prophecy for the future that's falls\nWhat they are teaching is not true\nAnd they're bringing in ... Harris He's not ... bad word but in Greek it really isn't that big a deal all it means is sect\nThey're bringing ... sectarianism even denying the lord that bought them and bring up on themselves swift destruction and many ... followed their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth she'll be evil spoken of\nSo we got to consider this not just a handful of people but a whole bunch of people are going to be following after false teachers who have privately or alongside a brought in these ideas\nAnd ... got a following for themselves and he didn't says through ... bay with faint words make merchandise of you whose judgment now all of a long time lingers nod", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Born To Win With Ronald Dart", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "21"}
