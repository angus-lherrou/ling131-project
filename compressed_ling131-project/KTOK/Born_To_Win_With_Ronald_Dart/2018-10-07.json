NATO Connor written up a\nPhoto of Pope John Paul the second on Saturday Night live as a protest over sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church the incident happened as she made ended her live performance and out of nowhere produced a photograph of Pope John Paul the second which he then ripped into pieces there were done silence in the Saturday Night live studio at NBC as they went to commercial\nAnd this week in the year two thousand the new theory CSI crime scene investigation they used on CBS with who are you by the who has a theme song [noise]\nThree more theories and the franchise would appear with theme songs by that I don't think my favorite was CSI Miami\nWith David Caruso saying TD lines like this ever saw it looks like\n\nThere's or look back at\nRonald el dark\nI've been fascinated for a long time about the efforts many Christians have made to sort out who they are politically\nFor the longest time they were nobody then came Jerry Falwell and the moral majority in politics hasn't recovered from that yet now we have a Christian right in a Christian left in this country and I don't know about that\nAnd see parents they made a very strong case to Christians should not allow themselves to be marginalized and then disturb some people who would rather keep Christianity separated into the private Smith sphere of life and out of the public eye\nBut now that Christians have awaken from their long sleep and considered that perhaps their faith\nOught to inform the way they vote\nThere are counter voices being raised for one thing most churches in ministries are recognized as a non profit corporations by the Internal Revenue service\nTherefore churches are not supposed to support this or that candidate nor any ballot issue for that matter and that raises the interesting question that well is it okay for us to preach that abortion is wrong\nNow these are the rules we run into and we have to play by these rules but we also have every right to discuss principles\nIn church in print\nOr on the air\nIt remains to be seen how long it will be allowed for churches to condemn immoral behavior hate speech that expression is the ... of the political left these days the constitution of course protects speech\nLogically it should even protect hate speech it's bad it shouldn't take place but do we have freedom of speech or not\nThe first amendment to the constitution says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise their of or a bridging the freedom of speech or the press\n\nNow what are we supposed to make of this because what we're starting to run into as it is in Congress who is passing these laws but the courts who are making the laws that somehow a bridge our constitutional rights to say whatever we please [noise]\nOf course I understand that whenever you are accepting five oh one C. three status which means you're a non profit and the tax deduction for contributions that you accept certain limitations because the public should not be supporting\nVet or this or that candidate at least in theory but I don't know how in the world anybody's ever going to make that work\nSo despite of all this weird do Christians fit in the political spectrum are they more conservative and liberal or more liberals and conservatives are they more socialist than nationalist\nRichard Newhouse wrote a column not long ago in a journal called first things and it clarify for me at least one issue\nHe cited Eugene Carson Blake who was in his day a major spokesman for the old line Protestant establishment Blakey said was complaining one day about the lack of compassion among conservatives who wind about high taxes\nI loved to pay taxes he said taxes are the way we help government to help people I Wish I could pay twice as much an income tax as I Do [laughter] I read that I gave that it I thought is Newhouse quoting him correctly and I have too much respect for him to think he wasn't\nWell new house being very much the junior this gentleman's hesitated and suggested that well the treasury would gladly accept his check for the extra money he wanted to give the government\nAlthough that he responded dismissive Lee would be quixotic in a just society I Would be required to pay higher taxes\nNo I'll confess I'm Still trying to work that out but when I read this I suddenly came to understand something that had escaped to me before\nThere is a marked difference between a just society and they compassionate\nOne\nLake seemed fine with giving more money as long as everyone is required to\nDo so but of course\nOurs is not a just society because some people are required to give more\nThan others certainly\nThe rich are required to give more money into the system then the poor are so does that make us an unjust society\nNow you hear a lot of talk in some circles about what's called social justice it is in effect another ship all that's on the left\nNew house went on to say the notion that liberals are caring and compassionate while conservatives are selfish and hard hearted is still being pedaled long afterwards sell by date\nFor instance today hardly passes that one does not read an article about the need for evangelical Protestants or Catholics to close the gap between the conservative pro life cause and the liberal social justice agenda\nNow I hadn't really clear before this the distinction between compassion\nAnd social justice\nYou remember when George Bush first ran for president he ran on a ticket labeled compassionate conservatism\nThe left hated him for that before they hated him on the Iraq War and justice including social justice by the way is blind compassion is not just\nJust wants to treat everyone the same now that's the meaning behind justice being blind and you've probably seen these great statues and Madame justice was scales in her hand being out there equal in a blindfold on so that she's not taking into consideration who this person is who is coming for justice\nCompassion looks at people justice wants to treat everybody the same compassion does not compassion recognizes the difference between need and no need\nSocial justice treats people as members of a class\nCompassion treats them as persons now when we began to understand is perhaps we can sit back put our feet up and think for a while about just what kind of a society do we want and what kind of a person and I\nKnew I really want to treat people as members of a class\nOr would I rather than a treat them as persons social justice relies on government compassion relies on people\nBut you see the government is not a person it is a system it cannot feel therefore it cannot have compassion compassion is\nAbsolutely impossible for a government or a state it is a human emotion and the government is not human no matter how many humans are involved in the administration of it\nIn the absence of compassion for the government can only coerce behavior", "show_name": "Born To Win With Ronald Dart", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "07"}
