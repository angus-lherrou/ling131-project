{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "[noise]\nThe [noise]\nMoney [noise]\nRadio [noise]\nNow back to more seed money radio with your host Larry Colton\nWelcome back I'm Derek ... your host of safe money radio [noise] I'm a save money retirement specialist working with science right here and the Oklahoma City area\nSo here's a question I'd like to ask how much of your money is currently in the market and all of it fifty percent eighty percent [noise] did you make a conscious decision to have that\nParticular percentage exposed market risk or did it did it just sort of a happen\nWhy am I asking well as I've said before the markets go up and as we all know they come back down how much of your life savings that is exposed to market risk is a very important consideration and that's why I strongly encourage everyone to think of their money in terms of red money and green money\nThose terms might sound funny but but I think they'll help but help us understand a very important concept so let me explain red money is money that we're willing to expose to market risk in hopes of a higher return\nWe accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater gains red money has exposed the upside and downside market risk with green money were not willing to accept the risk of loss\nSo we're willing to accept a lower return and exchange green money does not have downside market risk\nSo Fred money's exposed the upside and downside market risk and green money has only upside market potential which one is better well uh-huh that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad at it all depends\nThey're very important question we should ask ourselves or these what percentage of my money should be in red money and what percentage of my money should be an agreement [noise]\nIf you're at or near retirement you should ask yourself if any of your money should be in red money I mean can you afford to lose any of your retirement funds\nWould you rather take two steps forward and three steps back or just take one step at a time and never take a step back\nWell that's what we do here and save money and if you'd like to learn how to step forward and never backward call for our safe money book and information get that could change your financial life for the better again our number is eight seven seven five for eight safe that's eight seven seven\nFive for eight seven to three three there is no cost or obligation\nLet me tell you what red money is good for it's good for the young man is good for the rich the young have time on their side and can afford to lose money in hopes that don't make it back in the future they're rich can afford to lose at least some of their money and still live comfortably\nBut if you're at or near retirement you should definitely be in the grain which is money that cannot be lost due to market declines many people believe that all retirement money should be green money personally um I think that makes a lot of sense\nDepending of course on on your situation but many people I work with regardless of age what a hundred percent green money because they know they can have upside market participation with out except in any downside market risk\nIsn't the time for you to go green with your retirement [noise] give me a call at eight seven seven five for eight safe eight seven seven five for eight seven to three three and a will show you how that's not not only can you have some upside growth linked to markets without any downside market risk\nBut you

seven seven five for eight seven to three three and we'll arrange to show you how it works now over the years what we've learned is that having green money provides an enormous benefit\n[noise] and that is a tremendous sense of comfort in relief for the person making the decision I think about that the worry the stress goes away just think if you have read many losses and get upset probably the money should not have been in red money\n[noise] so this makes it easy to decide you ask yourself this question if I were to lose some most or all of the money in this account would I be upset\nIf the answer is yes then your money should be in a green money account\nYou may be asking yourself what green money options are there other than cash\nA check in her savings account and bank CDs\nThat's

degree or the garden party on one thousand KKK\nAnd Jamie should we be worried about our plants this week\nYes I Am so glad you said that God loves the not so glad you're glad I'm going to take all my plants\nThere if I tried something that you know that's that's easier and um it's failed\nI'll step up to a chemical but um that's the reason why you're washing it off really well and if you if you wanted to do something as a prophylactic like just in case something came up you could uh you could use a\nSpray with horticultural oil or you could er and would you spray you if you got like a gallon of water and put a couple of drops of dishwashing motion in it\nThat's like ... one of those are like a dishwasher yeah but the problems here print out ... here but I used to have a green print on ... or this is a parolee spin but at the uh the one that doesn't have a ... because that can be hard to plan but you can wash it it has a decrease\nYes no you don't mind degrees or because that's that's got a chemical burns the leaves okay to something like of death for work\nAnd um and then if\nYou later on in the season if you noticed that you're getting some insects on there you can put Nemo oil which is completely non toxic you know you could spread directly in your mouth if you want it to [laughter]\nAnd and if you accidently over I'd ever really ... over water the plants are while they're sort of go dormant which\nIs very easy to do a lot of times you'll get fungal mats and if you will just go to the store maybe by him now\nBecause they might not have them in the winter but a mosquito dunks just break them up and put him in the soil nugget that will get rid of the uh the moment\nThat sounds good [laughter] horticultural oil is that the same dorm at oil\nYes a dorm and all of the type of horticulture oil but you know it's going to be inside your house I don't get to use a heavy heavy oil that's usually for trees outside when it's cold\nSo if you want to use a light horticulture oil or if you just want to do that um that water and soap thing that would work to an end name is considered horticultural will also\nOkay All right well I appreciate it and I'll tell you\nI've thank you so much you have to get back on him up I you know that's\nA lot of work it is and I always makes less minute every single year a hug were caught us all by surprise right right and you know a lot of these plants will ... it can get\nCold for second it can dip down and I have a little bit of a nip without hurting your plants so if you don't want to bring all your plants in right now I Would just bring in the super tropical is like I Would bring in a bringing you can do is I Begin a pipe viscous um I Would\nBring in anything that you would see\nOn vacation in Costa Rica what about a mother in law ...\nMood last stuck it actually ... it could take a little bit of a cold it would probably be All right but you definitely need to bring it in before the the true for us which is usually\nRead [laughter] yeah I you know I got to thinking about this memory used to always gas when do you think the first frost would be and ... what would we wouldn't really gas like October fifteenth or something like that or do you remember when my over Fifteen\nThat I don't know it was we we usually say November November fifteenth or something by the I mean I mean they've they've kind of backed off this morning but a Thursday night friday night they were saying\nThirty degrees for the city at the airport for Monday when they went back to their morning yeah well they also do wind chill [noise] you know and all those millions you know no no no no Mike Morgan's big board on when he was going out three days out he had it at thirty three really\nYeah but they backed off today I saw they were like same about thirty six for that for the for the weekend so\nThat might be closer to get at the airport\nThat means Shawnee Jeffery crescent Piedmont\nAnd everybody gets through because no three or four degrees below yeah what the city gets in you know as far as saying earlier it's going to be kind of touch and go about whether or not we can actually wish thirty two are not viscerally\nBecause I mean the city we have all this concrete it warms up during the day so it it definitely uh\nYou know to flex some of that cold away from it and I mean if it just gets down to like thirty two for a couple of hours that usually okay I Would still bring the super tropical and yes but um but you know if you have like a let's say like a bus\nEarn it could it could probably take a little a little bit of that as long as it goes back up a sustained through two degrees but you're looking at that bringing them in and also plants are wet can handle coal better plants that are dry yeah\n... that's what I remember my mother doing rider and water water wind we've had so much rain that I think everything's going to be is going to be able to take a lot more cold temperatures and if we're coming into this from a drought so what is it going to do to the fall foliage around the talent and drive this is going to be one of the\nBest years for fall foliage in like probably like ten years in someone would you go see it though I'm I think it was but what ... what you want for fall foliage as you want to slow cooled down and plenty of moisture and so I'm thinking\nI can run Halloween I mean a summit ... needs to have a pretty hard knock a cold temperature to actually color up I mean there I Know some of my plans or ... or the yellow ones are starting to get a little bit of yellow on them but ah I bet you like and maybe like\n... the weekend the first weekend of November it'd be a nice time first weekend of November yeah okay [noise] um\nOh ... okay [noise] hello Judy
