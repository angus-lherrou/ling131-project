I'm going to\n... to ... and say uh if you're in love with the red maple it's a great choice and I think either one of them or do I like um\nA debris anyone for me a little dark I I I sort of like the other one okay but I ... I was just going to give you a three other maples just to check out and see other smaller they and they do really well here and uh probably the one that can be the most\nWell there's going to be locked really color but ah one that has a ... I'll start with one of the yellow when there's a yellow one called an amber maple\nAnd it's a ... you are\nAnd it's that's a search and all ah by the way I'm really happy that you use Latin with me that's just like the best way [laughter] [noise] so uh it's we had that it's a really it's a parking lot trees or anything that can grow in one of those little wells the parking lot or is this going to see protests\nAnd uh it's it's a very very small so a great for a small what he means there's it gets about ... it's ... it's it's about the same size as a red but\nMaybe we'll smaller than a red button so ah and that's that's about ... well I think of a small tree I think I read that too so maybe like Fifteen feet twenty feet [noise]\nAnd then um then the second one is a ... ton maple\nWhich is ... or ... or caught him and it's because it looks like the bottom of the leaf has been cut off or ... and it has beautiful a yellow orange red coloring and it's nice it's a super tough a\nSmall tree and it's it's really nice and then the last one is a little bit harder to grow but it is actually a sugar maple which is the most brilliant novel maples not sugar maples don't grow in Oklahoma except\nFor during the ice age all the trees are came down and then when the then when the uh the glaciers retreated back apparently a sugar maple was left in Oklahoma it's evolved due to adapt to our climate\nAnd it was found in in a in the canyons in Quetta county so this is a this is like a living fossil [laughter] now it's going to it you'll have to protect it a little bit from um the southwest\nSon have used that one but that is it's it's and it's also very slow growing but it's it's sort of like bragging rights\nOn that one out of thoughts\nOn that one with the um [noise] a couple of south\nSoutheast of that's not that's not bad for the cat um but uh it's going to be a little bit hard to find I think that the only place I Know Web is sunshine nursery in Clinton, Oklahoma which is a ... it's ... forty but I mean quite a ways I think it's an hour and a half yeah maybe about an hour and what\nWe love going to places as well so I don't mind going anywhere [laughter] well you should go see that nursery\nDead nurseries amazing really ... the one that uh runs it and he was on the USDA like small tree large shrub ah advisory board and he travels all over China looking for plants and Asia\nOK okay I'll put a note on my new calendar\nGood are you a ... that's also good time to plant potatoes\nYeah yeah I usually do then [noise]\nAh now my other question is I have a lot of the things coming up\nThe car and stuff that the squirrels are planted and that is\nAnd I cut them off and usually hit him with concentrated round up anything else I can\n[noise] not really you could uh 'cause the but the nuts they're going to germinate any way or you can put a pre emergent out but very pass the time for ...\nI don't I don't have a roof are pretty American\nOkay yeah ... you know what I Do is I uh\nWhen I when I cut them off especially if there's little seedlings are usually um scream with anything they usually just die on their own because I've got a guy for for because now there's other things that will come back but I I for pecan old country so I Know exactly I feel your pain I Know exactly what you're going through but I Do but\nHere in the lawn you know your mall the mall and\nRight yeah it doesn't matter but ah\nBut yeah I Would just uh if you if you can't pull him just a a cut them off and then you know you don't uh you don't need a spray the big large area there's that little ring on the inside of it\nI just I just spray the little stump\n... or ... or do you want it to you could do a um like a sponge brush and just dad 'cause it's just that ring that a little green ring in there that you have to hit\nYeah well I just uh I put some of the concentrated round up in a a like a spray bottle left from counter strike\nEar or something in the kitchen mhm
