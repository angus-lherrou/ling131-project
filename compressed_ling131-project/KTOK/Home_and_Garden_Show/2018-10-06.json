{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "What is the purpose of money\nIt is very simple yet profound\nIf you understand what I'm about to explain you can live out your retirement with less stress and more comfort than you ever thought possible there are actually two purposes for money only to know more and no is the first purpose is life and the second purpose is that\nI bet you've never heard that before I'm sure everyone you've listened to or taken advice from has always tried to tell you about growing your money but it's never told you about the purpose of money so what does that mean a purpose for life or for that\nWhen I say that one purpose for money is life I mean that you are going to use the money while you are alive in our business we call that income duck right with income no matter how you look at it if you spend the money while you're alive\nYou're taking income from that money for the purpose of life\nWhen I say that another purpose for money is death that means that you are going to use the money once you are dead or you're not actually going to use it but we call that legacy in other words you are going to pass the money on to your heirs\nAfter you're gone now it's critical your financial planner understands the importance of creating strategies for both the purpose of life and death\nSome strategies work better for income and others worked better\nFor legacy but the ideal strategy allows you to maximize your income while protecting your legacy just in case you don't live as long as you hope to that is why you should call me now at eight seven seven five for eight safe\nThat's eight seven seven five for eight seven to three three\nI Am an expert at no market risk strategies that will provide you the maximum benefit for life or death\nYou can call now or any day of the week for my three hundred and Fifteen page save money book and save money kit that's a hundred and Fifteen pages of everything your broker does not want you to know call eight seven seven five for eight safe or\nIf you're spelling challenged that's hate seven seven five for eight seven to three three so like I said there are only two purposes for money spending the money while you are alive or leaving the money to those left behind\nBy far the most significant purpose of money is into it is one thing to not leave your beneficiaries any money when you were gone\nBut it is a disaster if you outlive your money\nIn fact studies show that outliving retirement income is feared more than that or public speaking not the purpose of your money is income\nThere are only two plans for that purpose one is called applying for death\nAnd the other a plan for life and if you have a broker or financial planner that isn't an expert and plans for life\nI'm certain Huron applying for up what is a plan for death when it comes to retirement income well here it is you save up your money and invest it and something to provide a hypothetical non guaranteed rate of return\nOr a short term guaranteed ready to return in other words you have no guaranteed for long term growth you might hope\nFor seven percent compound growth but after fees and market crashes and rate aspirations and so forth you have no idea what kind of return you're going to get in fact\nYou don't know if you're going to get any return because the next two thousand eight might be right around the corner you save up your money hoping it grows\nAnd then at the point you decided to retire you start drawing income from your house how much do you draw for present three percent five percent or do you just drop out them out you need and hope for the best the problem with this plan is that your hypothetical growth\nIs combined with an arbitrary spend out of your retirement accounts you have no idea if the plan is going to work\nBecause you don't know how long you're going to live\nIf you die sooner than you thought you spent too little\nAnd if you live longer than you thought you will probably run out of money before you die in order for this plan to have any chance of success you need to plan on dying by by a certain age that's why we call it a plan for death do you want to plan on dying by a certain age\nDo you want to plan on dying or plan on living in a second I'm going to tell you about applying for life\nAnd if you want to find out specifically how will know market risk plan for life would apply to your retirement call me now and I can show you a better way to live away towards a lifetime income account that isn't wasted away by fees that comes with up front bonuses of up to ten percent\nWhich will never show any market losses no matter how the market falls and provides you applying for a living as long as possible call now or any day

out or is that having that type compact yes they have such kinetic energy to them\nAnd actually none of it's wired I I just I'd be added in there and they're yeah I Do and I just I don't I don't like\nWiring stuff but uh it takes too long but you if you want to do that is if you want to do the home you can just use something anything for base so I use this to a recent mom had as my base but you could get go get a um grape vine wreath mhm uh\nI've even made by on like a reef base a base is out of ... oh and yeah or any type of bond is like flexible and you can just just wrap it in on itself and then you start putting stuff in there\nTo enter a national competition [laughter]\n[noise] you know if a week goes by that I don't say that [laughter] [noise] I Am at the end of time I'm\n... I'm going to enter it next year next year just that county ... state fair because I thought I thought you told me I had to win at the county free fair before I could go to the letter I thought that

all the Dolby things in there that will actually fade or like I don't know how long that the ... we'd go last and\nI had some some of the furniture there there's going to drive all the quick and the media plant will probably drive all the quick\nBut ah I'm just going to start pulling it out and then putting other stuff in there and it's just ... it was like during the break was like I don't make a list so I'm hoping to be really easy to get is magnolia leaves oh yeah or see parts on the big noise a really pretty gifts\nAnd an ornamental grass seed heads yes goldenrod blooming right now and if you get it early enough it it drives perfectly\nEnded a coral berries or like I always say it's like the berries homely sister but ... later on I can use it in the winter\nOr the color guard ... use of use those blades in Florence which before but uh if you wait until it gets a little bit cold alternative like a pink color over the yellow and green do look pretty and then you know what you could ...\nYou could actually but secular what's in there if you want it to lose now how would you put the second month and you\nJust a a an urge them if they're if they're going to be cold hardy um you just take them out the pot and then you could just wrap it up with a little bit of um like most of the Muslim one or you could wrap it up it's like ... or just yeah just so that it's all a and just poke 'em in ...\n[noise] well uh I had wanted to ask you about what I posted I have a Facebook friend Johnson Graham Bridgewater and he had that incredible picture of the Asia the attic milkweed did you see that's the Harry Potter and the and those are the good ones right\nThe other and they're they're African but there are they are ... there's some controversy about him and uh [noise]\nWhat's the controversy [noise] they they were worried that there is they are African skis me yeah I bet that that they thought there might be might that live on them but that doesn't apply to us because it's only when they're three years old and they they die here in the winter so we don't have to worry about that\nThe ...\nAnd ... did you happen to see a Mike Morgan had the uh it looked like the cold front coming in and it was actually the monarch butterflies really on their radar wow that is sales it was incredible that's right we're going to take a break and we will be back here\nTo have our too

STAR One\nThousand you've got one more clues [noise] Ah yes it is spread by ... fry zone okay you're listening to what the\nNews radio one thousand Katie okay am gay X Y fmri Ninety six boys want\n\nWaiting a final vote I'm Pam who sales Fox News and just a few hours the Senate is expected to confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to be the next Supreme Court justice Fox is Jared how far is live on Capitol Hill who has the votes but opponents of Brett Kavanaugh are not letting up [laughter]\nPlanted lights a carries is called sterile ... giant [laughter]\nTo Roy it'll just avoid you know for some reason I Would strike me as ... giant but I Am okay\nIs what this royal ... know this this is just the species but makes me think maybe I Need to go get steroid giant because these leaves will be even bigger\nOh wow and how how big do you think that leaf is they leave is twelve inches at least across I think it's bigger than like Eighteen Inches although I was going to be like twenty four oh it might be yeah\nBut my shoes about let me take my shoes off now which is about\nI guess [laughter] but I'm Glad it's radio ah [laughter]\nOh actually you know what I totally forgot this did you know I guess your foot length of your risk to your other okay the set so there's that yes I'd say I had seen inches do as it's\nIt's it's turning my feet so I think it's three for ... twenty four meals and it's funny\nUh huh and that's not even the biggest\nOne that is he's in Egypt [laughter] of course that is the first thing I did when I cut when the leaves of my first grid is that I actually like I told some of the advantages a giants fan [laughter] I can feel the air and so this is growing gigantic ... like this in\nYour yard yes yes and it's spreading and spreading but the problem with is is it's really hard to transplant if you can only transplanted went just first comes up on the ground in the spring\nAnd I don't know that I've ever seen that I Would think it would be any illegal plant no no good because it because it's invasive\nDebate on giant ... has this giant and weird [laughter] don't you think it's kind of we are the ... it's it's it looks like something that could that you can't eat it yeah yeah well you know it's kind of ... salad saying\nNo no no doubt poisonous but there's there's not I I\nI looked it up and they they don't have any medicinal value for it or anything but um well I guess and given that the clue yeah I'm ... and if you know what this plant is er ... I mean if it's in one of the things that you're thinking that might be it and disclose will give it away\nAnd the office of the stem is used to make paper a\nHandsets why it's from Asia Asia giant leaf Asia\nPlant you some paper making for pay per yeah let me see what they do they'll get a\nLot I don't know if it's right or not because I don't know [laughter] let's say an on air I don't know if this is right\nWho\nOne giant leap for mankind [laughter] large leaf plant on Amazon dot\nCom oh ha\nEight four oh one thousand STAR One thousand if you want to try to guess\nYeah I just saw it ah the only people I Know that know about it are basically master gardeners but um\nYou know ... it's ... I didn't realize that can grow in the sun because I just grew into shape it a little rice and got out into the sun and getting even bigger than the sun but one of the nice things about having large foliage\nA plants in the shade is that you're not going to get a lot of color in the shade and like you wouldn't have full sun fight so if you will get you a lot of least texture\nAnd or had like big leaves in the little tiny leaves and everything that that's something to give a diversity in the shade\nRight is this related to a plant that we've just made a medical plant no no I'm not going to make a ... that's what made me think okay let's see if Sean Sean do you have any idea what this plant is\nWell I was calling because I have known that a way to about twelve inches a\nWow God so we're lucky\nOh I like Chris ... believe it or not I ... I wouldn't go to Wal Mart climate\nUh-huh so they went to I don't know that the that and they're pretty\nWell so wherever you're going around a whole bunch of one\nOh yeah oh my gosh\nI cover I call balance stores on this the first time I ... well I called our doors on cars on lucrative warm over there or\nThat other plane or yeah we're not going to say when a a well\nOkay [laughter] or a ... that and I was like well why he said because they're sterile\nOr what I Do not going to blame but no they won't accept that I've never seen anything that could\nStart from the kind that you could just what you were talking about or what do you have to wait 'til they start climbing up in spite of the car and you have a careful when we go I was helping one\nWe'll go to the My Lai than I Do need a new sudden find nuns and I was like well we're not talking about the ... when I was like well why\nDon't [laughter] say\nNo and actually there they are from there from China and\nThe counties have yeah I never even got yeah\nSo but I haven't done that that's not that they're not related\nThis giant leaf saying no this is something from like a a Taiwanese forest hits in Dimock to Taiwan that widely coughing in East Asia and you know I didn't uh as far as your puny if it's a\nIf it if it's producing seeds that's viable then um it's it's not a hybrid so or to use the get go\nAccording to our stores are on I I'm not aware because the ... for when I was a girl my uncle my great uncle group\nWhen when you look back yard and pretty much just does not fit mhm so I told him I said well if I could\nStart from\nA ... right right oh\nWe'll go ... ... ... on the faces or you're not ...\nWell but what happens is if they if they cross two different species a lot of times the the plant will be sterile like ... you know and the way that they increase the plant is they do it by cutting for\nBut those plants locked him says those are going to be great plans because they're not going to exceed posit that means that they're going to blue more\nBecause they are putting their their energy into flowering and knocked into making seeds but obviously you got you got something that is viable so it might be a species or might be it's a variety that's been around so long that eventually mother nature's made it or not sterile anymore [noise]\nSo you're going to harm anyone I Know it's ... it's not impossible yeah aren't you know this is Shaun [laughter]\nWell I'm One of the books were what color the boys are going to be who yeah I Know you go to cross pollinated close I mean I'm I'm a nurse every partner but I'm also a farm girl though\nYou know a little bit you know because it's hard because my mother in law said well I have known as I chopped them down because of all the all along with what you\nKnow that's an Atlanta bother anybody saying pretty yes ...\n... ... or or what causes oh\nYeah well I ...
