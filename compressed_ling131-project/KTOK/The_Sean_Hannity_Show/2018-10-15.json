really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact when and\nWhen I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about that in the news they say that we had hurricane that were far worse than when we just sat with Michael ... says that they say they say that and I wonder if I'm a scientist and say it's worse than ever\nA show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda us like camp during them to just also have a political agenda\nWhere was that angle of the the altered climate change data it's science was as the Al Gore and

started listening and he heard that he's about to lose his mind or am I why do I know and the president was down visiting the devastation left by Michael ... hurricane you call that a thousand percent

two years Greenland has had\nNear record snow fall and the reason why the north Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold\nPeriods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties\nAnd nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process for the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal still fall and near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking high about five six years ago\nThen they came down below and they're back you know normal now let me let me say this is the president answer the question perfectly here's why up until now\nClimate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her question is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now or\nYou know whether they ever anybody else better than anyone else I mean okay but when you look back at the earth temperature as it go out and cooler and then warmer in the warmer than cooler\nIt has so questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that's why now let me let me give Leslie for if if she lets thing if you're listening motive for examples intensified more rapidly than Michael right off the top of my head\nNineteen thirty five hurricane went from a tropical storm to a category five and thirty six hours hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine\nCame a lemon days across the Atlantic is a tropical wave\nForty eight hours later a category five

happen how to ... its way out of my classes at Penn State Nineteen Seventy in the Nineteen seventies\nOr whatever I mean I don't know why Hillary so define on the issue but she is um so we got the ... let me tell you what's gonna happen though one twenty two days because I think this is important we have a CBS News battleground poll showing that the house races are in a statistical tie\nMy advice to you is to think three weeks from tomorrow you're going to turn on the TV and get bad news because maybe that will motivate you and the agenda simple impeach investigate open borders eliminate ice they want their crumbs back they won Obamacare what else do you really need to know\nAnyway they find that the battleground states the race for control of the houses now within the margin of error which means a statistical tie\nThe same CBS survey finds that for Democrats to when they have to rely on voters who say that they're going to vote this year but did not turn out in the twenty ten or twenty fourteen midterms\nIf the elections are held today Democrats would stand to win two hundred and twenty six seats they claim more than a two hundred and Eighteen needed for the majority

finally taken a lead there I've got to believe that her leads going to get bigger once it begins to resonate what a cinema has been saying about people in our own state whenever she travels abroad I if you look at some of these other you know districts it's very very tight\nI honestly can't tell you what's gonna happen in twenty six states like a twenty to twenty two days I Can't tell you\nBut I Will tell you got to personalize this election I mean Nancy Pelosi look at her is that who you're voting for voting for a Democrat that say if you vote for senator that's a Democrat you're voting for Chuck Schumer\nAnd there are radical left agenda you know if you if you want to know what it's between lower taxes less\nGovernment intervention you know there's a fascinating piece on the Drudge

America\nWell guess what that that one thousand foreigners nine taxpayers pay more taxes than the bottom Seventy million\nAmericans the top three this according latest information coming from a Bloomberg and it's a year twenty sixteen but individual taxes are paid by thinking about this the top three percent pay the majority of everything\nThe top one percent paid a greater share of

jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThat was a great piece by Jonathan Turley the three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and

information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton they paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we are finally beginning to get to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us\nFormer congressman now on Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of digital ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as\nThey seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk\nIn front of them under oath well the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on force that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the OJ won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\n... the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is mark Elias market why it was ...\nHe was ... for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that the ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and can get away with that make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threaten to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nIt's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you were talking to your former French and telling them to get them to uh get him in to the Congress to take this that and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoena first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh my God he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and you said peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it they say that I I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss that Mr Elias Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has it and ... issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or\nAm I sick and the G H cue\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was in fact conversations George ... were intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation\nThey found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary's emails or anything else and they never gave information to the fight the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand\nWhat the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all um and by the way even\nHer lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there is no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media league strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that the CIA information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump\nCollusion but they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relief of his duties but just before I'm Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid about what\nAnd then if we get some somebody without ... started to get in the Justice Department they can do a criminal investigation\nThere's also a criminal and civil litigation it's possible for example Carter Page said discovery in a case that Carter Page could bring would open up all kinds of information about what what\nHow long would that discovery take 'cause I Know Carter Page is moving forward with a lawsuit\n[noise] well it it just depends on the ... where you where you're filed a case where there is a slow docket or rocket rocket docket but none of this could have done Sean without that can push the\nCooperation of the media without those journalistic with David Corn and Mike is it cost cutting out the information just regurgitate in the information that they receive from uh the people who were doing this behind the scenes\nI I Can't believe that there's not enough outrage to realize what is actually going on here\nIs you have a dicey a series of reports put together known as the dusty by Christopher Steele\nThat's Hillary Clinton DNC funneled money through a law firm ... hiring fusion GPS and research firm then they hire Christopher Steele and they put together unverified uncorroborated in mostly now what turns out to be debunked information Joe diGenova\nFirst they use it to hurt Donald Trump and the general election you know the stories about you know Russian hookers\nUrinating into bad in a in a mosque out rich Carlton for example that's all being leaked even by high members within our intelligence community for the purposes of influence in the election with a with a series of lies and propaganda\nThen the same information is used again to create a special counsel and to really deal legitimize and hopefully dismantled the presidency of Donald Trump that's when it came down to\nWell there's no doubt about it a a Sean that that as Victoria and I have been saying now for Eighteen months there was a brace a plot\nOf brazen plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton illegally and that if she lost the election to frame Donald Trump and that is exactly what they did these people were motivated by an animal is\nCalled Donald Trump which led them to fabricate evidence to use foreign intelligence services fabricate evidence wiretapping medically ... and and when they found exculpatory evidence for example\nThat would have favorite George Papadopoulos they hit it from the by the court there is no doubt\nThat number people like John granted James Clapper on down all the way into the White House committed crimes and that Jeff Sessions\nAnd Rod Rosenstein cannot figure out a way to do this and by the way John Huber ... Utah at the head fake\nDoing nothing six months without report I've let the Brady Bunch of indictments tomorrow useless if there's an outrage which out I should have been both inside of tolerated I Know the president's waited till after the election to get rid of them and I say to hell with both of them All right\nThank you what's going to happen Jason ... you see a new attorney general down their own\nNot filling it up I just put up a piece that I wrote about sessions can't go soon enough worthless use their name only the really should be is that a second special counsel to look into Brandon and all these cast of characters we've been talking about over the last few minutes they did the president needs that employees\nWell their hair president making that decision himself\nYeah absolutely you could push that for a ... and and releasing the documents to Congress absolutely\nYeah I think all of that needs to happen or orange twenty two days before the election we'll see what goes on from here a thank you all for being with us eight hundred ... all one Sean toll free telephone number what happened to the Washington Post reporter uh Jamal should cause showed the um\nAccusations that the Saudi crown prince is involved in the murder of this journalist will get into that also have the latest on the rioting that took place over the weekend both in Portland in New York City and much much more as we continue busy Newsday here on the Sean Hannity show only twenty two days till election day [noise]\n\n\nGrabs your costume and enjoy a junior leaders Norman ... run on October twenty first pet ... learn more and register now it looks dot com backslash junior league he'll be Norman\nSpend an evening with four remarkable American heroes the Patriot tour comes to Oklahoma City Thursday October Eighteen join Marcus Luttrell\nRetired Navy SEAL and author of lone survivor tae a Kyle ... author and widow of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle retired Navy SEAL and endurance athletes David ... and retired army captain Chad Fleming but it's emotional uplifting live event the patriots or October Eighteenth as civic center Music Hall ticketed patriot to her dot com\nHouses gay\n\nThis is what's right with America you're listening to the Sean Hannity show\nChallenger of sunlight and got on the phone and asked the friends [noise] what can I ask\nThey deny it they denied every way you can imagine in the not too distant future I think we'll know an answer\nWhat are your options left home they did what are your options would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators proposed\nWhat depends on what the sanctions and give you an example they order a military weapons\nEverybody in the world wanted that order Russian wanted it China wanted we want it if we got it and we got all of it every that if it's on what you've got that on our parent when I don't want to do [noise] going like Cain Raphael and all these ... I don't want to\nHurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that and you know there are other ways of a\nLot of teams a word that's a pretty harsh orphanage true\nPower everybody what to think here [noise] you know there's a lot\nOf ... there's a lot of sick and [noise] maybe especially so because this man was a reporter to something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really\nTerrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to see what's going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nBy the way the president on sixty minutes last night talking about the mysterious this appearance\nOf this reporter Jamal ... uh we have some new updates for you on it it looks like the Saudis are preparing to admit that he was killed in an interrogation gone wrong I'll get to that in a second we do have other breaking news\nUh twenty five now till the top of the hour we're glad you're with us\nIt looks like in Maine the Bangor police department along with the fire department and the local hazmat crew are on site it's Susan Collins is Maine home investigating a suspicious package\nThe state's criminal investigation division is also assisting at the ongoing probe and reports of the alleged threat came after Cohen's ah of course\nGave a key vote as it relates to confirming justice cabin on to the U.S Supreme Court prior to the voter office was they luge with threats against the senator and our staff\nIn one case the person didn't leave a name a number they threatened to literally rape one of my young female staffers ... quoted in the wall Street Journal\nLast weekend Collins returned to Maine after having all was sworn into office and address the media regarding her decision and she told reporters the supplemental FBI report that she pushed for\nWas a turning point that help to reach the decision to support cabin on despite\nThe accusations that were leveled against him she actually gave due process um I've had this happen to me white powder sense of my office one side and assistant that spend\nWhat the the varying rest of the day in a panic state in isolation because of this white powder you know these things that people do and in some cases it's actually real as in the anthrax case\nUh one other news about this more news on the Senate before we get to the issue of cars shaggy a in Georgia you know those blue waves as a midterm election is apparently according to a Georgia gubernatorial candidate saying well that's going to include illegal aliens\nBut the thing of it is the blue wave is African American as white it's Latino it's Asian Pacific Islander is disabled it's differently abled it's L. V. I. L. J. B. T. Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are\nThe candidates said and then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who were told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nSo I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp telling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia\nAnd said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in the gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Christian a cinema now she's going up against Martha ... one of the important racist that we're following and how she uh had referred to her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and\nAll the Washington Examiner apparently found the emails that show cinema herself inviting a prominent group I'm not making this up of I'm reading from the Washington Examiner of feminist which is in Arizona called pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's day and the protest the war\nAnd I mean this is an enormous enormous step back on\nYou know there there there's no covering this up if they have to admit that they did this ... and the details of this come out there is a risk because we think there's going to be some explaining to do I just encourage everybody to keep\nThe whole global picture in mind here uh when doing it we can't start World War three over this although sub there has to be a some form of a upcoming clean by the Saudis some form of a of retribution there's no\nDoubt that they want to have sit on the people in the conflict and I don't believe for a second that they didn't know\nOr at least the crown prince did no sooner than this uh All right thank you

maybe on the heels of nobody in the Democratic party condemning what happened up Pam Bondi here's the Nielsen the secretary of homeland security or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant or Mitch McConnell at an airport\nYou know it's just play a little bit of uh some of the marching orders\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for

you know some banana republic where people are out there killing each other on the streets everyday\nI invited on somebody that I disagree with strongly politically but I think makes a good point and condemns all of this with me\nOr Sally cone she's a a super hard left wing or ... you don't mind me saying so the all through the book the opposite of hate and the host of a state of resistance a podcast\nOr do you tell people to follow a Pam\nBondi and and Sarah Sanders family and and secretary Nielsen into restaurants and getting their faces and confront them and great a crowd and push back and you does that advice you give people\nSo you know Sean this is one where I first\nOf all Hi nice to hear your voice and\nThis is Kelly hates when she had surgery with me she's going to now like\nI'm not I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you the answer because\nUh when I was an American either you know before you and I met I was a community organizer I used to organize protests like see I'm going to\nPeople's workplaces or you know not just the whole the Congress right which are that's where the people's business is supposedly done but we're talking\nPeople's lawns cetera um you know look I support in a free speech absolutist I support free speech on all sides so am I and the and these protests those sorts of protest now make me uncomfortable and look I did speak out against\nA you know going to you know in a costing people in restaurants or you know what happened to stare at how these centers et cetera I Do think you are\nI I Love you sent your cause you're kind of ignoring you know I I don't know what I'd like to punch I'd like to punch him in the face or not the crap out of them or you know maybe they should have been rough up or you know that that if we can talk about violent rhetoric and we're gonna look I think it's all bad\nBut like ...\nRhetoric is now the tactic I or go to the heart of the hard left you know people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their pony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech and my hearing you write you used to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correct yes why would you do that\nKnowing that there could be kids women and children in the house because I kind of a rule leave the women and children alone\nWell I I I haven't met maybe maybe you'll today that that kind of I don't know maybe it'll be accused of being\nSome of those policymakers might be winning the lead the husbands children alone to where the partners whatever again I'm not saying it a ... or some kind of bragging rights I'm saying it because I\nThey should on that has changed\nBut won't hire hearing now regularly issued these sounds to me like marching orders creator crowd push back follow them into gas stations department stores restaurants you see a cabinet member you go at him getting their face\nI'm not here in the Republican side and my point to you is this look I think it's very hard to try I I ... I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line and um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all but I think we've gotten to the point where we're gonna have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now ... get to walk the halls\nWithout what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations own and I met her\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and by the way all within the last ...\nYeah but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is his rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now I always said about\nObama that number one leave his kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did and I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents and I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear what\nI don't need to but what I Would love you to play it again look first of all you're ignoring them of nonviolent protest the phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all you're if you're going to be ignoring examples of Donald Trump early\nWhen people were stood up for him saying I've got to hurt and if you know I'll get you in court don't worry about it and you talk marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing has happened no nothing so sort of like well what I was saying oh no no no no if you want me to another question I didn't take that as is the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing\nThat is now happening with the Democratic party and by the way I have the evidence of me saying about Obama\nOnly play I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile I\nMiss the speakers you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah You're welcome\nSally called ...\n... ... here's what I think we agree on violence is that I Hope we both agree that the thing I Will and I am actually and written about it or you know Hillary Clinton's comments Eric Holder's using comment I spoken out about them and it gets out there is also a very very visible pattern\nCohn at ... at ... at a Donald Trump I'll beat the crap that part of the problem is nobody wants to hurt you want it anymore and the good old days the rest of them I treat them very very rough\nFirst of all fair about both sides in the Senate and come to this past weekend where you had to
