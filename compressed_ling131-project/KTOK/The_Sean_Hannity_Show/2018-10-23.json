um\nBut he was never Trump her now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on it alone that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\n[laughter] ... that's personal but you know the fact is the never Trump\nOr his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support on the Republican Party goes up or I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um [noise]\nI don't know anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and on killing two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know there it by foot they make it in what\nThree weeks three and a half weeks but one thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and I don't ... and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight as soon as this this was you know you aren't going to choose I said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because he he I mean yeah I talk to them at a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning says it hit me this morning if if the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices they can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks them from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them and northern Mexico like if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be that Mexico this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they were turned back the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them in Sydney college done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend this decision as to say I deemed this to be unacceptable for national security reasons and that blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're gonna have to step in here somehow turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is I Know by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do it we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nIn my fear is if they get to the border that we could\nBe a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for that if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nRight but but we remember in the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best foot plan for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans ended up with their own political reasons doing nothing\nThey decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhat they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact creator effect human wall and block people from entering the United states\nNow and I'm actually going to have

five 'til the top of the hour we've asked to Newt Gingrich to stay with us I Want you to really go into a longer explanation us said Kavanaugh caravan are going to be the defining issues in the next fourteen days people will vote fourteen days from now\nI Would add to that caravan Kavanaugh\nThe mobs we now you saw it happen to Kevin McCarthy is house it through a Boulder through the window I'm at so they did to Henry Kissinger you saw what they did the Mitch McConnell this is just in the last two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like\nWhat has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing leap claiming credit for it yesterday if they want the success to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choices election but I I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decisions\n[noise] well I think that's right um and I think that that in a sense\nOf the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left that you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to total cherry an attitude a that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said they're willing to use force a former attorney general saying when Republicans go low kick them or you have various democratic leaders saying it's OK to harass people uh and drive them out of public life ah you know and remember that Maxine Waters is not a trivial person she would share\nFinance banking and financial services committee if they get control of the house\nShow of the significant people are saying these things are building on on a sense of a rage in a sense of the illegitimacy of of the modern American government which left passionately believes a I think that you're right that that's a factor\nThe reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment\nIs these aren't historical events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't just politics it was historic we're we're going to get\nA solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be mayor and parents were assassinated and lied and manipulated and browbeat and into backing down so that was that was a historic moment do have an effect so the next forty or fifty years\nA similarly this caravan whether it's seven thousand people or the Mexican newspapers right and it showed up to fourteen thousand\nIf this caravan can get into the United states how big is the next caravan and the shower then after that I mean it's not like it's a one time event here the entire world is watching to see whether or not we have the guts to protect the United states of America from an invasion\nOr and if we don't trust me it will be a lot of people willing to come\nWell I think I Know exactly where they're going to head to straight to California the sanctuary stayed and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as is offering to provide for them that's

fact imposed on the federal government activities which you cannot possibly in post and at some point we're going to have a big collusion with ... century stage ... or a fundamental violation of the constitution\nWell I think that this is I I Do agree with you um I\nHave a pretty good feeling about the Senate I think that\nThe way events in our in the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift for certainly the cabin okay you know it's amazing to watch how the you know the other news channels are covering the president's speech last night\nOr the ... they're actually fake news CNN actually says president lies tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never covered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery stores follow them into department stores gas stations and you tell them they're not want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders a Ted Cruz and now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker\nNor can I say or or elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering that will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they are running on\nNo I Know guys I well they do run on a government

pastor I Will say this pastor ... you've been very good to me and you even said to me he prayed for me\nAnd I I I Am I'm very touch when people say that to me and I know you mean you're a good guy\nAnd and David has written these books she started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen pole and the early church\nAnd David is that a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything um I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but um but I Believe all of us and uh and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot

seller list welcome to you too David said a pastor Scott and Kareem\nThank you hey how are you guys thanks for having me on what eight let's start with this mob everywhere we see we're not going to kick our ... I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington ... during the Kavanaugh hearings said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in and I said center Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation\nIf he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with um I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out of the ... ballot box I\nHave a fear and when I say feel with him we got him myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I'm asked myself what I had to wait another man of the ... that's why I say I have a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me would come out and then if I'm with my wife told me would come out\nAnd then it will go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets that's exactly well\nMaybe but you know I listened I train five days a week an hour and a half maybe the martial arts and they know this well it's ... it's not going to stop crazy people but\nI got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk away I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect it we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're\nGoing to react like that's just not then they're going to get pissed and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nThink the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarded as but others say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of them nonsense seems to be coming from the left and the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am ... so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald\nTrump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back\nWhile the predator didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never\nDone better thank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up\nAnd you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating at twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent Kareem tell him as a message has been moving the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor it would do it with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this was a charade here the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics of CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the all the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or education from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people\nAnd that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we have an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the leftist authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white or read that book is a racist sexist massage in this Tacoma ... Lama foe but they weren't dirty air water they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\nBut that also they also hold eyes kept him out yeah and then one of the polar ice cap to melt\nI'm Simon ... and I'm a product designer after I learned how important brushing your teeth is overall health I worked with a dentist Tibet sort of a toothbrush and makes brushing most simple affordable and surprisingly enjoyable quip sensitive stomach vibrations that a gentle on your gums and built in ... that turn that toothbrush that makes brushing most simple affordable and surprisingly enjoyable\nQuip sensitive suddenly vibrations that a gentle on your gums and built out job [noise]\nYour\nFinal moments and final thoughts here from pastor Darrell Scott also agreements with it what is you have a last name right cream live near near okay and David Limbaugh or David will give you thirty seconds final last word thoughts today what's gonna happen to fourteen days\nI actually think that we stay off the um the so called blue blue way that we might even retain the house and we're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close but we don't want to ask me to keep it and I think as the pastor Scott ... said\nWell there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including a black\nAnd I'm telling you liberals can't stand this Kanye and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's uplifting we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last two week\nHow how great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country\nHas a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they could afford to vacations take the kids the does anyone there seven and be miserable uh but but they want to take their kids go out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things but it's it's this is universal listed humanity\nYes it is I really believe you next fourteen days are going to be critical for messaging as long as messaging stays consistent also I think that you know there's a script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against the shell prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation\nI'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party shares\nRight good to see a both ... and we got to let you go to thank you so much for being with us pastor always go to see and when you were in New York my pre shit you being here David as always congrats another New York times best seller it's on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com\nUh when we come back a tight race for congressman Ted Budd we'll check in with him than your calls eight hundred diaper one Sean is our number of an awesome Hannity tonight at nine hope you'll join us as we continue [noise]\n\n\nThis report is Roger you buy true car [noise]\nFrom the CBD plus usa total traffic's Judy organ southbound thirty five in southeast forty fourth and southeast fifty nine very slow their\nReputable I spent forty four western North West highway one Seventy third it may North West twenty third mate or one thirty eight to ten western north of I'm forty four wrapping up north was one sixty force in Portland wrote game total traveling\nLooking to buy a car online shopping can be confusing not anymore what drew price from true car now you can do the exact price you pay for the call you want and see what other people pay for it too when you're ready to buy a new a used car is a true card to enjoy your more confident car buying experience\nExperience I'm Wondering excitement as Oklahoma City ballet present Alice in wonderland fall down the rabbit hole into the fantasy classic finally with Carol now is that team members choreography ... musical scoring bringing allies end of the twenty first century within the national costume dance theater anti deterring\nDumb at that well how did he ballets incredible ...
