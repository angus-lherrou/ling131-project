targeted by by all of this but other postings\nYou know um if you look at a that\nThey don't seem to express admiration for Trump's politics so you got the other side of this you know crediting Trump on the one hand with strategies with helping him open up a sports bar know why he would put that up there in any way that seems a little odd and weird and\nUh but I think what we're dealing with somebody with a great instability\nIs one is from MSNBC is Andrea Mitchell a promise to repay your door apply to your threats\nYou know we will answering coming to see you soon and uh with his arrest by the way it means one lunatic one maniac is off the streets thank\nGod and um\nWe uh we have to just credit law enforcement for the good work that they do and it's amazing the DNA trail led to this Florida Man\nAt his fingerprints on some of these bombs that basically they were small PVC bombs and from what we can determine they all had powder in them some type of electric some type of electrical connection device director re described it here's a little bit of what he had\nSay\nIn that effort in getting those devices to our lab from around the country [noise] we can confirm\nThat Thirteen IDs for sensitive areas individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe [noise]\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet and energy reaction to heat shock or friction [noise]\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices [noise] I Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the guy left [noise]\nBased on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters [noise]\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is at ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier rushed down in Florida [noise]\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and Ali would but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work [noise]\nI also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every\nDay to try to keep the American people safe from harm and who moved quickly and efficiently into action\nEvery single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now another packages on\n[noise] so we need the help\nEveryone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement

today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nOf protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from\nIraq to re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day you know the sad thing about all of this you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve Scully shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact that he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through at the time was far worse than was reported\nAnd uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders if you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and as it did they came up a number of times I've been a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us\nAs Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong\nFeelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile I and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot on fake news CNN is named my ... what's his name John Avalon somebody\nWho's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years and I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part of what needs but basically blaming me listen to this\nLike Sean Hannity says had a direct language ... may have we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage and being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the control projects here but here it's not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessings in Europe for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... Robert De Niro calling the president devil and us devil worshippers it affect you know\nI'm playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the ... see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the other campaigns bin ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's a he's a dog he's a big he's a con\nArtist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care fix these gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald\nTrump [noise]\nI'm On what are we talking about [noise] idiot as the president [noise]\nRight now they are offering a free Wall Street insider tips so you can get started right away colleagues see three Seventy trade\nYou'll get to on line classes instructional videos and the guy that will help you learn to build that second income it's all free\nCollie three three Seventy trade they will even throw into free tickets to an upcoming workshop so you can ask questions and learn more\nGolly three three Seventy T.
