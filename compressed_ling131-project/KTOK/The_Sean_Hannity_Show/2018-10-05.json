Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans pulled him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that's a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made to hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their\nTheir son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans ... ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was a poll that we did for a super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's it's not a ...\nExplosions but what it is is ... is coming back in and Galileo well ... ... that Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago but less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right

agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental\nUm to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is that I'm going to leave the house which right there you can lead to pick up the house and I think\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect narrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job and then you\nAre talking about Sean is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats are from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her I think of America I think it's going to tell a very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think it starts right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs it inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... and sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did and said this manhunt for support do you say more\nDisgusting and I don't believe who lie to you for experimenting Arlen than things\nThat do you what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process\nAnd for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not you proud of the how the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I went up I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal and philosophical differences with\nThe judge Kavanaugh I Would not be voted for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second um I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of archer just Sherry destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and there's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party\n[noise] um I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what\nDoug don't make the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Democrats put the late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to push for the drunk driving but they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape of that women are people people weren't right Jordan realize it was a choice between Hillary Clinton\nAnd Donald Trump and they voted for Donald Trump and and this voters in the heartland right now that are engaged we have to keep them engaged over the next four weeks because when we when again and cabinet gets confirmed they can take things are fine
