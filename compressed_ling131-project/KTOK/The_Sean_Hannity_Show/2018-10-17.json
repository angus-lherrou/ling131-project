... eight years without a single year three percent GDP Growth well I Hope you're going to support the for a million new jobs we've had since Trump selected eight million out of poverty and all of a food stamps and he's elected four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs the largest tax cut in history\nThe the greatest amount of deregulation we've ever seen in in five generations in this

don't say that you're gonna have a tear up against them they're never going to negotiate\nAnd the fear of the tariff has caused them all to negotiate I mean more jobs at home look at you know look at

search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe and took the show gave this appearance that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding

physician doctor Salah Mohammed al ... listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nAgain New York post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president hairdo on and the Turkish foreign minister after ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough

Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nYou have a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume if that watch exists in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish

signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's\nGoing on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it

already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered and we know he just show again never exited the consulate\nUm we do the

the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across this country doing better and that's what brings us to this election\nAnd I'm thinking I don't see any good ideas from

mainstream media is not reporting on the twenty fifth of July\nWhy the declaration of a ceasefire and Europe was absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to\nGet pressure on China from Europe he's actively and people are really reporting this priest joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues and these trade agreements with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show ... and bite me back I think you get to trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took a thirty five percent dive\nSo that was made by now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nOh gosh yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and uh well we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs you're\nJust to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled\nUh it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it done shortly thereafter or because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very or\nA but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government\nAre and what is best for the American working family so\nAh and that's why it was all ... and by the way you know I was back at sky bridge Sean I'm doing a lot of traveling around the

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discuss\nAnd I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen either Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator\nHad been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri they're they're they're the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her some of these position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much have shown for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now exposed as something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda lie campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is a lie and to hide who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show no ah this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appeal to moderates as a front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats or a shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party abandon any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these anarchists middle class of vendors attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punched by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from kicking her campaigns on\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that's sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she said the number of quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of ... billion betting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will walk by what were courting the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own were their own their own or it's not\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers nixed a roast about how she's going to impeach Trump and she didn't tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's very words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out than before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates I have known you know what for a decade or more\n[laughter] that's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next to release the candidate of the time we have to United States senators\nAnd their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using the ... tactics against the landscapes the Lenski was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the

and then once they get elected to the new deal bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's it's just on videotapes not my words stopped my claims I'm not giving you
