{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "Earlier I told you that we had Lewis in Greg come into our office and as we sat down and and discussed with them the aspects of their financial plan their income plan\nOne of the aspects that we talked the most about was how much income do you think you're really going to need\nAnd and lowest felt like they needed for more than what Greg felt like so you know they need to come to an agreement there but what Victorian I discussed was look you've never been in retirement before so you're thinking you probably think a unique for more than what you really need sometimes people underestimate\nIn their case they were kind of overestimating\nAnd we said look before you start taking distributions you've got enough cash to live for a year taking here\nTake a year to try to figure out what your budget is going to be take it for a test drive and you should\nReally do this at least two years before you retire determine how much you think you're going to need to live on a retirement and then practice living on that amount for about six months\nIf you can't well then you know you need more so either lower your spending or maybe plan on a part time job but take it for a test drive try to live on that amount of money for six months and if it's more than you need well maybe that's a good problem to have\nThat means you can put more money into the plan let it grow and you don't need as much to live on particularly if you have a paid off mortgage mortgage is usually most people's biggest expense and retirement you still have one one now you've got you pay off the house you can inject that money back into the budget probably put it towards healthcare\nNumber two you need to adjust your spending plan after you take your test drive with your budget be brutally honest about what is in need and what is not\nMaybe you don't really watch enough cable TV to justify that bill it didn't take me to retirement to figure that out that's why I cut the cord we don't have cable\nWe have Internet three cable provider but we don't have cable t._v. anymore because I have three hundred channels and I watch maybe ten of them don't need all that\nSo now we have streaming services like Hulu and Netflix and slang and Amazon Prime and whereas I was spending two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars a month for television that I wasn't watching now spending about fifty major savings\nJust by cutting that and you know what I don't find that I really miss anything I mean I've replaced basically Ninety eight percent of the television that I watched if you'd like a little bit of a insight and tips on how I did that and what it's like and the different services that are available I'm having to sit down and talk with you\nI envy king a finance but I'm also the king of cutting the court and if you work for one of the cable companies out there I'm very sorry I don't mean to offend you but my job is to protect my clients' money and so that's what we're going to do on the show and part of that is saving money when you don't have to spend\nNumber three you want to check your emergency fund and your medical coverage you need to consider having Eighteen to twenty four months of cash\nIn the bank to cover non discretionary items also get estimates on Medicare premiums\nYour supplemental policies you long term care policies and then add those to the test budget to see okay well you know between Medicare premiums and supplemental policies and long term care policies all these things I mean you know we're looking at eight hundred dollars a month whatever that might be\nMaybe more you know call it Fifteen hundred dollars a month I don't know what it's going to be but added that to the budget to see if you can do it and you can't well then you know that there might be some gas may need to plan for that number four\nMaybe there should be number one but you didn't make sure that your spouse was on board retirement is a team sport doesn't\nHappen in a vacuum if you live alone okay that's different but if you're married and there's more than one person in this retirement game you need to make sure they're on board we will often ask spouses when we visit with them if\nThey're ready to retire one will emphatically say yes and\nWe have to say that's great but I was asking your your wife or your husband [laughter] and they're looking at is shaking their head and you know\nA lot of times guys it's it's your wives they want you to be happy they love you and they want you to retire they just don't want you to spend every waking moment with them at the house because you know when you when we get older as guys we we tend to annoy our wives\nI Know that what happened with my wife she would make me do something she she would make kick me out of the house somehow but\n[noise] you know that's ah that's one of the things you have to think about is your spouse on board with your retirement\nCommunication is key and finally number five you need to be sure that you're going to enjoy retirement retirement is not\nA a an obligation it is not a requirement it's something you should do because you want to do it\nWe don't know too many retired people who just want to sit inside all day to watch TV\nVery few people just want to travel all the time\nSo when you retired you need to make sure well before retirement that you haven't gotten your retirement\nHours and days and months and weeks in years filled with activities how are you going to replace\nThose activities in your work life you have power you had status and prestige you went to meetings you knew people you've chaired thing now you don't have that anymore what are you gonna do just sit and watch TV all day you just gonna travel all the time\nMaybe for the first year maybe you'll do that and just sleep in and you'll think wow this is great and then after that time you're like okay so what do I do with the next twenty nine years of my retirement you got to have a plan for what you're gonna do you need to be sure that you have a variety of activities and goals for retirement\nThat's volunteerism maybe you're going to start a business you're going to mentor you know you're going to help your church\nI don't know pick something you may find that retirement the idea of retirement is really just not for you Victoria says all the time on not ever going to retire I'll go do things that I Want to do but I'm never going to retire because she knows\nAnd I know and we've seen it over and over some times early retirement\nBefore you're really ready can lead to an early death because your spirit lax motivation and your spirit\nOkay your spirit your energy that's what drives you that's what gets you up every morning you gotta have something to look forward to so make sure that you're really ready to enjoy retirement and that you're not just doing it just because everybody else is doing it\nRetire when you're ready or not because some date on the calendar says so and we know that you're listening right now because you know the retiring well as an easy\nBut you're not quite sure where to turn to what to do and I'll be honest with you getting help with Social Security income planning managing your investments looking at taxes your state plan long term care\nWe do all those things and guess what a thousand other financial advisors in town do those things to they should that's what they do\nOkay you don't go to your doctor necessarily because they're really good at\nBeing a doctor there are a thousand other doctors who are good at being a doctor to why do you choose that doctor because of their personality maybe or because of great service whatever it might be for us why our clients choose us above others is not because of all of the the knowledge we have it's\nOf what they're not getting someone who's going to hold their hand and help them restore order so their lives because of retirement disrupt the natural order of your life you've never done it before so you need someone who has walked that walk with other people lots of other people and restore order to your life provide that safe harbor so that when things get a little rocky you can\nUnless you can come see us and we can say calm down it's all gonna be okay remember\nWe have this plan this ... this was expected and then you can breathe easy and you can live in peace that's what we do that's what we provide that\nYou don't really find too many other places so if you've saved at least five hundred thousand dollars for retirement and you were looking for that safe harbor you're looking for someone just look you in the eyes and say I can restore order for you\nAnd give us a call for all five

through the end of November So I Know how much you love the first person defender series where we take just regular people and throw them into situations that are\nAre they attacked or there's an attempt to kidnapping or a carjacking or an ATM robbery or whatever\nAnd we see what they do it's kind of interesting to see how they react because\nPeople think they know what they're going to do it well\nThey think they know what we're going to do and we kinda know what they're going to do and so as a result we set up the scenarios to fool them to trick them we offer diversions we give them red herrings if you will know that's not really the bad guy but you know the bad guy yes\nAnd then when it starts to shooting starts and it gets real interesting real fast a first person defender it's

I don't know I mean there may be a an existing list somewhere I just don't habits\nBut I'd love to get your first hand reports on museums you've been to that you thought were cool now one is just down where else just down the street but very local to us here in New Orleans area as World War two museums started as a DJ museum\nIncreased the Pacific and everything else it's now the world war two museum and it's world class definitely worth going to the water the museums you have been to\nWhere you found that they had an interesting collection of God's wouldn't necessarily have to be a fire on his museum a gun museum a place where you went and went to that that's a cool display\nUm you know there are a number of them around the country so I Would love to get your reports on that [noise] okay let me find the story because this was interesting to to to do this was when I make sure I start at the beginning\n[noise] what's new is old again we're told his new again the gun ban industry\nHas I Would say rediscovered but all they they just bring back the old stuff that never give up when you think oh yeah okay they're off that they're never off of banning anything\nThey just switched to the things that they think that can get at the moment well turns out for whatever reason it crushed me on this they coordinate their back to ammunition\nWhy would they do that well they're saying well you know we might not be able to ban guns but without ammunition to God's will be any good they won't be able to do anything okay\nYou know\nIf you do it you do that is the place you know get a motel for maybe three or four days to go through it properly\nWere you know they they don't sell a one day ticket to the buffalo bill center of the west museums you can only get a two day ticket because I think you're going to need at least that and\nThat was talking about this Cody Cody fires museum is only one fifth of the whole thing there but it's amazing isn't it\n[laughter] it's the only place I've been able to find everything from a tree in a trench percussion cat for a lady [laughter]\n[laughter] well your your your timing is perfect because in about oh ten minutes are actually

name of it is\nYes the show is called a master of arms\nAnd edit the weapon making competition show and on the show you've got late as gun and blacks\nThat you kind of show up and they have no idea what they're making that day and they could be a challenge to make a gun to make a buck oh or or a blade and it's really exciting I'm actually one of the judges on the show and they start all up and expert on the show and it premieres on November a second at ten pm\nThis is kind of like a cooking show with guns were the chefs show up and they don't know what they're going to make right\nYeah it's pretty much we've got three contestants every episode and they they come to our armor and they get a quick draw challenge and that is a challenge that they have to make in front of the judges and they've got anywhere between three and six hour depending on what the challenges\nI have to make a functional battle ready weapon by the end of that\nAnd after that round are leaks out ... each have their weapons out at the ultimately a deliberate eliminate one of the contestants and then the ... you can go into a math challenge or did they born a challenge so much bigger\nA more complicated weapon and they've got more days to make that in one of our workshop\nAt the end of the four days a three judge it ... I Am myself we go out and yell and meet up with our friends that ... or even the former special operations diaper and he asked the weapons out in the field and that we select one of those two people to be titled master of arms and they went ten thousand dollars\nWho give us an idea of I mean obviously they're not going to make like a full blown modern growing like out of a chunk of metal or they\nWell they they they depend on eleventh actually look at our weapons are historic so they said\nYeah you know completely for average day I still are played out or something even when you watch the trailer you'll notice we've all out so very odd drink but they do I mean they and the show they make a firearm\nA but then they make split lot fire with different types of combination weapon but uh sometimes they'll have the barrel the inside of the barrel gorgeous back a car into what they're making putting together juggling down I mean they are doing a lot of work on these weapons\nSounds like you've lined up some really a top level crafts men or are there any women ...\nThey're they're they're the one that on the show I'm\nThe guy that was pretty amazing got on the show it\nIt really impressive because I'm a total book and art and [laughter]\nAnd I one of the things I decided when I became I was that I wanted to know how\nThe fire for himself out the ... one of the ... that it's on how to shoot a historic and modern got as I've always kind of practical application\nTo my study of history but I had in that it can't really make a lot of early at the beginning of watching these ... men and if you modern and old techniques together is is pretty spectacular\nWell how did you how did you get involved in this thing in the workforce\nI I deal with profound neuropathy on my body is genetic condition I have the mile a nation of my nerves rehab I went to um [noise] a a natural path I Can't remember her name about\nSeven eight years ago and she said Adam what you eat can really affect how you feel and I at this point in my life about three days a week I Would be in so much pain that I could move I'd be curled up on my couch just like\nOh my gosh and\nShe said let's do an exclusion diet let's cut out everything out of your diet that could potentially affect you\nAnd we did and it was horrendous it was wasn't fun ... you're going to this diet and we started to add in selectively foods that were in my regular diet ... and what I found was this um soy products and shrimp\nWould affect me but not on the same day that I eat them\nOr delayed effect right so it would so if I ate\nShrimp today I Would be in movable blob the next day and I'm the same day the next day so talked about a blind spot I mean even if we're we try to be self aware about things you have how can you take into account stuff that you ate yesterday\nI called him cause and effect may not be an immediate thing I'm Sorry I'm\nSuddenly just the ... I I I I Am so fascinated by this because this has happened to me and I guarantee you every listener for some people are going oh really you're retired because of what you ate ... and other people are\n... this is a revelation I Would venture to guess most people who aren't regular listeners this is a revelation that the things that you ate can cause because you know for me uh\nWhen I was in high school ... pound through anything and not feel a bit of difference and so when I was in my late twenties and what I ate begin affecting how I felt\nI didn't know that there was a connection because I just thought hey I eat whatever I Want ... you know I never gain weight I always feel fine I don't get much sleep it who needs much sleep and then one day at all catches up\nBut those blind spots and ... you began the discussion with thoughts and emotions though\nAnd ah I gotta tell ya\nJosh and I were talking about this before the show a meeting with a group of\nGuys and uh it's it's like a Bible study type thing and I\nI don't know it's breathtaking sometimes whenever you talk to a to folks and you realize they're walking around with something called condemnation just a sense of constant\nCondemnation shame guilt even those who have already there couldn't unique hating with God right there in a relationship with God and yet they still feel condemned and their entire\nLife is upside down Josh where we're talking about that and it's a huge blind have no idea about the love the goodness the forgiveness the know condemnation life of God\nYou know the whole last the whole aspect of individuals that that walk around under that cloud and here's here's me I had an an an intoxicating amazing experience Adam had one as well when I was Nineteen years old\nThat gave me a revelation that there was someone completely\nOther worldly than me that wanted to be my best friend but you know I'm fifty nine now and I'm Still learning that God desires to be my best friend in ... around with me because all these constructs of the way we're raised the churches we attend the things the experiences in life\nUm they really take us down a road to where we are questioning can God really actually be good ... and back to Adams point I have learned in my you know later years in life I have to go back and actually ask\nWhat am I actually believing about you God\nAnd it's horrifying sometimes what I really find out that in the basement of my belief I think Jesus as my best friend and I think God it's a harsh taskmaster there just wants to whip me and beat me and it's like\nWell wait a minute Jesus Says if you've seen means you've seen the father oh what that was a big one for me about ten years ago it's like oh you mean exactly how Jesus was exactly how you are God\nBoy did that uncover all kinds of stuff in my life\nAnd that's the thing is that uh I I you know I Know that we're talking kind of deep in the in in the woods right now and talking about believers a lot and you might not be a believer I Want you to keep listening\nBecause when people when I was talking to this group of fellas and what I sensed Adam was just condemnation shame guilt\nI'm not feeling like they're ever getting over and\nUh their entire lives are being affected by this it's not just ... just the\nSpiritual area quote unquote every every relationship I have a relationship with severe\nIt is the foundation of were from out of which everything emanates if your heart is not clear and everything becomes cloudy but once once we have that perfect when once we've been\nResurrected in the power of what Jesus did our nature becomes new and fresh and then everything flows from a different place new creatures\nNew new creation is a it's a it's a thing and and this is the direction that I wanted to go for a second half of the show today I didn't know if we were going to go there or if I was going to plug in a replay of pasture\nSteve eaten a from grace church out in Choctaw are used to be the head of scope ministries I Know a Josh that you\nAre very familiar with that\nYou guys might need some help in this area maybe you want to head down to a for a place like grace church and chopped off or scope ministries here in Oklahoma City or a variety of other places but what you need to know is that there is now therefore know condemnation\nTo those who are in Christ Jesus I'm telling you his arms are wide open it's not this thing where it is harsh heavy\nGet ready for ras now it's get ready for love and radical acceptance and I'm Glad that you joined us today this is the kind of conversation that you think this is belong on a health show yeah because as Adam said everything emanates from\nUm [noise] it's just something you know how many things should you know before you do this and\nI had all of them and I guess that's because I Know all of them but they said no only for the five and one of them you didn't need to know type of question but I knew all five of 'em so I thought you needed all five of my mistake but the bottom line is is that\nJust materials are very very good now\nIf you're not going to take this material you should be taking some other kind of material I'm sitting up the night before I decided to take this with my fiance I decided to set up and listen to motivational speakers\nAnd I sat there for hours just listening to motivational speaker what you realize that you're listening this podcast right now I haven't listened anybody for years because I've had everything I've always wanted\nSo now these guys are telling me well Dell order you do it you're just sitting there I mean what does it mean to be a multimillionaire when you could be a mega mega multimillionaire and I don't really see the number the numbers the money as something I have to have\nI see it as a score card as what I'm doing what am I doing with my life and how much do I have to give back to society what do I have that I can go out there place into the world and make it operate do something with it she ought to hoard my money\nIf I go out to invest my money then I'm going out there and making something happened in the world for other people and I think that's an important point\nHowever that's not the point that I'm trying to get to today\nFor them trying to get to today is you're wasting your life away there's no way that there's only enough hours in the day\nTo go to work come home to eat\nAnd then to watch TV any amount of TV you're watching is almost guaranteed to be a complete waste of time news is a complete waste of time you

hours from five o'clock to ten o'clock before you go to bed maybe you go to bed earlier I don't go to bed until one or two o'clock usually but\nI'm I'm ... found that I'm not capable of learning past about nine nine thirty ten o'clock I started getting tired\nAnd the stuff doesn't go in as succinctly as it should\nBut think about how much warning you can accomplish and not only learning how much

enough time to get out there and make something happen for your family you are the one that's making that happen not someone else it's not real you're living a lie my friends\nI Know because I was living a lie but I was living it on purpose I was drinking 'cause I didn't really care\nWell stopping drinking only did one thing woke me up to [noise] what am I going to do now\nRight and I'm saying

some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One version and there's one way or the\nBack to do all the way to show that they were talking about what are you doing with your life right now I mean I'm\nYou know that the whole thing that should be here the last couple of days is that um about three weeks ago I stopped drinking or what the hospital for procedure came back out and now it's like man\nIf I don't drink or do I do I'll tell you what to do I get back on the horse and start thinking about life again because I was nothing myself out so I've been talking of first two segments about what are you doing to numb yourself out to come home at night and stopped caring about life\nPick those segments up if you just turn again go to um\nThe website and and get the podcast so I'm going to get off that topic to talk about another topic\nTo talk about what rich people do compared to poor and middle class people which are like I said the other day I was was his ... guy that anybody who is middle class is really poor because all they think about is just basically getting by what can I earn what could I have what could I drive well can I live in\nYou know what kind of close kind of work what kind of watch do I have kind of this is just me me me me me and I which is basically starvation mode you know what what do I have and talk about the the poor middle class and the poor would just forget about I mean they're just completely lost\nBut the middle class people think that there somewhere\nAnd their idea is save a little pile of money\nThat rich people don't think about save a little pile of money rich people think completely differently than than poor and middle class people [noise]\nMiddle class people think about saving they think about\nStructuring their consumption to be below what their income is wealthy people don't necessarily waste don't get me wrong many of them are frugal also but they don't focus on structuring\nTheir life to live below their means they focus their life on creating more income enrich said for dad cows Psaki said it pretty interested in the well you said my poor dad\nOr see how did he say to go see if I get this correct quote here or at least close enough that resemble his statement but he says his um his his poor dad would say we can't afford that\nAnd his rich dad would say what do we need to do so that we can afford that that's a pretty clear explanation of the two different types of thinking and so wealthy people we go you know what I like the tech our life up another notch let's go by another income producing asset\nLet's buy some more income\nPoor people instead say let's go buy some more debt let's go buy a car that we have a payment solved by our house we have to pay payments on let's buy stuff on credit cards we activists so they're buying their debt is buying them payments\nAnd reducing the standard and quality of their life\nWhereas wealthy people are using their credit to go buy assets that are producing income and increasing the standard and the quality of their life now this is so blatantly different that if you're on the radio right now and you're listening to this or if you pick this up on a podcast later on guys\nYou've got to think to yourself which one of these am I\nAm either that guy that just thinks oh my God\nHow can I save enough money to maybe put some money aside how can I get by how can I create a pile we'll call ... college fund will coated emergency fund and we'll call it a retirement fund\nRich people do do that rich people don't have pockets I don't have pockets of money I have cash\nThirty right thirty million in cash that can be spent where I Need to invest it to make the money I Need I don't have it in buckets it may be in\nProbably about thirty or forty different accounts because I've got it spread out so that there's insurance FDIC insurance on but the bottom line is it's there and it's waiting for the next\nBig deal I don't want it there I wanted a deal I Want to buy more income so let's take a look I can take I'm going out and buy an apartment complex right now I can take a part of that money and\nThat money right there probably are as me somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually earning two percent of most of my savings account but so let's say I make three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest eagle boy that's incredible I could live off that the rest of all I'd go oh\nThat's terrible the radio return on that investment is terrible now I go out and buy an apartment complex I met in the process of buying one right now when I buy that apartment itself costs me nine or ten million dollars\nWhich I'm not expecting you to understand is just take zeroes off of all this discussion\nAnd it will make me between nine hundred and a million dollars a year\nNow what's interesting about that is it will make it for me in tax free income\nIn addition to that I mean it's about fifty thousand dollars a month in income if you look at it that way but not counting the other auxiliary or ancillary type incomes and it makes up a bit about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around see fifty times twelve is six hundred thousand dollars\nBut it's paying down the mortgage another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year\nNow what's interesting is the depreciation on this which is the ability to earn income without paying taxes on is somewhere around a million dollars nine hundred and some thousand dollars so all that incomes going to be tax free\nRight and\nIn addition to that because of the new tax laws that Trump past I'll probably get another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of deductions right out of the blocks the right off the gets my other income in other things\nSo you think about this I'm going from let's say nine hundred thousand dollars or any one percent is nine what would that be Ninety thousand a year or two percent a hundred and eighty thousand you're going from a hundred and eighty thousand a year", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year":
