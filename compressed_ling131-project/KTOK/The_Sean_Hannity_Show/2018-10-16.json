that's all it was from day one\nDoctor you keep your doctor you keep your plan oh\nNow the one thing that the Democrats are trying to do and talk about is health care which is somewhat bizarre to me because that is not exactly worked out for anybody\nWhat we have is you know the the the AC a which is the Obamacare what you've lost with the AC a as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yep higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate would tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big\nRedistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts that we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh ...\nAnd Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for

math\nAnd sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happen in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign and say free health care\nFor everybody in the world it's assigned you're basically our governor saying illegal or legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average Californian as that is tax that Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction\nIf people want to experiment with is that you know what ... what am I I'm not there to tell people\nYet and I agree with you and they had on his own business where the thinking gotta get out of California you can't afford to pay taxes and the ...\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas\nYou know what what are the Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing to Texas\nSo unbelievable which is what the beta Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway you know good luck um I Would say John Cox will be a

races that matter can a night\nSo that people can tune in and literally see we've also put up an interactive map on Hannity dot com that people can use and you also see it Christian cinema is imploding out in Arizona\nProject Vera tossed with the tape that they release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on to that same happened a governor governor reticent and Tennessee have Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nAre we now see Heller was very important state of Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll at least eight I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and and the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response to hurricane I remember that benefit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you remember showing the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey a that for Hurricane Sandy hit and the President Obama had the advantage of acting like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney's basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama's member Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so\nYeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager a for a strobe I'm at that time and he said yesterday is why did Senator Warren have to do now\nAll those pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball I always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground than anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at it there's other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate\nYeah and and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state Tennessee read standing\nBeside the weight set it up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better more money than any cat on my gosh eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans and Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats\nAnd now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats went back to al given the history Eighteen or the last twenty mid term I have got against the party in power by an average or something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know what I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that the Republicans keep asking if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think the fact that you you hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the capital hearings and we have seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials that our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because now they're saying it\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some hackers on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nIs not allowed to say the word mob All right stay right there will continue Joe ... he is the media reporter

throughout her case and demanded that she paid legal fees for Donald Trump but for the president tweeting about or today I don't think anyone would is willing to cover it at all\nYou know I I don't I'm trying to figure out who's having a worst month um the New York giants\nElizabeth Warren or Michael ... I'm Sorry I have an audio complete those those two names uh yeah I mean that that's that's pretty big that that was thrown out Sean because [laughter] I mean that's the killer that now stormy is actually responsible for Trump's legal fees I ... and by the way every court case should\nBe ... I'd always gotten ... from the beginning I'm kind of it these are street fighter um but I think what especially during the cabinet hearings with Julie sweating egg\nI mean it was was pretty outrageous 'cause she was claiming almost on a weekend basis you know that Brett Kavanaugh was that these parties and they were drug in these young girls nice boys were lining up in the hall and and gang raping these girls as a matter of the ... almost a weekly thing\nDidn't have it on his ... I Would think a fairly smart guy right and and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to that with this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school repeatedly he went back\nTo parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back and oh I won't be able to actually find anybody that can corroborate the stories at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the for people that Julie sweating except for those parties one dead\nOr to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't know who truly sweating it was so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story but also hurting on it but it in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process and the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe country over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only media he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nAnd he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much quick break right back your calls on the other side of big Hannity tonight tell you about that in a minute including pastor Brunson\nIs going to speak out his first cable interview tonight at nine what it was like in prison in Turkey and much more [noise]\n\nThis report is brought you buy maximus smart security lights at Costco from a CBD plus he was a total traffic studio rabbit himself ... thirty five north of south east Asia and I know I'm thirty five but highly nine west west bound memorial like after ...

up shut up if Democrats [noise]\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand since the day Donald Trump won the left\nIn this country those quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob in some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or terrorists Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera\nAll of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them\nYou follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell them you know wanted anywhere anymore okay well that sounds like you want something bad to happen\nAnd the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project baritone has videos or ...\nIt is either they're not telling Maxine Waters Ted said they keep telling me not to say it then you read the center\nFor American Progress don't talk about immigration because you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's sad that this is what it takes\nFor them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the cheap
