governor the former governor the great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well what does that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about bad we're talking about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well uh ... appreciate you how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know Texas but it's a it's what I call temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected\nWith several people on your staff and I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia where did you know that that was going to entail owners\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners off that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we're\nNow selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent ... and\nUh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs are obviously being a regulator making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as a\nUh as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know as a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that\nOught to be their job it's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining he's ... he's putting terms is going to ruin trade\nAnd in no time flat biggie you stepped up and said we're making the deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade them in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make it part of the deal how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause of secretary of treasury\nMy notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a a a role to play in that and and so absolutely there's a there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team\nAnd I want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know\n... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] a true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine uh and and that's exactly\nWhat he's doing with these trade deals or he comes with some really hard stuff\nMade me think about it with you and then a young and came back in here uh after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs then retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese\n... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later the Chinese know that they will lose\nA they know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customer they don't want to screw with us that would lead them\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want to stay in our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights but good neighbor yeah that that's another big\nPart of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the great guidance of a great job it now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape\nAnd there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it as these things are outdated you know think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about where America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are still a developing a the energy sources that we were buying and\nNow I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different\nPositions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president would say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh U.

mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually help the people of the major amount of people that were paying that find that tax and the an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of pre existing conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you were a big supporter of\nOf the individual choice and health care and the idea that the left somehow is making it a a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care plan and keep it you\n... have their previous reduce probably five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live here or there they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing can be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer every new ability\nOkay so so you give people a greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates and in Wisconsin for example health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mama care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year you know they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I didn't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if he could afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you said it's not going to go and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something but just really reiterate that for me center if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection terms or preexisting conditions you could always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that\nCan't afford they'd been priced out of the bond care exchanges we're giving them an option to be ... to be able to afford\nHealth insurance for once okay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because we're on the one single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects our pre existing condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nOr they think they can win the election but no I mean there are a long term goal obviously is Bernie ... Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts it tore his single payer government run bureaucratic system that will ration care\nWill reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right there by the way that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs more like thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business taxes at least double and they still won't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching to write down the number thirty two trillion\nThey realize how much money that as a Senator Ron Johnson a one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime I ...\nUm when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned it briefly I feel strongly that ... they would you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly but the houses are starting to look like it's up for grabs where this blue wave was being talked about for six months\nDo you think that the moves by ... Feinstein and and uh in Cory bookers barbecues and all these people in that process\nWhere do you think that's going to motivate conservatives and Republicans to get up off their hands and go and vote November\nI sure hope so I don't I don't know ... what else what else can Democrats show the American public to to just create the discussed again if you're not disgusted by their despicable ... behavior God help ya\nYa know I'm I'm with you and I think that it's going to be probably I'm hearing people saying red dawn\nOn on on November or six I'm not really sure what's gonna happen other than people need to go and vote or else it surely will be some sort of a strange blue wave with impeachment talking all this other garbage Ron ... million for the time I always appreciate the knowledge and thank you so much for release straightening out with this individual\nHealth ah this individual's choice and health care really is because the ... going to continue for the next month and you know that\nWe'll have read de ... de Ron Johnson again he's a Republican senator from the great state of Wisconsin always great information and we always appreciate them taking the time your

market as we took a bumpy ride some say a roller coaster some so he just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever the financial markets thing or financial question I always go to my friend Doug gambler use the managing director and senior vice president of investments ruby dreams and associates a Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJoe I'm great thank you so uh all the president has to say that the fed is logo\nAnd that when we get eleven hundred points are due to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know me I think the stock market as a slot machine anyway so I don't really worry about my moral when K still looks great today um but people are freaking out about can you point to one thing that made this happened ... ...\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of things Joe it what's always interesting about the market is\nThings that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrug it off drugs it off and then suddenly it it it matters I think what's kinda manifested here as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough or a photo if you will and in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies are pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil is gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything toward Seventy but still that's much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy so you have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell button\nDo do you have a video ... managing director senior vice president over the room and dreams and associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy [noise]\nWell they have this in a state inflation target of two percent going and then when you start to she mentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure\nWhich is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy as much stronger than it was when President Trump took office you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little barest story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah\nThey want to just right and so they're trying to do that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they are they're aiming to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable Doug I heard today somebody may mentioned that there was a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump accountable you search the tank and he's ... he didn't work all the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational thing to politically people can make this happen\nI that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you are right except for these things go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing director of the vice president of investments a ruby dreams and associates so as\nWe watch this you know Obama when he was an office and I talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or one that wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look I've read I Am I'm\n... of course the left politically is saying we'll see the bubble bursting for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again\nOr are we seeing that maybe you do get too big words bridges yeah no I I think\nSo investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people think it's a bull market or a bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fed some deregulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high\nSince Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet and in that regard I have to tell you this is really\nFor found two things first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in in income or into a household and then what goes out for a ... student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household net worth it in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\n... it's not affecting my spending but it's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales and they've ever seen ever restaurants are seeing more people go out to eat\nThan they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash\nMessaging to raise ...\nEarning your
