these mobs don't stop what they're doing\nAnd the moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program there was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the store story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros his home in his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list or George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop this crap\nHas got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on almost ... you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we've got to clear the halls this ... one of these senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the hose you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video up Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nId they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out and write and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs and then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he's a racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies the bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city\nWhere people are dying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know\nLeading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can\nWe had a pipe bomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and chapel claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters ... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros his home in West\nFoster New York suspicious package Santa Debbie Wasserman Schultz was officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore and watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this\nYou know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security\nIn my life you know Linda you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore and my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had\nThe same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that but it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with report suspicious packages and you\nKnow that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder's another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel\nAnd other top officials in fact that story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that had happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skill least nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin in ... the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend\nPeople I I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that's the least this shooter happen to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I Can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters you're not responsible for that\nBut the media today and their their reaction to this is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting leap partisan\nIt just it they're so quick to blame ... President Trump Fox News talk radio you got this NBC reporter saying that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of extremist fringe but rather mainstream Republican media outlets like Fox News and talk radio\nWork with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage origin nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing ratio\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBased on rock and words date in comparison to public records ritual approval only about thirty thirty approached transactions call for confirmation and conditions equal housing Leonard licensing office he said and I'm like them or thirty thirty additional conditions are excluded may apply\nThis we walk\nHey rock and roll lovers than us us take a journey back to this week in rock and roll history I start off back in Nineteen\nSixty six where the Supreme became the first female group to have a number one album on the U.S charged with a Supreme that go go knocking the Beatles revolver from the top of the sharks\nAlso this week in Nineteen sixty six to the beach boys good vibrations made its debut on the U.

I mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this and\nI and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about I mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter yeah but I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWas going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats and picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and I explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people at restaurants\nAnd attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nOr shows up at your house or spit on you or threaten you or follow you\nI have had all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our for our politicians save whoever did this is not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with Arnie conservative once anything to do it\nBut this rush to judgment we don't know one thing yet who's responsible I immediately the trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat it will say well the president says fake news\nAre they are fake news you know the truth is ... words are very different than actions\nJust like Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to that ... that was incendiary to me I just\nBut you know he's not responsible because not that supports him\nSo unbelievable they apocryphal see how many of you know how many reported that three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to the president\nAnd secretary of defense Mattis indoor FBI Director ray and to our CIA director Gina Haspel\nAnybody even hear about that I didn't hear a lot of concern from people on the left when Don junior when he had gone through that and by the way that's nothing compared to the threats people get needs to this is happening every day\nThis is a very very dangerous political environment\nEverybody needs to take a deep breath you don't like you you you want Nancy Pelosi speaker go vote for you want Chuck Schumer to be said or majority you have the ability to go vote on so and so's governor go vote\nKeep your hands to yourself and uh you know

number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the motives of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director in her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people at Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and\nWe and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the ... on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your toaster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead after what was the moderate voters and play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be selling liberate once you get selected that staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicions that well that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really left or right thing I was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and\nHearing it may I suggest have integrity this\nIs about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to woo the moderates and they and they could only make one choice once\nBut he did not have a choice it's lying is is a a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none at it it's in a hurry to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated as like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but\nThirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say
