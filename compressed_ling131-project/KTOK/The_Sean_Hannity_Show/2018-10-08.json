all your years in the prosecutor's office would you be a bit suspicious of that story\nWell you'd be more than a bit suspicious I mean you just rejected out of hand but showing going forward there's something very special about the Supreme Court you know the fact that the confirmation was fifty to forty eight it's not like where I'm trying to be the point spread\nAdjusts it's now justice cabin on so long the judge Kavanaugh he was confirmed and the Supreme Court just must be above the fray and not send out political signals and I think the editorial he wrote we said the op ed that he was going to be independent impartial\nObviously he will be and I just hope that it does not will the awful things that have happened in the last week did not affect the public's confidence in the independence of the Supreme Court\nWell I think it's going to be interesting and then what we have to ask the question will the party that was responsible for all of this will there be a price to pay in twenty

on the Democrats and all of the activists in protesters and and these special interest groups the polling data Sean is very revealing there was some apathy among Republicans as is often the case in a midterm election\nAnd suddenly that changed and transformed GOP voters into energized and motivated voters to get out on\nElection day next month because they see what is going to happen if they lose the house and the Senate because Nancy Pelosi and Jerry ... who would then become\nA chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Democrats win the house are vowing to a ... exact we're van ... a retribution\nInvestigation to remove calving off those from the Supreme Court by virtue of articles of impeachment and and there's nothing that will motivate of Republican voters more\nThan that kind of us for what undermine the Democratic process of confirmation and to try to stabilize the Supreme Court for partisan reasons\nWell going to be interesting to watch do you think politically John you watch a lot of campaigns is they're going to be is the ... the American people gonna be motivated in twenty nine days and are they going to remember this\nWell I Can't read the tea leaves\nBut what we just saw the confirmation battle actually was a sample of our separation of powers inaction were each branch exercise it's appropriate role and now in our democracy the people are going to decide and

weekend fifty one year old Dominican nasty\nAnd in that application he specifically what wants pages ten through twelve and Seventeen the thirty four they're also looking for the D O D J what are known as thrilled to lose and those are the conversations between Bruce Oren Christopher Steele\nAnd we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann an Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker himself anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some of the keys documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of\nA war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday in this week\nWe're going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produced including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the Bruce or three of one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is tomorrow view getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere ... there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely shocked yup yup bitten by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other into\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any um international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime at and they've been hostile to the United states\nUm we do know that in fact the food and does have a network of\nOf their own deep state operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that well\nIn terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did versus ...\nThe DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you're talking about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a Rome people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington\nWho we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at that I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nEndless of first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had the spies a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't ... I think first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there's a ... a warrant on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the\nTime ... it's funny Sean right interesting sorry I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know and these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox would they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's put it that way but they\nAgain because it's all about you know media perception what were they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged ranked\n... absolutely well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right at the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that did they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior\nThere is a an indictment of or or you know if someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nWell I'd definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMight the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like because I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you ... do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time\nBasically yeah and you know going back many years again and we had talked about how many hours\nTotal do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spent total\nOver the last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean in terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of documents production etcetera right now that's a whole different level\nWhen you went before a mall or what was that like\nYou know I don't I don't like to talk about that ... just because in general they have been a less leaky\nIn terms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and I won't I don't remember that\nNight but I Will I keep an eye back at all absolutely not and you haven't you know and as the is it now they now stopped asking you questions when the last time you got a call from anybody\n[noise] I haven't I haven't talked to anyone in twenty Eighteen\nFrom the CBD plus usa total traffic studio rabbit it was bound to forty at Bryant injury

future lies you know for you and and I think this was all going to end soon as my gas and I don't think so I don't think the president was involved in any collusion he never was I think the big story here is the abuse of power I'm putting the fix for Hillary\nWhat happened to you with the ... the application mourns a I think the abuse of intelligence to weaponize of our intelligence is another big issue and I think there's a lot more to come I think when you hear the News Tomorrow I think you're going to be pretty shocked again\nThat these things really did happen and I don't I in the end I don't want this to hurt law enforcement I Love law enforcement\nI Love oriental community but you can't turn the tools of intelligence as powerful as they are on the American people\nI I fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy so much is just undercover and\nYou know and even as funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations\nThey started saying well our bosses and want to [laughter] you know they I think they saw through it but they knew you know that was back during the\n... era as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever [laughter] don't go to a lot of ...

J. last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hacking or any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as much places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because\nThree of those guys were named Mueller's indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't think there's any doubt that there is no doubt\nAt all that the\nAnd then the hostile regime of Russia be him being a hostile act or that he is that they are constantly trying to you know create chaos in the United states and they're constantly cite cyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something to\nVery few people will tell you and that is at some point we've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nYou know much intellectual property is stolen it's billions and billions of dollars from America's\nSame ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known oh Julian Assange is wanted in his mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D that's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way\nThe fact that we have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have an hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we gotta look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\n... I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with what's with this uh the OJ indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come the fall or\nCan't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look it over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it's damning and you're right but you know understand another thing is that not one of these people that mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody what happened in twenty sixteen\nNow every other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability\nIs at some point it becomes our problem in our fault the fact that Hillary you know we we don't have any doubt that foreign uh services hacked into her email system that was parked in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet nobody doubts any of that we'd better take it seriously", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "08"}
