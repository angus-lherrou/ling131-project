don't want to lose my keys [laughter] so I'm doing all the things I can do out there I Want to keep all the muscle structure I've had for years all that kind of stuff so I Want to help you know how to stay young one of the things\nThat really helps keep the brain sharp and helped bring down information the body\nIs the CBD Oil so I have to talk with me and ... and I've been in radios almost since I've begun almost a Twenty years ago\nAnd so students and I've done on different product lines that he's really um he only works with a very very best things out there so ... what is the difference between your read your green in your goal line of a CDO\nAnd thank you doc for having me back so many times and going back to the well we've done shows about this in the past but let's face it\nThis is new this is disruptive this is confusing and difficult to understand it and I [laughter] I guess you know if you if you're listening to this\nAnd if the path but not regular CBD if not the I don't want to be high what's going on or you're not alone everybody feels that way\nSo we wanted to make it simple with a color coding and once you understand the color coding on the bottle it actually makes perfect sense so there's three colors red green little when you see the red labeled a red product that\nFate a potent anti inflammatory that affect the body meaning the read the label just think body red blood that's what we try to make that connection muscle you hurt your back you want to try to read the label because\nBehaves like a non steroid all anti inflammatory think hemp super food aspirin alternative for daily use it the raw extract nothing heated nothing added nothing taken out of the the the stamina stock the entire plant\nCandidates hemp plant grown in Holland in the Netherlands so that's called our raw CBD a red product for the body\n[noise] it also seems to have some very interesting effects for say a rheumatoid arthritis auto immune conditions and ... and certain cancers are running the CBD\nEight differently than THC\nOr other ... noise so think about ... four\nPotent anti inflammatory would you take both I guess if you do so much cancer of course you\nBut you know yes yes and it's beautiful I was just down in Florida at ... at the big event Dr act Dr Jordan Ruben we spoke yeah more interest than CBD than soup I like bowling broth I bought some

they came back the next day into the health food store the people that followed the directions weren't doing great ready the people that only took one law\nThey were also doing great\nSo what we're giving you as an oversimplification so you really can't make a mistake taking any color red\nGreen or gold we just want to give you a guideline start low and slow so you find the perfect dose and you're playing a the captain now if you will of your own health so the green label that Dr Dan\nUses the green label has been activated what does that mean if you hate it CBD a turns into CBD\nNow it can cross the blood brain barrier the green labels for total body support it's a systemic anti inflammatory that has some neuro Jenike benefits so you think what would\nThe do the CBD a wouldn't do well CBD is more appropriate for all timers Parkinson's multiple\nSclerosis epilepsy hypoxia skinny an injury ... certain pain conditions anxiety depression nausea inflammatory diseases\nOr an inflammatory bowel and Crohn's disease cardiovascular disease and diabetic complications I've sent you a paper that lists all of those and we'll get those posted up on\nYour Facebook page so people can read that list that I just rattled off now you take that stuff that green that you love\nAnd you concentrate it what does that mean you take ten kilos of green to make three kilos of gold\nNow the product is super duper concentrated in fifty percent of it as fact why does that matter fat increases the availability the bio availability and the Africa the by three times\nThree fold increase in bio availability so the gold stuff is for the big gun conditions I'm Talking treatment resistant chronic pain think\nAbout gold mental health strolling it's depression fear gold\nGeneral works on pain too I thought it was more uh working on depression anxiety ah maybe help with epilepsy and some of these other um different organism\nDifferent that they're ... they're they're not redundant the red if the locks and COX inhibitor the high concentrated gold that works on the trip the receptor the same ... receptor that the capsaicin works on that's also great for an old geezer the\nHigh concentrated stuff damp and say hyperactive cytokine storm so where the raw products will modify locks and Cox the gold works further upstream think of new room protection and treatment resistant conditions further\nUpstream or downstream\nUpstream interesting okay\nUp closer to the the the two receptor as opposed to the red which modifies life ... cycle oxygen is like a non steroid all anti inflammatory\nThat we got thirty seconds or so when you finally action\nAnd metabolic health when it's a big bad deal break glass and go for the gold although I read an ad from green find out what works best for you and you'll be valid like a\nRegular class and go for the goat [laughter] I'm like OK votes were talking about plus CBD or by Stevie sciences\nSpotted over town and make it helped us

appreciate you how are you\nA good joke thanks for having me on you know what what\nAn incredible time we're living in right now I Want to get into the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI says was this idiot but\nSent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member\nReally relieved that we got um what what do you think yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history\nOf uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening to blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to green how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a lot and right and we picked or they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it I had to get it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these postal facilities and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e ... advice early on and said you know some let's stop talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that\nUm is there any changing how the media is doing this or ... ... bomber the cold and you know how to get ... ... people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these ... they didn't call him a Sanders shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I would say a Joe I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing so do you want to take some ground there's the second I looked out\nThe was take them I now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear\nHillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder and began to list we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well the pilots happens they made it happen\nI mean we we'd like to see them camp down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy sends out bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy who did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is that the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nBut I had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the raging a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing it contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact that it's thirty five forty years later\nThe media looks back in ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point well thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to redo that the economy for decades and and the prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt it's a remarkable success you have to you again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair\nOr it would be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your jaw I Want to come on but I only been up to minutes and you're like you're\nYou're

side Kevin seem all that success says no\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us

hundred percent what Bush said\nIt was great he couldn't wait to show it to her father for it but at one of his best friend says the same thing you know what I listen I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing\nLast too bad I'm a New Yorker I to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... core short for packing we rule so All right we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like everybody I gotta tell ya my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are\nFighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions Reagan president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional\nFeeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you are and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they're offended by right\nThere is a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius that he does\nA ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm ... says my personality\nI agree it's embodies their most of the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now going to have this great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he said he's running for president were you surprised I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty bad guys were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your\nSome of your policies and you know we we let the band declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took him a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely looked for a cost an out and tries to tell me your fake news ... editor in Anacostia eats it\nUp he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but again I thought that it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened\nBut um when you were in that job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what\nAdam ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe we announced era as the press secretary I did the first press conference and I'm so sorry that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net my calms plan\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context to\nEat was being very of secrets and flattering to me any begging me effectively to do a profile story within reason\nTrail me around and I'm like well I'm not the ban and I'm not there are still promoting myself run I use of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that guy changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\nIn you know

I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of did his hands in a similar fashion and made you know spoken to in a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good just go to YouTube use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even consider running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo is he ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when reporters didn't do a report until two veteran sixteen\nOr maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not sometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he does is he is that way and he speaks that way do look at me and double trouble um stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant would hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and one not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker what's fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong\nAnd don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide know squat and I'm angel in New York and I know more than you you may in fact at the end of the day no more than I Do but you failed in any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level with anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you a straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics work so bring it next time I get a little but you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate jour you\nI'm just great to be when you\nHave really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention or it appears to be a plane of some sort and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that that are at fourteen and Jen is one of the famous jets that little off the carrier or a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots when they came after our fleet at one point in Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that really got him under control didn't it\nAnd Reagan in good what the media before he ran or we get the feeling that he was\nThey were actually wasn't it was like oh yeah yeah you know I mean do you got to remember\nReagan started off as an outsider even with his own party everyone many many fucking was way too far to the right so but at the end you have to remember to a one week before Reagan's first election he was down to Jimmy Carter by ten points you know it was nicer that he would have when\nAnd when he came to office the press you know he was just a meal Don ... those you know right wing not\nEverybody about bedtime for bombs that was headlined everywhere right\nAbsolutely and now you know they make fun of writing and say I can only speak if he was speaking off of three by five car and you know it wasn't smart wasn't well read it was that was absolutely not the truth and I think as Reagan continue to warm\nAnd like Trump sixtieth and achieve those goals uh they they they had to change their mind about Reagan I think by the time he got into a second term\nThey started understanding what they had the front of them already saw reading him for a success was but it really did take you know darn near or one or two more president Xi's before the press release start a small apartment and\nIt's kind of amazing or a last question and I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repair relationships where do you see him going forward just doing exactly what worked so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's a failure use hormones or something ... something years but the bottom line is\nThese crowds of a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see them doing going forward\nYeah if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control I don't think even\nIf you walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing hall at the press is not going to happen and and that's because\nIt's interesting it is not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media but but now that the media has made the decision to go to war with Trump yeah that's a very different thing I don't think the media and I I think they kind of a well you know that kind of ... now\nAnd and now they're they're they're in an enemy can't run against him no matter what I don't think there's a truth that's on the horizon ever and I think that's going to be the case and sold a bill ... hops aboard Marie once logical circle around the city\nI I agree with that I I Believe he's absolutely right it's an reduces about two we appreciate John Hi Bush or back after
