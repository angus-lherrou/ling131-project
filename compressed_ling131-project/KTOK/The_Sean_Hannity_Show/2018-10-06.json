{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "You pay me for a hundred and fifty dollars do this return for you a suggestion that you look and see how this money is being\nYour income plan to see if you can lower your taxes and their their job is just to do your tax not\nDifficult we're we're not CPAs and if we can pick up a tax return and looked at very front page of your ten forty and about five seconds till where your money is coming from and while you're paying a lot on taxes from I guarantee your CPA can do the same thing if you're not getting that and certainly we can we can help in that regard and help steer you in the right direction [noise]\nOne of the other dark sides ah that that we deal with and we see this a lot and unfortunately this is one that uh if you live long enough you're probably going to be with this one\nAnd we're talking about diminished mental capacity greatest fear among retirees is running out of money Okay Number one but on probably right underneath that is the fear of diminished mental capacity being aware of that your mind\nOr the mind of a loved one is slipping is a really terrifying thing okay when you know and you're mentally aware enough and you can tell the little by little parts of you are being chipped away at that's terrifying and it's sad\nIt's terrifying for the loved one it's terrifying for the spouse if terrorists just terrifying and you don't want to accept it there I mean I think about um a client that called me one night and she was telling me that her husband\nWas using different words for an an object like an apple and he'd say ... can you hear me one of those I was bringing one of those apples\nAnd she says a capital he's never eaten apples and he meant the on the counter was about ... orange and and she's like\nShe thought it was weird and then the next week something else happened in the ... it just kept getting worse\nAnd what they found out was finally they took advantage of having examined and he had a golf ball sized tumor on his brain and it was pressure the pressure was making him you know not be able to to pick a word that he knew that he would call something different I mean\nIt was terrifying to him and it was a terrifying to her\nYeah because you know to the the ability to think and walk and do all these things\nYou know we understand getting injured but when something just begins to happen to your brain and you don't feel it ... your brain as as the Oregon on your body has no pain receptors your brain itself feels no pain you don't feel yourself happening this these things happening\nBut you see the results and um this is one of the ... one of the areas that\nUm it can it can affect you personally but you can also see when you have diminished mental capacity other people are out there ready to take advantage of that and you've got to be aware of these red flags um before you had a situation like this um with one of our clients named Katie\nI'm Katie has been a client of yours for a long time I know and she was pretty successful she was a psychology is okay very uses her brain all the time in her work but we started noticing a few little things here and they're they're just seemed odd and out of place\nAnd it continued for law and had run days were much better someday are much worse and we all noticed it and we show jelly would\nNotice that when she would talk with her you know we're ... times a day\nYou know when someone comes in and says this is not Katie and that means is is not the case that we've now we we all know what that means in our office and and you'll feel the same way with a loved one ... you're the one that knows them best so when you feel that and it's like this they're not all there there there are a prime suspect right now for\nThat and for people to take advantage of and we hear horror stories all the\n... yeah and that's why you know\nYou've got to be aware of these red flags when you took an additional step because sometimes it's very difficult to talk to the person whose mind might be slipping and as it turns out\nShe had been diagnosed with early onset dementia that's what we that's what we ultimately found out but sometimes it's very difficult to mention that or talk about it to the person so you took the step of looping in one of her family member\nYes and and I did that and you know we hold the confidentiality of clients\nYou know to the way to the extreme however when this happens you've got to be able to to be able to have a family member that you can talk to\nThe person also needs to power of attorney and so you should have those documents and we had those documents and said you know had 'cause they're out of state and said you know have you in the conversation is simple like have you taught your lately and Oh yes and so and so and I said well she was really concerned that you\nUm hadn't told her that you were going to Hawaii\nAnd taking the family and he said\nNo it Korea blah blah blah associate just led into because of the conversation I Know both families it was easy for me to say we don't want to give her a cock his ear feelings for a little heart and she's a little confused about that and he said really\nOkay and so then he calls her and then we can all now have a conversation right because we've ... alerted him because again they're out of state we're talking to her more than he is right now he's got two little kids in his life yeah he's got a successful business ... you know this is what happens\nSomebody though it's got to stay alert someone and whether it's ... if you had the power attorney that's that's one way to do it as well\nYeah well and also having a power of attorney can protect your loved one\nOr you and if someone you've identified someone else later on in life and you should do this as a part of your state plan\nThat will handle your financial and medical decisions in the event that you are incapacitated physically or mentally and so that someone doesn't just come in or that you don't on the phone sign of ... you know give someone information or sign away on a document and you don't know what you're doing\nAnd I can tell you they they said that the uh the biggest thing in this just came in are the e continue education ladies it that\nIt is women we are more trustworthy we just believe it when somebody tells us something and women are being scammed especially there's an age bracket as late seventies mid eighties were\nDose of the ladies that are getting scanned them up\nAnd if you had a loved one in that age I think about it if they get scammed and let's just say they take all the money out of their house you can't get it back where are those where's your love I'm going to go yeah they're they can live with you\nSo we do as families as we're getting older it used to be taboo to talk about many issues and I'll still not my family my mother she's at that age and she is still a taboo they can't pass the fact that it's a taboo subject\nAnd it's really not so we talked about it over the years with mom that you know we just want to make sure she is taking care of and not taking advantage of so somebody does approach her\nJust call someone\nGet they get a family member to get a second opinion because they'll they'll stop a scam in the heart of hearts story on that two daughters getting involved with their mom sends getting involved in finding out that yes it was a scare\nAnd unfortunately it happens to women more often than men super because women live longer so you have a higher likelihood ladies of these things happen to you just for simple fact of living living longer\nAnd they think because your spouse is gone you had more money but if you're a senior citizen you're female you're tired there are ...\nWho look at the obituaries they are good people who have who are in grieving who are you know dealing with situations so and you're listening right now because you know retiring well as an easy but you're not quite sure where to turn to\nSo you know that you can go lots of places in good guidance on Social Security in taxes in income planning and that sort of thing you expect any good financial advisor to do that\nBut here's the deal not every financial advisor will do some of the other things you're looking for and you're looking for someone to hold your hand and say it's going to be OK I'm going to give you control back over your life we're going to take care of you were going to be that safe harbor for you to come and ask questions\nThere on a stupid question okay you're dealing with your money here and we know it can be scary sometimes that's what our team or chop wood financial does we sit with you hold your hand and walk through that entire process\nYou know may have our clients have said at least one million or more for retirement so many of the strangest we discuss here on the show work really best for them however we also know and appreciate that many of you are working to become millionaires that's Damon started a millionaires club\nNow they've been has five time slots available this week for those who do have five hundred thousand save for retirement or someone that died and he can sit down thirty minutes to two an hour depending on the complexity of the issue\nAnd helped give some guidance and get that second look to be sure you're planning properly you protected yourself so that you didn't live that next chapter happy it's like your dream home it's a dream retirement\nWe want to make sure everybody runs every time I look forward to see any of this way and until they\nWant you to rocket retirement I remember my best if I don't take advice for people physically financially or serious

and\nYou know they're kind of like they're falling apart sometimes and you'll actually see people the kind of the range it's almost like the go to a turtle mowed the head comes down the shoulders come up they scrunch up they go into a gunfight are kind of a stance or draw\nAll takes time all that is wasted motion watch somebody like Chris Serino Mack Smith show a decade Rob lake's them cheering Mitch sick\nWhen they draw nesting moves except their hand\nPainted there are I mean there's no shoulder move there's no hit moving nothing moves because all of that is wasted motion and wasted motion takes time\n[noise] so what you do is you in the privacy of your own home with an air soft gun or a BB gun or a federally absolutely triple check on loaded\nFirearm you work on smoothly you don't work on fast trust me on this I mean it's one of those you really have to trust me you work on smooths not fast so what are you going to you're going to\nWork on your draw work on clearing your garment slowly smoothly ... you're you're becoming um an efficiency expert if you will\nHow am I going to do this I'm going to if it's a shirt over my gun I'm going to use two hands\nI'm going to reach down with both hands and pull up the shirt anti as I can okay if you're right near to imagine that just kinda follow along with you if\nYour right hand you're going to have put her hand on either side of the gun front back up again you're going to grab that shirt and you're going to pull it up as high as you can only up to your armpit I don't care yeah you've got to show your belly get over it\nAnd then you're going to continue to hold their shirt up with your left an sorts completely out of the way why you reach down with your right hand and get a good purchase on the grip notice I say you don't grabbed the gun you get a good purchase on the grip you get your buyer wean grip while it is in the holster\nIf that takes you an extra fraction of a second that's okay\nBecause you want to have your firing grew up on this gun before it comes out of your holster\nNow you're going to continue to hold that shirt up with your left hand search out the way now with the firing grip you've got the gun to piss when you're in you're going to come straight up with it as far up as you physically can tell it's up under your armpit and here's the trick here guy pro tip\nDo not chill the muzzle up with your wrist but rotate your right elbow down at which point when you do that that guns going to come up it'd be a target at that point\nBut you could shoot if you had to your left hand is right in the middle of your chest still heard of that shirt your right hand has the pistol and editors right against or petrol muscle right side and if you had somebody on top of you you could shoot right there\nIf you don't and you want to extend that gun out now slowly practices very slowly\nYou're going to release to share it with your left hand you're going to marry or two hands up right next to your chest so that now you have to edit grip and you're going to slowly extend this guy on all the way out and has it starts to come into your vision you start to pick up the front site called the gun and as you extend all the way out\nYou're on the front side hard focus on the front side then you've gotta practice during a trigger press click\nThen the finger comes off the trigger goes straight out and you stop you're going to look both sides who right left and right and you're going to slowly do they re holster this is how you can practice it home\nAnd you know there's no saying I I guess it was the heck was that Malcolm Gladwell so you've got to do something\nTen thousand times to be really ... well I don't know that we can get ten thousand some games some can't\nBut if you do it a thousand times I guarantee you you're going to be a whole lot better than you were before\nSo you know you could do that drink commercial breaks if you're watching TV if you're watching ball games whatever happens to be you get up you do that ten times not fast\nResist the urge I Know I Know I Know but I Want to see how fast you know of course you\nFast will come trust me fast will come\nBut if you try doing it fasted first you're going to have bad habits you're going to groove those bad habits\nAnd what you want to do is do it slowly enough it I'd have to be like super slow but slowly enough where it becomes very smooth it just ... down do you get your gun just movement backup you marry your hands comes out in front of the boom All right then you stop taking bras come back we hope to do it all over again\nDo that ten times and they do tend more times if you're a hundred times during the day which is very easy to do a hunger draw during the day\nThen it does take that long\nBefore you're at a thousand and then you're ten thousand and you're moving pretty quickly and it's all working for you when you go to the range you know what you're going to be good\nBecause what you're doing you're not only to working on the draw but you do something that you're working on your eyes to focus because you want\nTo move from the target that you're shooting got their eyes and then draw that focus back from the target to the front side get hard focus on the front side and then you're working on the trigger press\nWhile the fronts hype isn't sharp hard focus and then you're working on the trigger finger comes off the trigger and your focus couldn't go back out to the target\nIf need be All right pretty simple stuff and you don't want that cost you nothing no ammo know anything [noise] it's a really great way to practice now imagine you do that if you're a hunter do the same thing with a rifle you've got it on\nYour shoulder you should be taken off your shoulder you swing it around you ... you put it up your shoulder then you showed her you're on your look through the scope and you press the trigger on a thoroughly unloaded rifle\nHolding those costs years on a target you can practice that in your home over and over and over and each time to do it now you worked a boat\nAnd one more search click worked about click so that what you do you want to ... and after the last ... hours worked about every time it goes quick or every dominoes bank ... you don't just sit there\nWith a fire round and empty hall cartridge case in your guy what good is that\nIf you shoot a trophy animal you sit there and my right and then he jumps up takes off and you haven't worked boat holy cow\nYeah how do we know that because it's happened to maybe a lot of\nUs [laughter] what do you practice I'm just curious\nDo you how do you practice do you do any facts at home ... duty work with your life will you shot guns or his all your work done at the range of curious looking for your age I'm ... now what's your practice real what is your ... how do\nAt all the six six talked gun or Tom talk [noise]\nWhen the U.S military's elite unit and law enforcement agencies across the globe demanded innovation and reliability they didn't settle they chose ... shower\nWhen world champion professional shooters demanded precision accuracy they didn't set they chose

the link\nAnd you can read about it or tell people about it started the Colombian\nWow I mean and that's the kind of stuff we talked about and just I don't want you to go anywhere because we'll get to arrange board I Want to point out people something\nThe training that you have for self defense against people is not really a kind of shooting you're going to be faced with and that kind of situation\nYou're ... you're really going to be looking at a contact shot\nAnd hope you understand what I'm Talking about here is a dog is on someone else will be thrashing around and they're gonna be flying all over the place and what you don't want to do shoot the person who's being attacked by the dog or dog [laughter] you don't shoot you want to shoot the dog\nSo what you're going to want to do is show the muzzle into the side or the gut or the leg or the head or whatever you can sign of a dog and pulled the trigger while you are pointing the gun and making sure that you get a pass to go through the dog is this the person\nAnd then here we go guys this or training comes in when you make eye contact shot with a semi automatic isn't an excellent chance of two things one\nIs that you could take the gun out of battery which means you're going to shove forward to the slide comes back a little bit and it won't go bang that's when you grab the club does sound weird if you've never done it before\nYou can with a semi automatic nine forty five it doesn't matter put your thumb on the back of sly push forward pulled the trigger it's not going to heat up it's not even gonna hurt it's weird but it does it\nAnd then you're going to have to rock the slide because you have just induced a malfunction so you're going to go contact shot push forward or keep the slide for pulled the trigger bank then reach over ... getting ready to do it again if you have to\nHelp an accurate or ... unbelievable I never thought I'd never thought\nOf doing that with the semi ah I I well I I was is no way you can practice at is there\nBut yeah there is actually a if you can get to arrange that has a three D. people don't ... you can see all the gun right into one\nAnd you'll find that if you push the going forward it will come out of battery the slide would go back like ... and it will disengage will not believe a fire sue you can either wrap your if your right hand to wrap your left hand over the top of the slide push forward with that and shove it into this dummy\nA and pulled the trigger now the slides not going to come back so you now have a malfunction cheese rip the slide back just do a malfunction grill\nA or and this is like I say it sounds weird but it works the first time you do you think this is this is stupid [laughter]\nWhat's your song behind the slide push against something and pulled the trigger\nAnd the slightest not gonna tear your thumb off it really isn't as simple I mean it just simply works Garry I Want you to hold on if you could I Want to get you arrange report would come on the or the back side of this and they were going to have a guest coming in but uh I I definitely want to get that and I don't quite have enough time here severe you keep holding will come back to your second\nThis is the kind of stuff I'm Talking about why would you carry I don't know I don't know what's going to be\nSaid ordeal is if I knew I was going to face a threat and I knew what was going to be I wouldn't go there\nI Would see kind of decline limitations right supervisors gunfight pieces of gum would you take if you had to go to like I Will not go\nI go to a dog what do you go to whenever the attack because I don't know that's why she's here because I don't know what's gonna happen out there and that's why I\nSay you care to God where is she right\nBack [noise]\n[noise] now is the time ...\nGood morning just to\nYour mission shoot you decide to accept it is the host of radio show that will bring themselves to the fire moms writes in this sort of luck to\nAnd your Tom Russian gun\nWith your six six talk gunner Tom talked gun magic number here we're talking with Gary on Washington state's got a a range of poor for about a ... helping a lady what went up ...\nOh yes I I knew I had to go to the range when I lost my paper couldn't find her for a few months and then realize as my range bag and it was time to go the range\nSo I went to the range and there was a lady that came in with two gentlemen and there was another lady you know the other guy and the other side and the lady is what the gentleman I Would say she was a Japanese said she couldn't you can tell she had never been into range you see how nervous [laughter]\nAnd the other lady kind of took her side shoulders of hand showed her some hand grips are owned by the way she had pink bullets I've never seen that\nShowed her some hand grips and all that kind of stuff but didn't really have to shoot the other two guys are blasting away and they really messed up their target and then they had or shoot a couple obviously they could she couldn't see where she was shot\nRight so I asked her if she would like to try and try and my little ah three eighty a rogue or L. P. C. to uh anyway um I have a green laser on it uh\nI I had her there and we were seven yards and I just put up some prairie dog a target and you know a first of all I can I ask her if she had any double ears on she didn't have the ear plugs\nAnd so I had to put a set of those underneath their mouth [laughter] like you suggest and then I had her dry fire three or four times and then she hit that those prairie dog every time all the shots\nFirst one right through the head she would just beaming like you know they do ah so I just thought I'd let you know the ranger parked there\nThat is terrific well good on you for taking the time and making the the effort to go over and say hey can I help you with that maybe you'd like to try this you know settled deal is shooting this long when he hit stuff and it's not hurting us so the double up the ear plugs in months in indoor ranges as a great idea Gary thank you so much that is the kind of a gun talk\nOutlook that we like to do that to our outreach program they're speaking of outrage sent me a break and I guess right now I'm Michael ... it's been called the most on gun gun guy around the guy there's a spare time on a number of years as a fashion model also now working in the farms industry\nOr the president of eagle or enterprises a burst of natural arms grand power fire and brand you know all these brands Michael good to have your man\nThank you for having me on and give me the opportunity\n... absolutely I mean you you know I don't know why people call ya on gun got your gun guy man you got\nAll these different brands of guns to bring it into the country in really good pistols and things are how how does that plant will come about\nI think it's because of the way I grew up I grew up in New Jersey in San Francisco and kind of a ... a lot of time hanging out with a lot of liberal places\nAre not legally in that community [laughter] right right okay well\nYeah ... ... and all that kind of about ... [laughter] oh it's kind of like the joke of everyone like oh this is cute guy got yes I Am yes of course\nYou are now one of the things we talked about in the past and I know that the the second the foundation has been getting that way out there in front of another people coming along is basically\nKind of ... in the farms world we talk about not just accents but suicides are the number one a type of firearm deaths there is and we always say well that's a mental health issue is not a gun issue but that's kind of talking past the problem isn't it\nAbsolutely it is I mean that's that's the first of all if you take out suicide obviously we go over sixty percent of beyond us we'll be wiped out which would be a huge number four spit on\nAbsolutely people don't realize and that's not organization walk the talk of America was credit for that it's a let's stop saying well it's a mental health is you know let's\nWork with mental health and try to mitigate the trauma that that is associated with suicide and these mass shootings right and that's that's really what's important [noise]\nOkay so walk the talk America what is it and wants to do\n[noise] basically it's an organization that I I started about three months ago which is that's that's really a story in itself a where it's come in the street months but we have reached out to the other side we call the other side and\nBasically said look we have a industry leaders are in the street we understand what you are guilty just and and I should trucking says this is how a mental health America which of August the oldest running\nA mental health association now or mental industry organization that has been around so basically I reach out to them and said look you don't like the stigma that we place are you guys right because we do that as an industry we get people blame blame the gun we naturally become defensive\nWe said no it's mental health\nAnd they sit there and go whoa whoa whoa it's mental health don't do that you're treating a stigma that statement that makes it so people don't want to go get help\nWe don't want to lose their rights summit America's saying look you know knock it off of the stigma because that's what's happening that's what happens when people do it they don't speak up because they don't want to lose their coverage [noise]\nMuscle is fantasy league only fitness is ... this is what Mr\nAnd we were ... you know and I started to realize why is it not working for me what's working for Rob and I'll tell you why because we're all different yeah these days people are like\nMy best friend is doing the paleo diet and spent working for me my best friends have Egan but it's not working for me ... have you figured out what your best\nThing ... and is it different at forty whatever then it was at Eighteen I mean your your best self your best diet your best training have you figured out what's individually best for you\nThink it's constantly changing us as we develop and you know what's interesting coming back to that even at Fifteen sixteen years old guy you were absolutely eat up in a neighborhood with health and fitness you are doing what you were born to do you saw pieces of that in the very beginning\nAnd you always where I went to you for information I may have had the gun I I went to file for information already now and you\nKnow it's interesting because we're going to do this a lot Rob you're going to come on the show if if you're cool with that what you just keyed in on is something that's super important and that is a bigger part of the health story which is a beyond physical\nIt's mental emotional it's it's doing what you're built to do it's doing what you're born to do finding that\nFinding that men and and uh\nI honestly I think that that's what you do you assign company\nI Do called the signs and all night so you go around the city you guys and you go to a restaurant you go to a gas station you go to these different places and there's always a big sign up there there's a good chance that robs company made that site that's what you've done for a lotta years forever I'm standing on top of that\nThing that is what was it it's funny because in the same way with you I could see it back when we were teenagers I Will take you back\nTo uh the era where there was a band called in excess uh in the eighties we loved him love angle wanted to Michael ... and so you walked in one day with the Jean jacket on the\nBack and had this in excess thing and it had this guy to kind of look like and it was it at drawing was at a patch I don't know what it was and I said where did you get that these like I didn't get any where I made it down and he had this\nArt history but he wasn't like one of those artist who's drawing mystical dragon\nStuff it was cool stuff right okay I think that's cool but\nIt and I had it in nerdy I don't care about lord of the rings\nDrawings I care about what you did and fast forward to in your forties and this is what you've been doing was it hard to figure out this has everything to do with health was it hard to figure out\nWhat pets you were going to take or was it a natural thing once you found that this is a thing that you can apply your art history and your love of entrepreneur ship all into one place how would\nHow did that happen I think those seeds were all always there I think I don't I think the scientists found me was I was able to express myself the love and I think if we look into our lives\nWe can see those seeds and all we have to do is develop and you're doing what you were made to do so again I mean you guys are doing what you might to do\nSo talk about then there are a lot of people listening right now and they're not doing what they're made to do they chase the dollar they chased what their parents expectations word they chased whatever or they missed out on chasing that they think I'm they wanted to do it but\nThere are so many people I talked to and their health is a rack\nAnd you know I did end that what I've done that where I got out of things and chase money ... and and I was successful at it but my health\nSuffered you know what I'm Talking about in my thirties I was highly successful but me and he was coming I hated into spies what idea wow I didn't want to go to bed at night because I didn't want to wake up the next morning to do what I had to do all over again even with success in my health was declining\nMy exact words was all be dead before I'm forty you said I said no and I would have been my gosh\n... Rob mentioned something in the first segment and man we cannot breeze over because when he said it it just it for me because it's been my journey over the last Twenty years\nHe talked about just stepping in the cage was okay he he went from an event lifestyle\nIn his mentality and shifted that too I can enjoy the process each day I can look forward to each day as it unfolds rather than saying when I Do that when I get there in the cage and win that fight then then there's nothing left to live for after that you don't learn how to smell the roses and I'm like\nOh I Would love for him to address that because he just kinda breezed over that and that's like that's a big deal\nWell and I've done that I've lived that life in those moments of what we call successor victory are tiny they're

that uh people of of whatever gender whatever your background what it doesn't matter\nI when I talk to people uh I used to do nutrition counseling and I can't believe how many times that the\n... there was symptoms that were physical but the problem was not physical the problem with something with a how their life was going ... how they perceive life how they dealt with pressure how they dealt with anxiety\nDisappointment all of these things go into it and it is a lot of people really are looking for the belt the victory that\nTiny little moment and I talked to somebody just last night big\nLeague [noise] money guy\nAnd he's like where's the joy man [noise] I I Can't find it I said I I this was what I work half my life or and I haven't got someone telling you as a man thanks in his heart so easy and male moment sinks in her heart so is she\nThis is the kind of thing where at every age I Want you to find your best self folks I Want you to be inspired by stories of people who are doing it [noise]\nWho are not just looking for that grain of sand ... looking for\nThe pleasure of the beach itself you got to come back Rob sir you got to come back this was fun things were going to

Josh bell you thanks for being much honor McGregor\nKept can't way\nAnd when I re something thank you Dr Bryan Frank I'll make a health and thank you for\nI Love you will see next week right here on super [noise]\n\nWhy after him Ninety six point one agency\n[noise]\nThis is a\nFox News alert on Rogers during its official Brett Kavanaugh will be the next justice on the Supreme Court the Senate confirming him just one hour ago by those slim as the margins\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nExactly that you're giving yourself a very realistic goal that you can meet and when you meet that goal it's sixty five years of age and retire you have completely become successful being mediocre\nYou are now a mediocre human being\nBut what's wrong with that as if you've been mediocre through your entire life because you never stressed your abilities you'd never kept into your real power because you set wimpy goals if you sit wimpy goals you get when the results\nSo I Would like to suggest you that this guy is getting it wrong and maybe we can help them out by just give him a little more information that there's really two types of goals in your life\nThere's short term and long term goals there's big goals and then there's monitor or momentary steps in between where you take that goal you break it up into bite sized pieces\nSo if I were to say I want to retire in five years or less\nThat's probably an unrealistic goal according to this guy I'm sure to most people that's unrealistic yet we have people who are lifestyles do it over and over and over and over again now once they decide that that is their goal then we're going to sit down with some short term goals right\nAnd the short term goals are going to be set up to get something done in a time period\nA short time period in other words guy the other day said his wife told him if you can do this stuff I Want you to buy the first house within thirty days and he bought the purse house within thirty days she told if you're going to go out for apartments I Want the first apartment complex within forty five days or Ninety Days whatever what any he went and got it within Ninety Days\nThose short term goals where he focused on one topic of the time\nBut they did not and we're not in our not even today is long term goal is long term goal might be you know I think he said he wanted to be like Robert Martinez so he wants to own apartment complex or better there up have an incredible business have incredible employees have incredible life\nAs a big unrealistic goal for a guy that only own nine houses and even four years ago didn't even know nine houses now he wants to own apartment complex wow so here's this guy tried to convince people in a seminar in a video that was set out\nThat you should have wimpy little goals\n[noise] man let's think about this for saying\nHow do you set a goal set a goal you've got to ask a question and you have to ask the right question for example I Want to lose weight I can tell you how to lose weight if you ask yourself how to lose weight it's very simple stop eating\nRight you'll lose weight but does that really what you want I can tell you another way\nWorkout twelve hours a day every day and you'll lose weight but does that really what you want so you're not asking the right question you could lose a hundred pounds\nOr you can lose twenty pounds and gained it all back the next week so losing weight is that really the questions that really the goal the goals to lose weight and then to gain it right back again that's not really the goal is but you have a defined the goal and if you don't find the goal the goal will define itself\nSo how many of you start at a diet and exercise program and say I'm going to lose some weight\nAnd you do you lose five or ten maybe Fifteen or twenty pounds but you never get all the way to where you really want to be and you don't in most cases maintain what you've already accomplished she asked the wrong question\nA better question would be how could I lose Fifteen pounds how could I lose twenty five pounds of very specific them out\nAnd that would be a better question because you know whether you've succeeded or not when you lose Fifteen pounds\nYou've succeeded right but that may not get you where you really want to be\nA better question is what if you lose the Fifteen pounds and gained it back\nA better question is going to be how do I lose Fifteen pounds and didn't maintain that loss that's the key asking the right questions is going to create direct results but they've got to be giant giant goals 'cause if you shoot for the\nMountaintop you're going to hit the ... if you shoot for the stars you're going to take a short break pick this up on the other side will be right back to fill wants to\nBe [noise]

version at a mom's\nBack to the radio show today was disgusted with you a different concept the concept is one of dead equity and what it's doing to you as a human being or as a family with your investments and I do this and\nLived seminars in a way that really probably doesn't work on the radio but I go through it for you because if you listen to pocket is if you drive and you're probably not going to get this but if you listen to the podcast and by the way if you are driving listen to the shows you should realize that there are a pod cast\nOf every show I Do that you can go back to and listen to again if you'd like to so if you miss the slide but\nWhat everybody do is add up their total net worth so that would be the value of your net value of your home after you take off the mortgage or your four one K. your IRA your savings accounts year uh stocks and bonds\nYour cash savings all your assets\nIncluding a little Billy's college funds all of your money at it all up what are you what is your net worth most people don't even know that that's the first thing you should do is you know what your network is uh you can't have a goal like we are talking last segment about a goal something you don't even know what it is and your network that's really the secret to wealth\nUm you you got to be able to build that network and secondly you not only do you want to build and protecting or do you have to have a return on it\nAnd if you don't have a return on it than it's useless even having a 'cause all you're going to do is you get to spend it one way or another whether you spend it now you spend it later just spending it so the network has to have a return to what I Want you to do is add up your network than what I Want you to do is take an add up all your passive income\nFor a year ago two thousand Seventy and pass income is going to be you know interest income\nRoyalty income net rental income that's the net amount after all the costs expenses that goes with it a net rental income\nUh it's those things that come to you from investments know by the way\nA a retirement account is not passive income that's Vern deferred earned income in other words you've already earned it and now you're getting paid it\nRight this deferred compensation so that is not earned income uh or is not passive income uh four one K. money if you're pulling money out of four one K. that is not passive income because of four one K. is earned income you put it in there you're Puerto matched it because you had a job\nSo which get ashes up as what income producing assets do I owe and how much income that I own even if I didn't go to work how much income would I earn\nIn two thousand Seventeen\nNow the next step is to take the income and divided by the network and what you have is a return on your net worth\nWhat most people find when we do this live is it Ninety Ninety Ninety five percent of the people have less than one percent return on their network now do you expect your family to get anywhere financially when you're making less than one percent on your network\nThat's a very scary thought to try to figure that out how you think you're going to get rich on that or how you got to live off that even if you had an idea where it's the only made half a percent or tend to ... percent I mean you're talking about they don't even have a percent return and they have a tenth of a percent return\nIs what you're looking at now that's about Ninety percent of the people and then some people have some investments see another night another five percent to six or seven ... set more so you're up to like Ninety five Ninety six Ninety seven percent and they're making somewhere between\nOne and five percent return on their network\nAnd that's because they've employed this capital to do something\nRight now the problem is some they might even be making deals and make a hundred percent return on a real estate deal but that hundred percent than is divided out across\nEight hundred thousand dollars with a network that it doesn't really mean anything because it's a very small percentage so they have lowered this return even though they're out there doing stuff that's very successful investments\nBut they lowered the rate of return of those are the best ones by having too much equity so the number one thing that kills an investor is dead equity that's money sitting there doing nothing what are the worst culprits the worst culprits\nSo your personal residents your four one K. and your IRA now I Know you think that you've got\nFour hundred thousand or ... or your four one K. I'm Sorry you don't because you have to give up half of it to take it out even if you're waiting to your six fifty nine and a half you still have to pay your income tax rate on that money to get it out\nSo you don't have what you think in there so it's really kind of delusional you know you're thinking wow this things making the money but it isn't\nBecause you never got it if you don't get the money you are earning the money this is something you have to understand in Chile you earn money and get it where you can spend you having to say well it's on a piece of paper called my four oh one K. and I see that numbers on that piece of paper getting larger sure and they will in 'til the day they don't\nAnd that day they might go backwards on you\nSo you can't say well I was up to five hundred thousand now I'm Down to three hundred thousand so but I made the two hundred ... know you never made the two hundred thousand guys\nThat's the problem you're not seeing it for what it really is\nYou've got to get that personal residents which you got four hundred thousand dollars you personally ... of your life savings in that house what is it or knew nothing\nDo you still have to pay taxes you pay it off the Oregon what do you still have to pay the taxes yes you still have to pay the insurance yes you still have to pay for maintenance and repair yes you still have to pay you know get to spend time and money to ... to ... whatever that maintenance I guess\nAll of that stuff but you haven't earned a dime by paying it off none if you get sued and it's not your personal residents say it's a rental property they can take it away from you it's just the thought of paying off the house is so common\nYet so ignorant in every way shape and form there's absolutely nothing logical about paying off your personal residence", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "06"}
