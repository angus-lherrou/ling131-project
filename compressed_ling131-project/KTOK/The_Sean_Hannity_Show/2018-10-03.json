what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation\nYou know I I Want to get into what this whole means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that\nObviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all\nPresumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about your rights\nFundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page a tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and\nHe got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance\nThat have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this and I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with\nRemember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already that they in the case of\nProfessor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in you know then we learned about\nMystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that\nShe had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event and the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as you said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person the backup or story one of the names was dead another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is and they still ran\nThe story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news and yet that is what the media now does that were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well well they weren't exactly\nWind up in the hall um well he was in ... I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official\nA teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that\nHave the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the

about how he behaves finance jobs\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel\nAnd ex boyfriend of professor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the Ford\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believe was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on\nSeemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment and services that look these are the small\nDetails to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said they were for people that could corroborate her story none of them\nCan corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault\nSaid it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the poor people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to asked the same questions\nIf they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken\nTo professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume that they're\nThey're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise] um you know it's just I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means\nBecause what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter\nLindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor Ford and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of

gonna be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion\nSeen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really to the Democrats that would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh there'll only do it I Believe if in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and Senator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week\nAnd his media tour which is the second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that\nI I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smeared and treated with a vicious personal in fact\nAll those things I think means that the Susan Collins the world is going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn about who these people are\nHow they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you what thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America\nAnd that you would you promised you would vote on ten specific items in the first hundred days of which you did accomplish that pass and Republican for the most part with a few bumped pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case that if you want results of a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats\nAnd he's been laying up and and you see it and the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening and I think the president is set the stage now to pets and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence sort of like you said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not\nFor silver out of work to them but we're coming back and now we have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be you want us to keep coming back\nKeep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to shave our children from MS Thirteen gangs from central and promote people that are you prepared to be part of a team to one's\nConstitutional judges not radicals I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you\nI think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans can defeat Joe Donnelly and Indiana a a a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill of Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the seat Nevada but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course now that's probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember and you remember 'cause your air two thousand six team two weeks out I Do interviews making Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you're gonna lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nI Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radical Islam I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all their time to destroy Medicare\nThey're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupt in the country and I think that we just have to go out and wage campaign and I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hard working decent American his disgusted but\nWhat they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move a you know for example a\nGovernment run health care means taxpayer abortion well they're very few places in

police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence\nAnd they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes I guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason these public figure a show I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job wanting out the ... year\nUh I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about breaking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence on your have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't discuss I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they're going to regret long term because every\nI I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney Adam paid taxes and then years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... by the means but I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified and whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt\nAnd now it's time to vote now the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and where it's just not going to vote\nThat's right it comes down to the three I mean Mitch McConnell I had been a real warrior and pushing forward look though at a hearing and Grassley not all that and pick up the Democrats you're exactly right it would have been taken to what we can go if we would have had\nLike Holland for how young or San I think he's here that we might not ... ... ... and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrat\nBut because they have political calculation didn't mind you have your mansion looking at it gate or\nThirty percent margin that people are getting out what the un confirmed by three margin people North Dakota once the Kavanaugh confirmed it would be political suicide\nOr hiking or match or don't you're not vote for the nominee don't do that people get their humor lapdog but they might do it out of their own political okay\nWell that's exactly right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less\nCollins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski in like\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their constituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah I mean [laughter] don't\nReal does wrong principle is man that stands on values\nAnd it was a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's conscious of the conservative and it you know if he is then now is a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first adult Jeff Flake Jeff delusion that you are\nDelusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right out of your thank you both for being with us he couldn't get their teen votes I I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state race it off to the northeast New Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and nobody's interested in the guy that doesn't go I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again also every all the vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about what principles were involved in a particular vote\nRight quick a break we'll come back coming up we're Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova as we

them\nWell she's not really sure what happened then you got the whole well they were putting drugs and they were ... girls almost on a weekend basis I went to Penn of these parties myself\nAnd and he's one of the men and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were drug they were gang rape train raped as they were lying in the hall and then that falls into while I saw him near the punch bowl\nAnd and I saw him give red solo cups to people and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top\nAnd the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases\nNo corroboration not the case of professor poured not the case of Mr Ramirez\nAnd not in the case with Julie sweating it know co-op corroboration Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us the gentleman Toensing welcome\nBoth of your back to the program I'm Victoria will start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rapes somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody named that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nUh the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers how they you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them it's kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time and these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California's she's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts is there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz who was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating neck in particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know that is I Know that we have now examined every\nSingle case in every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nYeah well I think um what has happened with Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself a publicity is very very important that ... be investigated by a federal grand jury\nTo act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiated for her story\nThere is most of the education permits Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know uh probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied I was like her lawyers\nDid not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is a lot for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think the Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise now remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist a resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats Deborah cats by the way who said well Paula Jones\nOnly spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken\nBut I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know what should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere's here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are\nFor safety now why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know because we're talking about the we all know\nThat there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now have pushed this so far\nInto a ... ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act to react I Would assume was probably\n... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is non existent shot us than happened that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned them music up so nobody could hear her\nAnd then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys had to just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next\nAnd then your calls coming up final half hour we'll
