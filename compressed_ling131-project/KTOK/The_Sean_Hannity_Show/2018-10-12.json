James O'Keefe is going to join us\nAnd the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there him and his campaign of his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play a few later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all way do we get to the tape on cinema today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but go when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering solutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up\nAll of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy and you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings in fact not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and\nWhen they tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that has created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal it's pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what ... was saying and I'm like why\nDo we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example when the president ... commuted the sentence of ... marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother apparently should running a horrible economic difficulties with like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interviewer I absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her\n[noise] right into the arms of her loving family I got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you thank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the hours free Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that that may be a big given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred Bernie Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago I mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary\n... our our human our human family and talent or being literally you\nKnow are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed\nAnd we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAs white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright\nRacist and disgusting why is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and a noxious vicious viral thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when negroes don't read flat phone\nTurns out to train tiny west and the racial draft now all of a sudden ... because he put on a mat hats and he's an attention more like the president have all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he's he's the token negro of as of the Trump Administration this\nWas an embarrassment on your mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think you had there and man has clearly not OK and a president who's willing to point that\nWas a combination of stream of consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health on the question of other pointing ham I felt very good point and to me I never something very fragile valid and sad about tiny pulling out of the phone and frankly Taipei in his ... side I think for their own piling up somewhere picture of a ... I mean\nJust to expand on that it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on television that I think overall I heard\nA thoughtful play by play and political on out here not ... on our White House\nI'm just going to be honest I may give me a lot of trouble for it I feel actually for bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\n[laughter] this is white supremacy by ring true of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiled\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most and the various practices yet of black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been ... by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and vile I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable to anybody this I don't know Kanye except I talked to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nAnd he is a pack on that vicious horrible level\nI don't even know what to say\nMy friend Heisman Trophy winning football great Herschel Walker he's called out CNN's Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West and\nThe questions is on their behavior and as a guest or a referring to him as quote the oh leave all want to repeat what you just heard\nMy pillow dot com promote Hannity\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the pro check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free to you do it at ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nTotally\nGentle giants dog food Batman I Burt Ward Robin from Batman would you like your dog to live as long as twenty seven healthy active years my wife and I created gentle giants dog\nFood and our special feeding and care programs to help all dogs and puppies live longer healthier lives dogs eating gentle giants are living his longest twenty seven healthy active years twice their normal lifespan now with Wal Mart or ask your local retailer learn more gentle giants dog food dot com\nAnd words well what's new today on the free I our radio a radio\nPerfect for decorating the house or just setting the scary move\nSpicy platelets has killed tracks with labor in my life we've got a project\nEveryone's talking about like the fantasy football or soccer jak Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite stations\nLocal news heard here every day you can use radio one thousand decay deal gay\nAnd [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nRight as we roll on Sean Hannity's show eight hundred dying for one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program so much happening you know I just wonder I think there's something we can factor in here there's actually two things that I that are just known\nWhat the president or the president is going to be in Ohio tonight president spend now traveling the country you know I Love the fact that you know probably political people around the president of\nTelling him well you may not want to get involved in this of Republicans lose they're going to blame you blah blah blah\n[noise] that that's just not how he rose to ... if we if you fight hard and you give something you're all and you don't\nWin at least you can look in the mirror and say you did everything you could do\nBecause there's a lot at stake that's not going to be the end of the world of the Democrats were just going to make every thing harder and more divisive and more difficult and it's going to waste our time and slow or progress I that that's really the truth\nAnd it's important that we keep the momentum are you better off than you or two years ago are you a safer more secure is the economy better off on every measure\nWe know the answer to it but watching Democrats unhinged is pretty amazing All right we've got tapes on yes read as soon as running in ah Tennessee and cinema in Arizona will play those next [noise]\n\nThis is Paul wiser with Keystone construction and excavation if you need small tree or brush removal or to spread sand or gravel or any other material our team was skips the operators can make quick work if you're a small job\nCalled five one for forty seven twenty eight or Keystone construction dot U.

practice and I I really think marshes attitude and a big ... it's okay well I understand you're a liberal well understand you're going to vote for humor that don't don't be ashamed of it it's All right\n[laughter] for it to you really are ... and again I think I think\nIt's just something that I learned this in part from from ... great coverage oh John F. Kennedy and in Queens New York in Nineteen sixty or Kennedy on on those rough the weekend before the election just just ripping the Republicans but it was all funny\nIt was all humorous I mean I think my salary for example to take all of these crazy things that are up on her said weave them together into an eight or ten minutes fish will be like a vaudeville act\nIt's OK\nOkay you'll say in the metro happen\nTo love the of the of the world than and the people\nOf Arizona are crazy I I ... I Can't ... I I think there should be over now\nBut the ... the first thing we should say ... why would you want to be the senator from the capital of the world I mean if you believe the stuff he said why would you want to represent people are crazy what what's wrong with you\nThe gathering life you know and I never really I think I think\nWe should we should accept they really are who they are\nI accept that and I also another thing that the there is no more moderation you know the history of relationships even Tip O'Neill and Reagan I mean those days are long long gone and the era of moderation or a scoop Jackson Democrat or even Joe Lieberman got thrown out of the party Mr Speaker that\nPretty much says it all that was one of the nice as human beings ever\nYou cannot be a moderate Democrat today and survive a and B because it's getting more and more and more isolated I mean I thought it was very telling that the votes on Kavanaugh\nYou have people who might have had a better chance of getting re elected but they couldn't break with their caucus only want to do with their donors only\nOne person and none of that and give them credit Joe mansion job probably won't managing a you know I'm sure he got the help me out of 'em by Chuck Schumer and company\nThey were desperate for him to not vote because they didn't want it to be bipartisan and that's what it is voted\nWell I mean I guess that means he's strong and he's like you're not going to ruin my career because you because of your radical left his agenda maybe it'll even think about becoming a Republican or be wins and that is the one seat that seems Saper red state Democrats the only one now this\nPoint I think that's right I think and and it really even Asia and if you watch the even when he voted for governor the numbers narrow the races closer today than it was a week ago because I think what's happened is people hooked up and suddenly realized what a team sport this is\nThat you got two teams in and there's a really simple question forever so called moderate and I'd say this I Would also says to mention that she was really going to vote for humor\nAffairs question everybody needs to be asked that question that the Democrat\n'cause if it's going to vote for ... why would why would West Virginians send somebody to Washington to take power away from Mitch McConnell in a neighboring state\nMean McConnell least understands West Virginia [noise] humor as contempt for West Virginia has Hillary Clinton has contempt as just recently in two weeks ago you know you add I'm Nancy Pelosi saying things that were contemptible about what's really there's the question I'll be opposed to ...\nAnd I mean just in recent times I mean the the idea of smelly\nWalmart boaters or or we can't be symbol or Joe\nBiden saying and been said and I mean just in recent times I mean the the idea of smelly\nWalmart boaters or or we can't be civil or Joe\nBiden saying in September the ... the ... society\nOr era de mobile deplorable ... or ... or a bitter people\nClinging to their God guns bibles in religion I mean it's pretty obvious where these people are you you haven't had a chance you have to see the bread is an office beat the undercover video project ...

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations have businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations and what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole having a hearing and how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state\nThat you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops and what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is do you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your paltry to raise taxes take what you got to take away the jobs to take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we have holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has a she has the fifty three percent unfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nSo these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play or Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it if she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel\nYet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations\nImpeachment and higher taxes and and you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they're really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of a New York\nI have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing state even as a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I didn't know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat problem is not me and that's it themselves or they're streaming shows\nMe where it is that there are conservatives so he knows that it's not because\nIt's simple no one has Hans within a rifle no one me\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for once me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for it I think my friend John and I can\n... the ... well you disabuse our friend Doug of any notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still am with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state we send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no\nNo income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it Oh yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make should get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice for a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back where the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world\nAre we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next feature she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely thought she should go period style\nAbsolutely and and does point about in previous times or been on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\nWhat should it be should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nOh I think it's got to be harder than that I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years\nIf you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you\nIf you believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in health care plan and the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh I'm are full of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nHuman Services for Veterans Affairs news radio\nOne thousand deal game\nBut as we continue with Doug shown and John McLaughlin are posters just twenty five days from election day um besides running on endless investigation\nAnd impeachment and wanting their crumbs back and wanting to keep Obamacare and wanting to eliminate ice and open borders [noise] can you name one policy that Democrats are running on that would help the American people Doug ...\nMake sure that health care is covered for those with\nPreexisting by the way Donald Trump is saying the same thing\nIt's just the Republican Party has not been a sensitive to the issue as the Democrats but I I got another issue Charlotte\nThey're all saying oh hold on to what Obamacare So\n[noise] well ... to mind when you're thinking what they should say is no below sea no impeachment of cabin or no impeachment of Trump just work on issues like a compromise on immigration compromise on health care and continue choice in education\nNow let me tell you if they if they would listen to that which they never will because they're not a moderate party that would absolutely pretty much wrap it up for the house in my opinion\nI agree Sean were on the same page John do I have your support to work with Sean when we find the state or nation for him to run and for the higher\nGrade we can do your job got a yes or no he could run out and I got to win\nOr not you like your ... your way by the way we're checking out your high school yearbook\nRight now [laughter] I've never looked at us I Know for a good idea what the hell my God\nI Know you're not exactly running for the Supreme Court but if if no check out\nLike that but those are the half of my junior my junior and senior year I was tending bar to four thirty in the morning a lotta night than\nYou know I was just I I didn't show up half the time so that's probably a good thing people don't even recognize that I went there with lots of witnesses yeah I'm sure there as well we'll dig 'em up somewhere from forty years ago uh All right John McLaughlin and a dog show and thank you both for being with us [noise]\n\nReport is sponsored by ...
