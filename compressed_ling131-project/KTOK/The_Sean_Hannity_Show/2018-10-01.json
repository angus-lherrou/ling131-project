corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking it\nThey recall the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed himself and that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring words\nSo that's what the Democrats are said this is a credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them last week 'cause they they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they want to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties herself personally that there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a a whole series of allegations have looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people I mean that's just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge [noise]\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein has this for six long weeks she had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had\nIt early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh and then of course we had the original hearings and not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's\nRadical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week\nOf a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right of professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one email sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart\nAn all girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed ... cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by break cabin on his ... page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA warnings in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit pleased contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted to delay for now if it was truly limited in scope and\nWe know that in the case or professor poured that there were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at the end of the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits they all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event that eye witness has said under penalty of a felony\nThat it never happened\nWhat professor Ford is claiming\nAnd this is professor Ford who put\nMark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond see whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements\n... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody to come out please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and you know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yet who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows\nThen the only thing they've got is well didn't commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking beer a lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to a blackout was an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched that up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous you know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become a crush live or flirtation I saw it all\nI learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he was a pollster was the Clintons poster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for protests afford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning or one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by ... to research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader\nOf the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and

even telling the FBI had to do their jobs and James Comey is suggesting well if you don't talk to the FBI is pretty amazing to me you know just to use his exact words from his op ed refusal\nTo most people will speak to the refusal to do so is its own kind a statement\nOf the problem with that is if you don't remember something perfectly\nWith the FBI and you're talking to them it's a crime it's a felony and if you don't believe me asked General Flynn and if you don't believe me asked Papadopoulos who faced five\nYears in jail [noise] you know the idea that you know the FBI back in the middle of it you know you're screwed that's what\nYou know when I was handed the Clinton email investigation the deputy director said to me you know you're totally screwed right well maybe you shouldn't have been writing in may before you interviewed Clinton and before you interviewed any of the other Seventeen witnesses maybe\nMaybe you shouldn't have been writing the exoneration before the

if that's not obstruction of justice I don't know what is and then lying about top secret classified special access programming information\nIn a mom and pop shop bathroom closet for the very purpose of avoiding congressional oversight it's the kind of a slam dunk case\nAnd anyway he goes on to but we live in a world where the president routinely attacks the FBI because he fears it's work no\nHe

Pat Buchanan and breathing in all those original guys there there was an amazing show at its time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those shows are doing the things that people want a month now but\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation a number one for so where conservatives we have a moral up us if we if we do detect but there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats they're dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power to investigate everything that's going on here and potentially witness was being coaxed ally\nPeople being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the problem is we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't look if we're going to be fair if they

I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to believe that any of these people um it it can take themselves seriously they said\nGoing to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she works at the ... every Democrat that it's now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be this horrible partisan organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLife long reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever he'll you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets ... and many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their excuse is counted but this couch them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they spoke to fourteen different times they've found now they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him\nI don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a hat but but it\nYou know the parents to do on a reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely sunny\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habits are very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass on the call me and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the ... the FBI people I Know the whole to the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement\nWithout a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says if you look in his company's coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and this is just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their ... with their debts get it it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing 'cause the FBI ... and ... is how much they can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they couldn't be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nBy announcing that morality IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on against the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link to one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here\nIf she's asking other if she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is eating right and it's you know\nRight before this whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even still share it with him she said what positive it in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain it hit as him so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or because they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I'm I'm a tractor even counted as a credible allegations of the you know what\nFor the FBI could talk to her\nThey'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly getting hold of wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been
