okay Oklahoma's first new [noise]\nEverything you get is predictable Democratic Party one oh one mere slander ... blood thinning whoever they don't like and don't agree with it you know the new it is there one and only play book\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program\nBut the stakes couldn't be higher\nFor weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better\nOr they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago is America stronger than it was two years ago if the economy better off than it was two years ago\nIs the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt built today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now have record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world that won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to presidents kept\nHis promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea the sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards\nTo that President has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipeline nor the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put two originalist on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days or weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gonna now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a head of the investigation and the next\nOr you know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know that just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with the cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration of Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remembered then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nOr by the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group\nThat they went out and hire the former and my six agent or the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August tore and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI now gone twenty five top representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside\nAnyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's done in terms of what it reveals since that directly contradicts Justice Department an FBI officials sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out it was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in effect you know its application then for the Pfizer warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nMuch by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes us he was on with Maria ... I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the Pfizer warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without Hillary's embalming here they wouldn't have been a ... an application to spy on the Trump campaign they wouldn't be fusion GPS or a dusty a on Trump we wouldn't be living through his second year of\nEndless Trump Russia investigation with no evidence whatsoever because Democrats cynically launched the whole thing to ruin Donald Trump's presidency and set 'em up for impeachment\nDot com and download I hard Radio Free [noise]\nThough the bigger bombshell to come out of again we were busy last week with the cabinet issue but the bigger bomb that come out of the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment anyway it turns out\nThat not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicled by both\nThe deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page that's Peters trucks boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry\nLisa Page was it was she was his boy\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump after Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out\nWord through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it the thing that struck me the\nMost was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source close to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nYou know Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\nHey this is Paul wiser with Keystone construction an exclamation did you know that for only a hundred dollars you can have up to eight hours a bulldozer work done on your property and that includes transport complete year project for much less than you'd think called five one for forty seven twenty eight or Keystone construction dot U.

top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit landed a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined for Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle of thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area with chicken with both job of started the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle\nIt was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cake if they're in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category three perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look to the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nAnd it's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into pattern in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency\nIt's maps came out and said look out October fifth through about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely\nHey say well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to camp I owe or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto we hit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's heading\nIt's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between K Patterson Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but\nIt is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there\nWhere we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nThat is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nAlso locking down it's all good for the American people\nI don't know why people you know there are different people different styles and life like lenders very combative and drops the F bomb a lot\nOn this does not doesn't do it on the program because we have a dump button and when she does we just

O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he ... quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid and the FBI lawyer that\nWas assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI remember then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs this five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as just in that timeframe around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements throw spokes person is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions\nUnder the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates an already complicated picture as it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress\nAssuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together but there's what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon member twenty five people have either been demoted fired or

fourth financial advisor warrant\nIn other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to see color it secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the ... say something that they could use and then both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set at Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe as a pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact it was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS in our research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dusty a that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used when our understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who've die by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenties sixteenth election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton at the FBI knew he was a go between and this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jarrett continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong right Jared\nGot a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document based on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now\nA second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along computer storage data\nAs well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer the God Forbid I got a bad accident right\nRight um you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility at Seventy in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or is it to emerge and see you know a lot of the tree and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck ah docks where patient care bound Asian you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seem to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in back of the table to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like ... what some here in southwest Florida a practice health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create ... ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it wrong\nAnd you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots one ensuring if using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to get it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\nI'm an ... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nThat real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this exact topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody\nWhether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send him an originality\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it so you what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nAnd if I could add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal\nOr so something little stretching just brought by ... get access to these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses for Seventy five dollars a month or\nSo but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... denied them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody is priced at the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over then to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that costs that would be an amazing model it it would cut down\nThere right let's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden\nSo we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can\nWrite a quick break we'll come back more Dr Josh ... some day and Dr Lee as grows president ah docks for a patient care foundation
