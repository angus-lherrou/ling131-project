P. Morgan because in the depression they brought in J. P. Morgan I mean he was brought before Congress and then it was like okay we grilled him now\nShaky can you help us out here and he did he helped out in the depression\nJamie diamond did the same thing with the financial crisis they call you know he was like the head of this ring of private bankers\nBut you know not losing a client was critical but I'm going back and reminding clients how proud they should be of themselves because I just helped him through it makes their decision\nAnd I said right or wrong if you say go to cash with the stroke of a pin we can do that in our office with the stroke of a pin\nSo you know people knowing that that is something that they can do they have confidence in that we have had the best partners\nThe partners we have like one of them in particular they have Ninety eight percent retention rate ... that's just unheard of in our industry so when we get a client though and we agreed to be partners with them because we look at it for life\nBut nobody can change my opinion and if people don't fit our model and don't get it that's perfectly okay with me because I can sleep well at night I don't have to worry about you're doing something stupid [laughter] you know I don't want we we just don't have clients like that in in our in our family\nSo I Would tell people to make sure yet that second opinion do to be sure that you don't have a hole in your portfolio because the storm is coming you know\nYou need to get the flashlights you need to get the water you need to have a safe place to go you need a plan especially getting close to retirement because we saw so many people that\nCouldn't retire none of our clients everybody went on vacation nobody had to take money out of their accounts nobody because we had plenty of cash so you didn't have to take money out of your investments when they were going in the tank right until they recovered\nOur clients we did everything we could with Congress to be sure that our MDs were frozen that didn't work until February but they finally figured it out yeah [noise]\nWell you know we have seen unprecedented growth in the intervening years since the financial crisis or you know there's always a dangerous good when we see that kind of growth that people started to agree to you again I Know where they're ... they go Gordon Gekko greed is good you know in your opinion\nAnd the ten years since the financial crisis how we learn from our past mistakes\nKnow want to know for a while so well because what happens is is that people forget just like the old booms every ... the real estate been people forget you got to remember now we've got a whole new generation that didn't suffer them so they\nDon't want her to their parents or other people talk about\nJust like the depression but you know our clients have and and I love the fact that like we had people come in last week and said our kids are going to have their house paid off and you know Fifteen Years and\nInstead of thirty are longer so these these that generation the parents that have really taught their kids that really got hurt and they teach their kids properly that you know\nTo what grandma said say for a rainy day because the rain is going to come we need the umbrella we need the glasses and if we need the rank up\nYou need to be prepared so if you take he did that and don't just think it's like a wonderful that we can turn it on and it's just going to run for ever know because when it shuts off just like Jim with financial lineage shut off they they acted like the world is coming to an end because their mortgage company will they oh they're hiring firing four hundred people\nBecause there's nobody getting what they did that twenty seven thousand people\nLost jobs twenty seven million people really so yeah\nSo the bottom line is um don't don't get greedy you know you you\n... and ... that's exactly right you need to have a plan and it doesn't have to be you don't it's not a plan\nThat is you know pay by the pound it doesn't need to be a five hundred page plan\nIt could be as simple as one page of the shows your goal buckets ran my cash this year my guaranteed protected money is here my investments are here and that's what we do hear a ... because what we know that the reason you listen to the show and probably other financial shows is that you know retiring well as an easy\nAnd you're not quite sure exactly where to turn to what to do\nAnd when we get it sometimes you think about all this advice just sounds the same well there's a reason for that we all have the same stock market you can go talk to fifty different advisers and you may hear the same types of things maybe some things are different\nWe know what you're really looking for being trustworthy giving you advice on your investments and Social Security and taxes that's just the price of admission that's just what we do All right\nThe other stuff that you're looking for those someone to hold your

how important they are and to help us a good grasp on that and actually get you some tools that you can use because sometimes you think you know I'm not really up on all of that joining us right now is mark ... Olivier from the national Shooting Sports foundation hey mark welcome\nTom thanks for having me appreciate your getting a sometimes talk or these lectures are to gun owners\nAbsolutely 'cause you know and I talk to people say yeah you know I really need to do that but I'm not\nSure where to vote or I'm not sure where my candidate is on this prime not sure well that's kind of what the whole gun vote things about isn't it\n[noise] it is so and it's a staff or several years ago ... vote a program so if they go to ... dot org it will take you to a Web page where you can type in you know where you live and it will tell you who your candidates are and where they stand on the gun issue and and just like it was a few years ago in the presidential election\nThis mid term elections going to be crucial as to as to what stands for rice you know who's going to be protecting our eyes\nAnd what we can expect out of the next couple of years so when it comes to the fires policy in America\nIt's interesting he said 'cause it's fires policy I'm not sure people say well you know I Know yeah we want to win\nAnd I want to stop and say well let me explain to you what this means because right now the Republicans control the house and the Senate and the White House\nWhen the Democrats get control of the house for instance they can control what bills are introduced they can control what bills are voted on if the Democrats control the Senate of course they get control of the confirmation process on Supreme Court justice as we've just seen that battle there\nAnd of course the Democrats also announced that if you control the house they're going to try to impeach a President Trump and also they're going to try to impeach our Brett Kavanaugh chief justice now most Supreme Court\nThey can only do those things if they are in the majority of each else am I right\nYou're absolutely right and that's how I Am so we have control of both the house and Senate\nFor those for those politicians from our elected leaders who are listening to their gun owners are voting for them then they're going to make sure that these these pointless investigations these pointless hearings on our body down to Congress in getting out according to a policy issues pushed forward in pushing back the ones that\nAre truly going to be detrimental to us on our ability to exercise our ...\nYou know and are just so people understand what we're talking about we're talking about the everybody says well we need a national reciprocity you're not going to get that with Democrats in control of the house on the Senate you know we want a the hearing Protection Act you're not going to get that\nWith the Democrat Party in charge of the house and Senate it's not going to happen to physically a logically impossible to get those but what you are going to get a lot of efforts at more restrictive gun control laws which means stripping away or infringing on your rights\nYou're you're actually right now so I looked at it a national character ... have been introduced in the last Congress\nBut still pending out there the hearing Protection Act as as a builder still pending out there are and joy so overwhelming support but because of the difficulty in the math and the Senate because it only takes one senator filibuster hold those bills up\nWe haven't been able to those two issues for which we know are crucial issues to fire soldiers in America today they want to see these things pass they want to see them for the OJ exercise their rights without any kind of impediment so\nEven when we're talking about having control these houses are still poor that we have a majority to be able to do this we need sixty senators to filibuster proof to be able to move things is true in right now we have a razor thin margin ... so we really need to make sure that\nThey are voters out there are educated as to where the Kennedys stamp they know where the issues are and they can go find that at a at gun poke out of work\nYou know market occurs to me also one of the things or incest F works on a lot of things that people don't know about their important but they're kind of\nHidden not secret exactly but they're just not on the radar things like and this would be important or in the upcoming election things like the efforts to use the EPA to try to be an entire classifications of ammunition because they contain let\nShore yeah it it's not just that the federal level wishing that the state level as well so\nOur folks that are working washed issue you're meeting with their legislators everyday that meeting with both the house in the Senate\nThey're both eating would let Republican or Democrat then they're they're trying to make sure they understand what the what the unintended consequences of these bills could be so they start to band lead ammunition traditionally mission and they say you can't use that for hunting it\nWorse so bad and I was like I did the exact same thing that Rob did and we were reading bodybuilding magazines and we're like okay this is what Arnold\nDid muscle is fantasy league only fitness is ... this is what Mr\nAnd we were ... you know and I started to realize why is it not working for me what's working for Rob and I'll tell you why it's because we're all different yeah these days people are like\nMy best friend is doing the paleo diet and sent working for me my best friends if he can but it's not working for me ... have you figured out what your best\nThing ... and is it different at forty whatever then it was at Eighteen I mean your your best self your best diet your best training have you figured out what's individually best for you\nI think it's constantly changing us as we develop and you know what's interesting coming back to that even at Fifteen sixteen year years old guy you were\nAbsolutely eat up in a neighborhood with health and fitness you are doing what you were born to do you saw ... pieces of that and the very beginning and you always where I went to you for information I may have had the gun and I went to file for information\nOut already now and you know it's interesting because we're going to do this a lot Rob you're going to come on the show if if you're cool with that what you just keyed in on is something that's super important and that is a bigger part of the health story which is a beyond physical\nIt's mental emotional it's it's doing what you're built to do it's doing what you're born to do finding that\nFinding that man and and ah\nI honestly I think that that's what you do you have a sign company I Do called\nThe signs and so you go around the city you guys and you go to a restaurant you go to a gas station you go to these different places and there's always a big sign up there there is a good chance that robs company made that site that's what you've done for a lotta years forever I'm standing on top of that thing\nThat is what was it's funny because I'm the same way with you I could see it back when we were teenagers I Will take you back\nTo uh the era where there was a band called in excess\nUh in the eighties we loved him love ethical wanted to Michael ... and so you walked in one day with the Jean jacket on the back and had this in excess thing and it had this guy that kind of look like and it was it a drawing was patch I don't know what it was\nAnd I said where did you get that these\nLike I didn't get any where I made it so guy and he had this art history but he wasn't like one of those artist who's drawing mythical dragon stuff it was cool stuff right okay I think that's cool but\nI had it and I had it in a nerdy\nI don't care about lord of the rings drawings I care about what you did and fast forward to in your forties and this is what you've been doing was it hard to figure out this has everything to do with health was it hard to figure out\nWhat past you were going to take or was it a natural thing once you found that this is a thing that you can apply your artistry and your love of entrepreneur ship all into one place how would how did that happen\nI think those seeds were all always there I think I don't I think the scientists found me was I was able to express myself that I Love and I think if we look into our lives we can see those seeds and all we have to do is develop you're doing what you were made to do so and I mean you guys are doing what you're right to do\nSo talk about then there are a lot of people listening right now and they're not doing what they're made to do they chased the dollar they chased what their parents expectations were they chased whatever or they missed out on chasing that they think I'm they wanted to do it but\nThere are so many people I talked to and their health is a rack\nAnd you know I did and what I've done that where I got out of things and chase money Mm and and I was successful at it but my health\nSuffered you know what I'm Talking about in my thirties I was highly successful but yeah and he was coming I hated into spies what I did wow I didn't want to go to bed at night because I didn't want to wake up the next morning to do what I had to do all over again even with success in my health was declining\nMy exact words was I'll be dead before I'm forty you said I said that and I would have been my gosh\nWhy Rob mentioned something in the first segment and man we cannot breeze over it because when he said it it just it for me because it's been my journey over the last Twenty years\nHe talked about just stepping in the cage was okay he he went from an event lifestyle\nIn his mentality and shifted that too I can enjoy the process each day I can look forward to each day as it unfolds\nRather than saying when I Do that when I get there in the cage and win that fight then then there's nothing left to live for after that you don't learn how to smell the roses and I'm like oh I Would love for him to address that because he just kind of breezed over that and that's like that's a big deal\nWell and I've done that I've lived that life in those moments of what we call successor victory are tiny they're fragments ... they're a piece of sand on the beach and you better enjoy the beach not an ISIS saying\nOn it you better enjoy your life is\nThat is the truth Rob seriously um this is the kind of thing that uh people of of whatever gender whatever your background what it doesn't matter\nI when I talk to people or I used to do nutrition counseling and I can't believe how many times that the\n... there was symptoms that were physical but the problem was not physical the problem was something with a how their life was going at how they perceive live how they dealt with pressure how they dealt with anxiety\nDisappointment all of these things go into it\nAnd it is a lot of people really are looking for the belt the victory that tiny little moment and I talked to somebody just last night big league\n[noise] money guy and he's like where's the joy man [noise] I I Can't find it I said I I this was what I work half my life or and I haven't got someone telling you as a man thanks in his heart so easy and male moment sinks

conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One phrase genetic bumps\n[laughter] [noise] so today we've been discussing\nWhy most people don't become successful and that is because they really believe in the back of their heart\nThat back of their mind and there are that workers the secret to becoming wealthy that if you have the right job you get the right education you have the right job you're going to get rich\nWhen none of that is true and it some people take them till they're thirty to figure that out and have their midlife crisis some it's forty so much fifty\nSo much one job two jobs three jobs for they finally figure it out but when you tell them there's a way to go out there and make millions they can't believe that you could actually mean that because in their mind they live with the type of mentality that's called a lack mentality\nThey believe in the zero sum game of this\nThe world's way the Democrats believe Democrats believe that for a sector of our society to have more money they have to steal it from another sector now think about that what is taxation there's nothing fair about taxation a man or woman goes out and producers\nAnd should they lose what they produce well let's take a poor guy should I come to a poor crop sheer crop uh sharecroppers farm away from him or shake his income away from it you wouldn't think of taking and come away from a poor parts of why would you think you're taking in come away from a rich person or a middle class person for that matter\nWhat is it in our society that makes fifty one percent of the people out there believed that you have to steal from another man to put money in your pocket\nAnd that whole society politically believes that that old society morale more moral Lee believes that right and then they wonder why they're broke now the other end of the world the other opposite end is that people have the abundance mentality\nAnd the abundance mentality says I Believe there's enough for all of us and I'm just going to go ahead and produce a lot\nAnd then the more I produce the more the risk for every body yeah and even when you tax me I'm Still going to try to produce even though I don't think it's fair I still believe in abundance I Believe in production\nAnd that's what's gonna happen now that Trump has been elected in you're going to see it as the world's going to believe in abundance again and the country's going to prosper right and you're going to the middle class and rich people get rich again\nAnd you see the people that have the lack mentality remain poor\nAnd they're never going to be anything but poor because of the way they see the world how you see the world is the problem is I ... I'm Stein said\nIt's not what is the problem is how you see the problem that is the real problem and if these lack mentality of people would ever get out of their lack mentality and get out and get some abundance mentality they could change their own lives but they won't let me read the rest of the email\nIt says I Am sure if you are not teaching real estate and kept this info to your inner circle of friends and family there would be amazing deals for you just sitting and waiting for you to snatch them up so it's no one would be aware of what\nThey're passing up you say that real estate pies big enough for everyone but it's not the whole world is confident and educated enough to spot great deals [noise]\nNo it's not if everybody can spot the great deals what he's saying no you're absolutely wrong\nFirst of all the deals that we do it lifestyles many of them could not have been done most of them could not have been done if they weren't done his partnerships\nSo if it wasn't for a group of people being educated like mindedly\nTo are they all understand the investment in a business they're not working in the business is not a job they're investing in a business that is an ongoing concern\nThat has a product that's pretty hard to al data itself because think about it for just a second whether they're going to invent a way for us to vaporize ourselves to go to bed at night and sleep we have to have a place delay our head down at night to eat our dinners et cetera et cetera\nSo until they have vaporize Asian we have housing that when the vapors Asian guess what I'm going to invest in vapors Asian\nRight but until then housing has been around forever and probably will be around for a lot longer okay so here it is the guy saying do you could steal all the deals no I couldn't do all the deals because if I didn't have a group of like minded people we wouldn't have enough money to go out and do all the deals\nNow the next point he's making is once we teach all these people all over the world how to do this there is not going to be enough deals now here's a reality I've been doing this in Houston, Texas for Thirty years\nAnd we're still doing deals at a higher rate than we've ever done a map before\nSo that part is why\nWe went to Dallas we've been doing it there for Fifteen Years still doing deals at a faster rate than ever before San Antonio Austin the same thing but now you have to understand is for twenty six years in Houston I've had lifestyles\nWe still haven't even touched the market we put a dent in the microwave scratch the edge of the market\nBecause there's so many apartment complexes there's like three thousand apartment complexes in years to three thousand in Dallas three thousand San Antonio and Austin and that's only just taxes that's not counting middling not counting the nine we own down in Corpus Christi\nEt cetera et cetera so here's a point when we expand to a new area like Atlanta where we're going\nThat whole city has Thirty Years' worth prospect of action for us\nWe haven't even begun it just like when they told us when we were high school when I was in high school the stupid idiots told us there was Twenty years of oil\nLeft Twenty years and that's it will be out of oil that's the lack mentality now there's a hundred years of oil left in each of about five countries out there right in each of five and in fact there's probably a hundred years while in two or three states in this country just one state\nAnd yet we still believe we have an oil now\nWe believe that there's so many apartment complexes that if we signed up as many people as we have in taxes\nIn every other state union they're still being a business from to do that and that will be Ken lifetimes before that happens but my point is is with all of that said where they're being true to disguise totally miss the mark with his email\nMy point you is how sad is it for him\nBecause here is now thirty six years of age and here's what he believes it seems like the only secure jobs for those who are not already rich are the ones that take many years of sacrifice and credentials such as being a doctor or lawyer which is something not everyone is willing to do about the demand\nWill always be high there it is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "13"}
