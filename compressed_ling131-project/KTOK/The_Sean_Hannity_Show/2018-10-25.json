know I listen to Hillary yesterday\nCompared to what you said a week ago I listen to you know Andrew Cuomo worst governor of New York history say conservatives he they're not New Yorkers they don't belong here I had every other governor in the country inviting me to move there which would be the smartest thing I could do because I wouldn't pay as much in taxes\nAnd and now you have to say no e pluribus owned them and I'm like you're so full of crap\nThey listen to what I saw yesterday you know them trying to put the blame on the president's than making these choices are as you know Sean last night I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck\nBranded in the middle of our broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought it was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be a and then he got on for a ten minute blast of the president\nI just think it's bizarre I'd say ... way over the top I said\nThey're going to get laid when that happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining and detailed and you left in they'd send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they interrupted and said that running was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this ten minute tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chase me down the block trying to get me to come back we're calling me\nBut you know what an office enough already ... listen this is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh\nThis is not a time for division\nAnd CNN and granted we're at the max dividing uh ... the audience that was watching the show\nThere is no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka ... nobody ever it's not being conservatives that have been you know saying things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House um it's been Hollywood wants to punch the president in the face and showing ... heads of the president and\nThose that talked about killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives in you know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife ... you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here it's I've been saying for weeks now going\nBack to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress somebody's going to get hurt somebody's going to get killed and lo and behold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up and then those people that were silent when it's a Republican\nNow or oh this is outrageous we can't have this kind of rhetoric and this is this is horrible he can't say fake news they are fake news\nThough they are and we need to keep using that phrase and NATO allies to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a cabin or moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the left who it is CNN anybody tell me which Republican which member of either the media\nAll the political leadership made political profit\nFrom Bernie solve is willing to shooting Steve Steve ... which Republican member of the the pop the all the media profit to\nPersonally profited by his side of the rice and off the white powder was mailed to the Trump family members of the cabinet off the individuals were\nThat happened three weeks ago President Trump FBI Director re a defense secretary Mattis and and the CIA director how all all had rice and mailed to them by the way I've had white powder mail to ...\nA ... over the years I mean it's a horrible thing that anybody has to go through we all want to catch him several responsible here are but whoever it is is not somebody that would be that we would know as a quote conservative and it's just some nut job or some lunatic on what it doesn't matter what their politics are\nWhy why is it OK why is it okay for CNN to Ron tyrants today blaming\nDonald Trump for not taking responsibility for these attempted letter bombs why is that okay when one Republican profit from congressmen actually getting shot that at a baseball field very close to where I Am studying about by left wing activist\nThis is this is the double standards that the average American see through and this is why we're going to vote down ticket Republicans on November to six because they had enough of the lives of the double standards\nKnow it's the same thing burning and I agree with

elections\nYou know it had been and even I have flown into this even though I tell you don't fall into this I had been reading the polls and I kept seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for cabinet which was a good boat with the right thing to do um but with that had um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback\nI'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people\nDrilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business and it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy is the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would've never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened to the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell ya I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policy that West Virginians really appreciate that so that's one of the president's comment very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when they count so you know I don't like to count on naming of post

Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and uh uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore\nIt was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks to have a ... a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being in plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races then the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have and by the way preexisting conditions of big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions\nIs going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh ember atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month the unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack a cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge charity ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been a vacation\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like we need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website ... dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives\nYou know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote don't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida real little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on and about\nA we definitely need Martha ... Sally war hero against this radical Christ in ... now no problems with Americans joining\nJihad to use and and joining the Taliban and then of course we've got Montana tests or has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nA and Joe Donnelly his case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their vote on the libertarian candidate in Indiana or else that's going to be a problem Bob Menendez can be beaten in New Jersey he's only up three\nBob Menendez could be the big surprise of the night second big surprise of the night as Joe Manchin losing in West Virginia you know this state uh most worried about to be very honest to Florida\nBecause this guy Gillum is a radical socialist leftist if elected governor is going to ruin this great state\nAnd you're going to see all the prosperity and all the money that has been flowing into Florida\nStart dissipating almost immediately and you're

Republicans on these mobs and most of the Democrats have been silent\nWell you're right they only skillet things which a double standard and it doesn't matter what the issue is whether it's something

about the weather or whether they're Republican due to argue with them in the face\nOf the press always ask for more showers debate you know I was in high school like if they can be on the gym\nYou know when they go low [laughter] may go low we rent was different radical ideas about how\nThey go low we can't go doesn't marijuana punch him in the face I think an awful lot about blowing up the
