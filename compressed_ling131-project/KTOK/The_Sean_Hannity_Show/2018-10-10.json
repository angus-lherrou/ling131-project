if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect to that point it's probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this was a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge these destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher\n... over a million power outages we expect occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so uh everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make your preparation now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in in harm's way today this is this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends and Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me\nHe is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nPhony Russian dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense\nHe was now are supposed to testify but those three people now\nLisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse\nS. and M. passes over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McCain Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about what was in regards to ... warns that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity the truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the five applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us da was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump\nOr in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton well nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant and protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate because obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said\nWell first it gets to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... operation of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there is no there are there but anyway then they started ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nA Judiciary Committee ... sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why ...\nEspecially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out

Radio Free\nWe're all on Sean Hannity's show eight hundred nine four one Sean good news\nPolling operation rats musing\nA by the way they had the best accuracy record in twenty sixteen in the presidential election when so many others were wrong now saying that Republicans are tied with Democrats on the twenty Eighteen generic ballot latest raspy recent survey forty five percent of likely voters would choose a democratic candidate of the elections for Congress were held today\nAnother forty five percent off for the Republicans three percent prefer another candidate\nThat side of five point recent improvement for the G O P but if you go back at this time in twenty fourteen prior to the last non presidential\nA year congressional election Democrats at a forty one thirty nine lead but Republicans went on to win nine Senate seats and increase their majority in the house\nWhat that means if I can interpret for you it means that in twenty seven days we the people have the opportunity to shock the world again\nAnd not real war the outrageous behavior of the entire Democratic Party establishment in the last two years and and more recently with judge Kavanaugh\nAnd by the way another sign that Chuck Schumer is antique Kavanaugh strategy was a public relations disaster another poll finds raspy isn't that\nRepublicans are more angry about the cabinet controversy the Democrats are more determined to vote in the upcoming election because of it new recipes some poll shows that sixty two percent of Republicans are more likely to vote because of what the Democrats did\nThe judge Kavanaugh compared to fifty four percent of Democrats or that is a good sign for twenty seven days and on top of that Democrats keep Everytime they open their mouth and they expose what they're real agenda is its investigation it's impeachment it's take their crumbs back and eliminate the\nThe tax cuts that have been helping the economy so much and of course they want to keep Obamacare and actually quote strengthen it in other words make it worse and\nOn top of all of that eliminating ice and open borders has a lot at stake\nI when we come back a category of for hurricane

show one time and your hand and ties Sean Hannity is back on the radio [noise] probably twenty five now till\nThe top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program as we speak\nWe have a category for borderline really category five hurricane now slamming the panhandle of Florida Panama City exactly where we told you it was going to hit we have gust of a hundred and Seventy five eighty miles per hour storm surge up to thirty feet\nAre and the center is hitting hard and furious and fast just as Joe ... a predicted since Sunday and his forecast in on this program yesterday and he joins us now from whether bell dot com the official meteorologist at the Sean Hannity show um everything you said and more um cat\nFor maybe borderline cat five\nYeah landfall now it's it's inland now thirty to forty miles and we want to give you said at the track of this is going to be very a right to middle Georgia or live very close to making Warner robins about two am this morning near Augusta tomorrow morning and near and south and the track for instance it looks like wind gusts\nAre going to be to a hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour in southwest Georgia\nProbably uh Seventy five a hundred miles an hour middle Georgia around the Augusta area the strongest winds are probably going to be between a sixty and eighty miles an hour near and southeast of Augusta\nAnd in Columbia say fifty five Seventy five year in southeast of there so the track of this by tomorrow night\nUh will take it or to take it probably a north the Fayetteville North Carolina and then two AM in the morning it reaches the or reaches a lizard at city North Carolina and then it goes out\nSo that's how we're expecting this to move or over the next twenty four to thirty six hours and so it's going to be moving pretty quickly or through a lot of these areas\nLet me go through this a little bit more first of all I mean the the governor saying I Hope to God that nobody said that ... people evacuated on the coast I'm not so sure that that's the case I mean I'm looking at some of these images and it's it's downright scary flooding has already occurred in in some of these coastal areas\nUm but the the these are the types of wins that could blow down houses correct and and structure\nI suspect you're not seeing any any uh video coming in from where this made landfall ... I mean it's one thing for instance the Pensacola is on the west side of this mobile Pensacola has had a wins out the north forty ... sixty but it's blowing out\nSo it's at Panama City area a port saint Joe that's the area where it's ground zero and that you know if you told me structures and I'm not just talking about the you know a small structure I'm Talking about a year Camille took apartment buildings out along the beach show\nEither saying this storm Joe is the most powerful on record to ever hit the Florida Panhandle\nRight between mobile and Tampa this is the most part on record as young as ...\nAlso goes ... Camille once you get ... you get Camille in their ... and those places that are Camille as a benchmark store in there and done and Charlie down south of Tampa or the benchmark storms here of course Andrew in Miami\nOr they're Nineteen twenty six was a bad storm along the coast but it was only a category three\nUp near Pensacola now this is this is the ... the worst storm now when we get a lot of folks to the east of the tracks severe weather tornadoes are going to break out well tonight into tomorrow and we're talking on southern and eastern\nWhen you weigh on the east of the ... you're talking now about the Georgia but it's going to be a little south of Atlanta a direct kind of hit a ... a hundred miles an hour I'm guessing into Augusta\nWell no I think I think Augustus is sixty to eighty maybe Ninety miles now they'll back off by making making like I said it may get gusts as high as that\nSouthwest Georgia where it's going to be entering into a couple of hours they're going to be seen was a hundred hundred and twenty miles an hour and ... and there I mean that that's phenomenal because you've got to understand folks as powerful as these things are when they get inland fractional effects\nOr it's almost like if you if you're running a nine one a sprint nine one one hundred yard dash if you tweak your hamstring if you can't run that fast if you really pull it you can't run at all well these things have perfect machines\nBut once they get in the ... affects the fact that they're moving away from the source of energy the water they ... they wind down but we're talking about a relative windy got how many times as a dust that George you get when sit near hurricane force from\nA storm that hit all the way down or close to ... miles or two hundred and fifty miles to the south west but the torn addict activity yeah make sure we cover for that eastern eastern Georgia eastern South Carolina eastern North Carolina\nDrop and said the answer is yes and as his time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abuse within the ... system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant the information you gathered in foreign database is not\nConstitutional and the sense that had gathered with no bar there is no war it there's no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it on a domestic crime\nThat has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought it was a great idea\nNever having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the de OJ\nThat would literally be weaponized sing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people\nAnd I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate him put together a flimsy dusty a with Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer Warren application but not one for\nThe original application in three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate and that it was never verified a corroborated but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it bites wearing you know we'll get into this you know with chairman Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that\nThis is what we do we have a constitution for a reason there's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have to present credible evidence to a court to get a warrant the bar is even higher when it comes to a Pfizer surveillance warrant\nAnd what has happened here is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal ever\nNow we've got three people on record saying that Rod Rosenstein well yeah the plan hatched to surreptitiously record the president the hopes that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and he won't even testify under oath to know Congress's letting we got to let him get away with that Trey Gowdy is going to let them get away with that\nBob Goodlatte is going to let them get away with that and we were a lot\nTo get to Newt Gingrich when we get back we'll have more on hurricane Michael\nChairman meadows or the Freedom Caucus Jim Jordan are coming up and got a lot to get through today I Want to remind you you know speaking of hackers

applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize what a five ... five ... actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if this wrong sometimes it is if you find out anything incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in there that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed ... David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal buys the application and the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked\nWhich is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also of Freedom Caucus member a end by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think you're saying is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath\nAnd want to talk about your whole security protecting your family that simply said

and\n\nWe can\nCongressman Jim Jordan and congressman mark\nMeadows All right so the next step then is what I mean do we do I need to give out the numbers of Trey Gowdy is office and chairman good last office and say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing up with a third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number ... holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nUh to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular buys her application\nI have not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time Bruce or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact ... percent yup yup and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve of those\nSo the so called real too is when you see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying well we'll ask him to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe page all those documents as well\nThat would include my number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that transparency give us the information that we need to see it more important the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please do oh two two to five six oh three oh a chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five\nFifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but\nI think with all that's going on and they should demand that he testify under oath a thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your push for the truth we need to get to the bottom of the [noise]\nAll right we've got to take a break when we come back we got a lot more to come dam bond Gino Greg jar

rich Dennison [noise]\nA welcome both of you to the program um you you watch the tactics you see the polls for the first time raspy used in showing that Republicans have more enthusiasm the Democrats in the lead up to the mid term elections I think the Kavanaugh hearings says awoken\nPeople to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I listen to the old tactics to the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics can easily Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president in the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen to them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a NASA mode of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim you\nReally can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of issues on fear now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnish state just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no\nReasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLooked the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want war Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage or not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the uh treat treat guilty of treason a crime and literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he'd been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this ... this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and cabinet if you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and then teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to run the accomplishments of Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\nBrock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity\n'em and add you know money to their wallets into private or from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall a the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars he needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big\nIssues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he couldn't make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nNear future ... and don't forget showing that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell your most of these cases that are ... importance to American businesses American individuals' moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court\nAnd Trump already has was uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts\nAnd there's a couple of more are getting ready to to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat or you know that that could come open if Trump wins reelection it may come open I ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually\nWorried what will happen to the country if that seat if Ginsburg decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed would cabinet can you imagine what's going to happen\nIf that seat comes open and it's a potential six three conservative majority on the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen I quit\nArrest cancellation and more oh for a fixed fee Travis walking with offices here in Oklahoma City in Norman call for zero five six zero seven eleven Ninety two for

the issues are before them\nAnd that is the latest one that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker of all said that that Rod Rosenstein or talked about surreptitiously taping the president\nOf the United states in the hopes of getting something on tape but that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThose are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James call me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have on redacted in released the American people that hasn't happened yet

Hannity is on right now\nBut fortunately this is a working guy because all of the moment so stay with her to come into play so the storm surge estimates are anywhere between nine and fourteen the\nStorm surge is going to be the worst where the slant on just to the east or south where the landfall\nSomewhere right now between Panama City that was going to push forward so not only is he going to reinforce the devotion water one of the nation there'll be wave action on top of that which is the primary driver of why we evacuated\nAnd then a couple of that you've got over a hundred and forty five miles per hour winds um you know just before two thousand and one of them are not designed to handle that wins\nAnd it's going to unfortunately pushed through the state so we're asking us citizens in southwest Georgia southern orange to be vigilant and make sure that they understand\nWhat about this area is going to see a cat one\nStorm as it moves in hand with the vegetation there while we're anticipating is a lot of down trees are impacting the power in and uh you know here again we're going to see a lot of damage devastation along the coast structurally and then as it moves and you're gonna see power outages throughout the state\nThat was Brock Long FEMA administrator I was saying that hurricane Michael is a Gulf Coast hurricane of the worst kind Michael striking the Florida Panhandle uh ... ... dead hit\nAnd wins now gusting up to a hundred and Seventy five miles per hour uh the damages severe it is hitting a maximum of strength now as we speak or we welcome back to the program a good friend job is thirty he's the official meteorologist at the Sean Hannity show with weather bell dot com\nWell everything he predicted as we talked earlier in the program today has come true this is a bad bad storm it's they're now in the middle of it\nAnd uh it's more devastating than we even thought it could be\nWell we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I I Know my dad used to always say to me see if you have to tell somebody said something you must not set of loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually a we put it out publicly with a patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay\nSo you could see this coming it could see the whole pattern come in fact I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf War\nRight now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up\nEverything got together and that's why you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective I guess is the worst storm ever to hit between mobile camp I that I can find on records\nOkay now you know when the ten thousand years ago something hit worse so we're not sugarcoat that but on the other hand it's not because of your educate All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years including Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that Camille did that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida was weakening off its peak\nMost of these hurricanes and we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's it it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they have to go in and look at the damage but there's a lot more left to this storm folks\nBecause even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia that there'll be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour\nAt ... you will escaped the worst of this\nBut I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta\nVery close to Columbia South Carolina just north of pay a bill by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then we'll move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia very late Thursday night\nOn out to sea to the south of New England just be a glancing blowing the I Ninety five quarter in the meantime for you folks in the Carolinas\nAll right you you're not going to have the kind of a kind of\nCold long siege but in a six to twelve hour period\nFor much of the interior Caroline is they're going to be wind gust into forty fifty sixty miles an hour that's going to cost power outages three to six locally twelve inches of rain will aggravate flooding situations in areas that were devastated by foreign something I'm Sorry to say that we've got to
