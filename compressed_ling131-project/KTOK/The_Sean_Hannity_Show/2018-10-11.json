I didn't get it at first and then morally safer what started walking by a ticket and in here and brass at one of these guys leaving their table they all expected fireworks at our table\nAnd they were hoping to see it and of course they didn't get it\nBecause we uh we had a lovely time at night so [noise] just just\nAmazing at it and I took me a while to figure out you know what they were what they were doing with this when I was naive back in those days at any way that the brief break before we wrap it up\nOn his own software rush ... news radio one thousand Katie okay\nThey folks the IRS does not mess around you know this they have the power to take everything your bank accounts your paycheck even in your home in business\nNow if you all back taxes it's about to get worse the IRS has added a small army of private tax collectors and their job is to find you to track you down\nYou need to call opt them a tax relief they're the good guys the experts who do this best\nThey're experts in a fresh start initiative that's a special IRS program that could save you thousands even tens of thousands if you're qualified\nOne call can start the process to stop the demands letters stop the aggressive collection actions optimum has resolved over a half billion in tax debt for their clients\nThey are a plus rated with the better Business Bureau called for your free consultation now it's free called you have options eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred\nThat's market coffee creek is both are\nThey Doug Jones industrial average is down\nHundred and twenty four at the moment it was up a little bit today [noise]\nAnd there are people I knew to tell you there are people wondering if this is the October surprise because you know early voting is happening now\nAnd as the stock market goes down the media loves to talk about the Trump it caught me may have dropped out and we may be headed back\nTo our Obama reality or some some such thing so there\nAre suspicions this was all being manufactured in other words leftist willing to take a financial hit\nIn order to uh try to hurt Trump\nDon't know about that but we'll see an young folks back for open line friday at Twenty one hours\nFrom the vantage point ... who's drawing up on the beach for what the boy's eyes isn't also problems with the figures springing leaping about the flames doctoring shifting founding pulled the sky the to suffer [noise]\nLike the old politics flashing speeches and wrestling decorations who walks the string seem powerless to move and he felt doing it sounds pretty thing to the point is that some day crashing on the on the program for the kids what herring told him through the jungle because he\nHe turned and ran blindly down the trail slipping sliding stumbling just breath over choking and this is only one kind of interesting\nWe don't\nFind out what happens next by reading the book called it caused by Armstrong's they put a great book ideas visit literacy talk of a message from the library of Congress and the upcoming\nA X Y FM Ninety six boys\nThe least want to get an armed robbery suspect off this great I'm Beth Myers and the news radio one thousand Katie okay new center\nOklahoma City police are looking for an armed robbery suspect targeting motels in the metro demand has robbed at least five motels in Oklahoma City and Midwest City the latest last night in southwest Oklahoma City where he pistol whipped the motel clerk\nUh we have a tough race by the way it's going to be a tough race\nFor Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think it's done a phenomenal job a as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin in ... I Hope the people who was constant finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close\nA we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort or with the Republican camp up by two\nAnd so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer and the people in Montana can take back that state which is a red state\nThen you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee she'd been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to these all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are going to make a difference on election night and twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering up a big portion and percentage of seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats so we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates and the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would die\nJust a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump but if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy\nThe way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to a building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts on health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting them we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime from ever having the power to turn off the picket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not\nSomething that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world you know they got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs around that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either you know I Want

outrageous allegations that were thrown against this man and people still I Believe I Believe people when there's no corroborating evidence\nThat's a party that doesn't believe in fundamental basic

assaulted by one of these violent democratic a Democrat protesters during the pro Kavanaugh rally that they had last week\nAnd the Stanford Daily reports that rice Cameron who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Belinda Hernandez quote shoved him in the chest with their hand during a verbal disagreement\nOther student news outlet citing a Stamford department of public safety spokesperson said Hernandez was placed under private person arrest at rice Cameron's requests and issued a citation for battery\nOther Stanford Daily quoted a law

modern left the Democratic party there is no vision there's no there's there are no solutions being offered there's a lot of hate being pedaled around a lot of innuendos now we know they're not the party of the constitution and due process and presumption of innocence\nYou know these values have served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly now alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize if there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you don't know where these people are when we shouldn't do is incite people to violate the problem is is rational people my back down\nWhat's going to happen when the guy comes with a gun to a rally or comes with a

Bush and he said oh my God I'm Talking about what what what are they are suffering today forget about George Bush beat that ... that's a century ago what are they offering\nPeople now and how they change from the Obama years what did they offering besides I hate Donald Trump\nWas like I said we had we care about any case we care that\nI we got a bad line again I haven't been to China than what is it\nYou know suddenly you just said a second ago about how long ago George Bush was\nIn office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter\nIs the fact that we're here and now and there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that but we we have rhetoric in Washington DC\nThat is not trying to fix anything and in fact it's as if they are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will of the American people so they can go after the constitution get rid of the electoral college changed a number of Supreme Court justice is ridiculous stuff like that and it's\nHow do you become a party that doesn't even believe in simple due process the constitution presumption of innocence how you know how how do you become a party that is now noted for\nYou you know people in your party confronting people and in restaurants women Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders you can't you can't even go have a bite to eat without being confronted now\nYou know the list that you've been doing over the past year about all this stuff to have to do with the Russia investigation all that if you did a list on your show of all the things that the Democratic party is trying to do to get away from the way we live the constitution due process all these things\nI think people would be shocked at how much they are trying to get us away from the founding fathers instilled into the constitution it's shocking\nHow how do you run on the idea that I Want you know the tax cuts the largest in history putting a thousand two thousand dollars and and the average family's pocket in this country that's real money for real families the first pay raise they've had since like Nineteen Ninety in terms of real dollars\nAnd ... they call it oh those are just crumbs but they want the crumbs pack yeah I mean how do you

other countries with no excuses and what ... what happens when you do that people fall into Iran and they're easily can we're a\nConstitutional republic right you know it's for example surreal law as ... as the glaring example somebody grows up with the values that are the exact\nOpposite of what we cherish the early in this country you know where women are you know third class citizens can't ... can't drive in some cases\nA spousal rape is not even a crime and some of these countries gays and lesbians or killed for being who they are in some of these countries you can practice Judaism
