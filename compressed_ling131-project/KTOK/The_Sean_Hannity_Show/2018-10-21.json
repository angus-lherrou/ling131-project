that's exactly what it is it's like a laser versus a flashlight it delivers nutrients and didn't take a ... a lot when you deliberate ride into the ... into the ... ... talk about this explained to me a little bit about the concept or that you and your partner or Jonathan did\nOn creating these and I know that you're blown away as much as I Am by the results were starting to see\nYeah uh actually opportunity than uh to be with you today [noise] ah well first of all we were very interested in in health and their brother has some health product or another what you quickly\nThe discover however is that are not all health products or ingredients are equally bio available on the you might be able to take one ingredient and it may say you know this is more by available then this other ingredient done by this other company\nSo obviously we have a problem with delivery uh a lot of these substances are very healthy uh but we have a delivery problem or next what we wanted to look at was after trying to solve a delivery problem is how can we formulate in order to get the light nutrients\nDelivered to where they need to go\nSo we're looking at cellular biology a dishes at a very basic level was taught in high school biology sophomore year\nUh and you quickly learned that one of the main components of cell in a I'm\nAn animal or human is the mitochondria mitochondria on a singular mitochondria portal a these are called the powerhouse or the engines of the cell and we quickly learned when we got up to speed\nThat many many reactions happen or in and around the mitochondrial membranes\nThis is where the fuel or the cell is is converted into fuel that your body can use\nA these fuels or gotten from ah your diet uh generally speaking from fats and uh from sugars from carbohydrates and and for proteins they're converted into body for metabolic process\nOr into a forum that your mitochondria can use for energy but what's also needed is oxygen\nAnd this has gotten into your body of your your lungs and carried with your bloodstream into the cell to where it needs to go these processes occur at the ... so we determined that what we needed to do\nWas find the correct ingredients determine which ones would work well together\nAnd deliver them a through whatever means to the mitochondrial membranes so that we could reverse damage and the cell what we started with was a set of oil products are a lot of people want to make a product water soluble so they can uh be delivered\nWhat we started with is knowing that your biology begins with the outer membrane the outer membrane is for is composed of Olympic by layer what we need it was fashionable or a fat delivered lip it delivered um [noise]\nUh nutrients so we started there and we developed\nA what we quickly realized was a very very powerful anti inflammatory all natural anti inflammatory and from there we continue to focus on mitochondrial dysfunction how we could reverse it\nA first by reversing a the damage in the membranes second by inflammation\nAnd third how can we increase uh the unit or energy yeah British either mitochondria and that's kind of the approach that we've taken and we found that we we we've developed some very good products through that process\nYou actually did one more thing that's really important uh you had to ... to which not only increases the energy but the it causes the body to create more ...\nAnd I say that and that's what I'm In a difference one of the main difference between a healthy athlete in a couch potato healthy athlete will have a lot more ... within their cell so they have a lot more resources for a to produce energy\nAnd the right to utilize their other energy storage so it was so nominal folks on what we're seeing I I'm now\nThe products those are the ones who I Am taking right now uh everyone I've been taking for a while and it's changed me a tremendously I'm taking the alter my idol mine\nAnd I'm taking the ultra modern performed the performance more for body energy the mind more from memory and stress and sleeping well and all that and then I use a redo in jail for all kinds of situations of my neck bothers me a real low back\nOr anything of that sort of put it on my face up put it in my hair the nominal product and then lately I've been taken the ... recovery or over the last month or two\nAnd for myself I just turned six to nine and July uh and for about five years and most push ups I could do between push up bars um we're about sixty on my purse it\nAnd a twenty eight days into taking the these products all of a sudden I did eighty five now I'm doing Ninety five that's not supposed to happen to succeed so you and Jonathan I have really created some nice guys used to work for a pharmaceutical companies\nOr that came out they came over from the dark side into the light this way I like it but they were men of technologists and really bring it in their field and they came into nutrition world those great is something that has never been seen before\nNow in my commercials or you'll see me referred to a company that you can find information that I Want to do it that way because again the name will change and there's new products would become and the ... and I want to do a series of shows with you and so we're going to do some more very soon\nUm but the I when people do your

Fox News Saudi Arabia maintains journalist ... death was not a targeted killing but lawmakers don't believe that Fox's are now Scott has more live from Steve\nUm it it's so important for the future of this country for the foreign progress of the president's agenda to get out and vote in the mid term\nIt's Laura Trump we love Heather on each of Laura Lee Trump on Twitter right\nThat's correct Eli as\nMy own and I'm just saying and I follow you and your husband is maybe I'm just going to say I haven't gotten to follow but this was\nWhen I was supposed to be going more it's run by that OK appreciated um you know traditionally you bring up Kavanaugh I've been told him to the cabinet bones but it happens so early that I feel like things my pool bound before the midterms ... dying and Feinstein yesterday but gave us a golden egg\nSomebody asked her if you guys when the Senate if the Democrats win the Senate will you reopen investigations into no justice coming on Mars you should yes\nYeah well that that should not surprise anyone because we saw how crazy they got during the actual confirmation process\nIf it's really terrifying it is then finally showing their true colors that Democrats are they really don't stand for much except trying to be destructive and and do anything they can to go against the president and destroy him and I'll tell you do one of the reasons I think that you eat so much with resistance out there\nIs because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone who's down or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is winning for the country again\nAnd and they know that he's draining the swamp and they're terrified because the old way of life is over and they knew before and and it's very scary for people who are living the highlights in Washington DC or not go in and and voting on behalf of their constituents so it makes it scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he's\nHe's doing this because he loves his country to hold him to anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before um\nWhich is all the more reason that we need all the Republicans support we can and Congress\n... really great to talk to your brother in law ... I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually\nDo the ... Rouge Rudy jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process when it looked like\nYour mother in law was really going to take the stuff\nHe actually that all of them down and said I Want to do this and then two days before the famous athlete or a\nBirthday during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rise\nUp but but I I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew that my father in law to do this job he's a businessman he is so smart when it comes to negotiating seeing when he's been able to do in in so many different respects what Tara with trade um\nHe's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um\nSo for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um ... it's it's it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president gets attack every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of things going on here and there and the president\nOr you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and countries ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump her husband was there with her father in law who's the president ... back in twenty six teams are because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the leopard come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was completely unexpected he said no I knew that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on their television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been to newsrooms for a long time as well just they lean left but I didn't know was going to be like this\nShow when we when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things and and say hey that's that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it was very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for forever if\nYou know he became president at roadside hum\nBut certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn child\nNeeds to make this talk about it is it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to McCain president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life was going to come to an end so\nUm I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family members you to my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband and father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes\nThe midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything most people don't vote in Texas where I should go Ted Cruz the incumbent he was doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your brother in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided touches but under the surface those you know he's a former left wing socialist disco ward you look at places like Michigan were Debbie ... been there for three decades and it's time for her to do that when you got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show it to real seat this really used gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the reruns you can go vote for him is really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I speak to you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will\nBe onto your day ironically in Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's what a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them ...\nThink about what could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted alongside president and and really pushes agenda forward we can see so much more progress in the country and by the way\nI Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what social in them look like the look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening\nSocialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that since shock everybody to a degree that you knew not only are going to get out and vote in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your ...\nHuh and everyone in your family to go about it it's very area and I know that it felt like a lightning twenty they seem to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly what the fight isn't over you and you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent we have to get out to vote and put people in Congress and we're going to vote with the president\nIs talking about if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk today because Susan ... his wife who's from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting it is there I mean there are people waiting in line for food and the government officials will show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first is made him in that country it is horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country or cause you Cortez Beto O'Rourke you've got people who were actually saying this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nIt was did or the lawyer for laws you for the darn Weinstein who grow up with league that out there people on the left the center left or center right the center center they don't like the way the Democrats handled that hearing\nNot even a little bit\nAnd I think you can see a backlash because of that and people are starting to realize that these high profile democratic candidates are by and large socialist that's not okay\nThe story of ... use the of abortion doctors that was killing babies that were born alive\nAnd even a woman allegedly videos alleging anymore I've got ... who helped to raise money to get that film made about about comedy goes now we'll talk about the struggles they had to get that done and much more we come back right here on the weekend\nHe's the weekend with Joe ...

I don't think you could ever really find that out but they have one tiny little marker on one tiny little fraction of a scale amazing Trump's you don't need a million dollars and apologized to her help me understand\nYeah yeah you know the the rich irony in a serious point is that this week I'm a very important cases being litigated by legitimate Asian American students have um suit Harvard University which awarded\nElizabeth Warren this a position as a as a professor right because of her fake claim and those Asian American students have on earth do all sorts of admissions\nDocuments showing that they were discriminated because they were Asian American and there were too many of them and the university system right and it just goes to show you that you know the the the Olympics of grievance and the Olympics of identity politics brings us it exactly to the to this point in time and it and it's\nAnd it and it I think so many people are sick and tired of it I mean for the twenty five plus years that I have been an outspoken conservative quote unquote of color and yeah I'm darker than Brock Obama I've had all of these white progressive left is shouting at\nMe that I'm not really my ethnicity because my belief and that to me really is it the real offense here of white liberal progressive telling true legitimate quote unquote people of color that they're not people of color while they're bracing phony like Rachel ... and Elizabeth Warren\nIn approach shown king in there as well it ...

I'm not familiar with ... years ago while my luggage up you're going to send it to be yourself and you're you're going out and get an outlook theater and email it to the\nValley I Would love to do that joy appreciate your calling you and it's interesting case because you look you've got to make a decision\nEither anybody of African heritage is a person that gets this benefit or bad or anybody of Hispanic heritage is against this benefit or bad or anybody you know of Asian the heritage because there's been a very bad or we stop with the with the BS benefits for people um on on but based on identity politics\nAnd maybe just maybe we all ... opportunity to everybody I Know I Know it's crazy I Know\nWhat he's gonna throw it out there ... lives in Georgia Jim what's going on\nI go out on the first time caller and I just want to hear what your audience after listening to shale\nUm I used to work and I'm retired now and uh and it's about Nineteen Ninety five or Nineteen Ninety four scares me\nA there was a business that open up on my route ... in the clinic and I didn't know until I went in that or I could ill they ate on that in this oil and I looked around and I I just wondering why these women ... is that the lady at the reception is uh and that's what's the first time in there and I had a hand truck load all this stuff and\nThe lady the reception has told me to take it to the last right along the laugh and just put it by the window so I you know I went back to the last ... last and\nThey put it that by the window and it was a trash can there and I looked into the trash can go in there where there are a little baby sharks in their middle fingers are\nAnd I got definitely thick and I just I cut down you know it just and I asked they uh they get a polish and against abortion et cetera rate you know but that changed my mind right there and then when I went back to have a lady at the reception sign for it\nThey had a a magazine right there and I got started that let's do it\nJust ask you what it was and she said miss their new catalog and\n... it was just like a JC penny catalog or or or Sears catalog and a had a big part in it and uh had prices for a full arms fingers\nAnd now it's just something new and she was you know uh but you know thank goodness I I didn't have to go back and I call them up off the fire me if I went back in there\nWill always Im listening to this story use is startling and certainly bad that you shared it but I I got to be honest with you I'm a bind but there was a JC Penney's type catalog with baby parts on it I mean it had to be something other than a catalog well what is it what you saw what was ...\nI I'm\nI'm always called it was a catalog has a title and the front what did it say\nI didn't I didn't even look at it because that was found in through it and ask her why she signed up for it and I'm a born again Christian I wouldn't lie to you I mean I Know what I saw\nNo you you you sound you sound like an extremely honest guy I just do that there was a catalog\nWith baby hearts of armies are obviously has been exposed through undercover investigation that a lot of these abortion providers are in fact dealing in baby parts and body parts of his disgusting and it makes me sick I Would be completely startled if you saw a JC penny like catalogue with baby parts of listed\nMe I mean maybe maybe you're describing maybe you're describing it incorrectly ... wasn't a catalog let you go shopping for clothes so that that can't be\nIt'll hit was it at I look in there and it had baby parks with prices by him I I notice I Do I I'm not going to like this\nIs what would you want you to get offended by it but I find it extremely hard to believe the other part of your story I find to be very believable and I'm Sorry that you with Ruben and whether you testing and I say one thing you could say whatever you want but what I'm saying is if you can't tell me what the title of the catalog was I mean you're actually tonia some through like a JC penny catalog that makes no sense to me\nWhen I went through it I guess I Wish her\nAs horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid as as as horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid enough to leave a book like that around for anybody to see\nIt had just come in and ... she had was brand new\nBut the thing I Want to I Want to it's just like you know a a cabin on hearing and the lady that she was traumatized\nAnd I don't buy it for it because you get your traumatized you elaborate things that that happened I I mean I tell ya yeah where I was I can tell you I mean they're staying traumatized me and I know what I saw\nI I I Believe you think you saw something like that I'm here to tell you know I saw ... Jim ... Jim take a breath I Know to me if I Believe you think you saw it I Believe and you're just going to keep talking not going to help and he'd been 'cause you and I are on the same side but let me say it again I Believe you think you saw it\nThat let you go I loved the gym I Love you like crazy we can't we can't have it where you've run it's all over me a sense I listen to the story which is a very intriguing stories maybe three or four minutes but I'm I'm here to tell you that part I don't believe that you saw a catalog that looks like a JC penny catalog\nSitting around somewhere for anybody to see where you get some through it in bars fetuses and baby parts of whatever do they deal in things like that yes are you right that is disgusting yes you are\nDo I believe that there was a ... and maybe I'm getting the wrong idea of what a JC penny catalog is\nBut to me that's a catalog that use some ruined see pictures of models wearing clothing or or lawn mowers or of appliances\nI'm not buying that there was a magazine that did that now if somebody else out there has seen a magazine catalog like he's talking about at an abortion clinic I'm listening absolutely and as I said\nBefore you started with the dog will read the um I Believe you believe you saw it\nBut I find it hard to believe that that exists or that the abortion clinic was dumb enough to leave something like that

he was the governor is the governor now and the ... the Democrat nominee for governor who's a far left wing socialist a run I appreciate how are you\nI'm doing good how are you\nDoing I'm living the dream in really glad to have your own it would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happened and and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people fill my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and how things are going\nWell they really why I mean we thought I'm born and raised in Florida and we've seen a lot of storms all the young one and\nTwo homes better Ninety to buy into the worst damage I've seen in terms of Panama Sandy in terms of Mexico beach in some of the area so I'm a I'm In the south servants rising was totally out um they're starting to get power back a\n\nStructural damage because you had basically about category five\nHad um I talked to some of the sheriff's they're um they're actually progressing ahead of schedule which is good I thank God\nYou know one of that threat neighboring counties golf county they're gonna have their power on by the end but today it's supposed to be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's just certain amount of damage that we're going to have a you know at\nThe age secondary obviously we're talking around to see if there is former congressman he's a Republican running for governor of Florida gives the Andrew Gillum um this is secondary of\nCourse but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that voting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast um are going to be out there is that getting to handle a jacket and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that I'm In the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations for the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people are still in the county so I think you're looking at adding additional polling\nLocation and then I think there's going to be a consideration for if you are displaced or you can vote and other counties or your vote can silk out so I think they're working on that and by sense here that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they well look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I don't you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very ... minded so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of there's\nGot to deal with I didn't really appreciate having walked the Kennedy to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor of the great state of Florida rung you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years and I love the euro go back all the time my mom was there my sisters are there and I suddenly understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there's there is a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern tier of Florida that it's very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center right or center left but a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics like Venezuelans than the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way in Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country had been in the Congress\nThe element hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent into bbs movement against Israel they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state I led the effort\nTo move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great day you'd at one of\nThose it Gillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA total of indivisible capital so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway in areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause the Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left a which\nIs really a very hostile to Israel now\nHe's in he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government he's also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's\nIt's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in and I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian\nWho is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I mean in Florida you know we have a lot of

E. R. K. dot com and you know you it's pretty clear what's going on as soon as you go to a site like this\nYou're doing something you're seeing ads most of the time and if you do enough of that they make money because they can charge\nThe advertiser and they send you some small amount it's kind of like if you have a cash back credit card right and you get one or two percent back well of course you get one or two percent back as a credit card companies charging the merchant five percent they're giving you a little bit on the side they're making money too that's a win win\nYou know that's great doesn't cost you anything except maybe some time some attention so it's important though to understand that if somebody wants something more than that if they ever ask you this is the classic con game and this is this this is the unfortunate thing is ... con games that worked in real life\nAre now in a in the Internet world and what's funny is that the same games\nThey're the same games they're just change the Nigerian prince scam things like that they've been going on for years in real world and now the Internet's just given them a whole bunch of new ways\nTo play the game there's a wonderful book it a highly recommend a called the confidence game why we fall for it every time [laughter] spy a wonderful woman named Maria ... Copa I've actually interviewed her on this game it's a great book and it's about modern cons and their relationship to\nThe old cons\nBreeze a fascinating person she's actually a become a poker champion she's reading a new book about up high stakes poker in order to do that [laughter] she's a become a poker chair and she's brilliant\nBrilliant but her book the confidence game is a great read if you want to kind of understand I'm sure that's been excerpted magazines you could probably find it on what parts of it on line to understand these old games and how they're you know the pigeon drop games do you ever see the staying\nA ... I Love I Love con men a lot of great movies and books about con man they're just all of those games have made it to the Internet and new kind of clothing but the same exact idea and in general\nIf I were to generalize all of these games play on one thing you're read something for nothing so that's the that's the alarm bells something for nothing as the alarm bell in general things like the pigeon drop\nRequire in the long run you to give them money in order to get more money back that's how the Nigerian prince scam works for instance you ever get that email for you have a low I'm a Nigerian prince I have twenty million dollars I Need to get it out of the country fast\nAnd I need to help somebody in America\nI'm going to get in return for which I'll give you ten percent but if you answer those emails eventually they're going to say you need to put some money in my account just to pay for transit fees or whatever they're going to get money out of you so all of these ... games in the long run\nWill take your money but the way they do it is by promising you something for nothing so just don't fall for that you know that you're you're smart and the just be aware of the Internet is bringing these wonderful\nFun things into your home as we entered late stage predatory capitalism\nBut there's some some of this is fine you know if if you use Facebook and you love face but you get a lot of Facebook you know that the information you're giving them they're using to\nSell ads that's fine that's a fair trade as long as you're doing it with eyes wide open same thing with Google we get so much value out of things like Facebook Google Twitter Instagram they're all free\nBut but there's something there there's a way they're making money because they're not free for the guys who run those companies as expensive so what are they making how they're doing it generally it's advertising speaking of which is wonderful show absolutely free but [laughter]\nThat's only because we have

[laughter] well that's not the cameras name for sure so no he he he ... he gave it a name the J peg you probably know part of the name anyway um yeah what are we looking at we're looking at a black and white photo of\nSome mask that has a ... you can see the front of a baseball hats\nOn it but it's all very out of focus very artsy very eye looks like it's\nProbably been taken with a pain in the whole or with a with a lens baby or some weird lens that but I kinda liked it it it this is not about the photo being sharp and focused Crispin colorful and contrast ... this is about\nThe feeling that this conveys and looks like it's been shot on film there's scratches on edge um\nBooks yeah looks looks just it just feels right it's really interesting it's perfect for dia de Los ... which is coming up looks like Dr ... mask related to that yeah [noise] so every that it touches on the hat or thing just by having this\nYou know nowadays you look at something and you say well that could be a pinhole camera or it could have been taken with a regular camera and then filtered process [noise]\nThe way this this works jail metric plea with the depths of different different things in a different different total heart I Do think it's probably a on a lark I think is probably not a\nA digital filter neat well anyway I agree what else do we have here\nWell second one is by a user ... golden is G. A. U. N. I. S. um doesn't have a proper titles and\nChris did a lot of that in there that I Do not like I went through it\nAll the pictures they have what is the flick or the other day I made sure they all titled just because he is good yes yes\nI'm so it's yeah what are we looking at looking at a little talk about all sorts um but it's not just a boat it has a face an ad on I have no idea\nWhy you see it or you just obviously you've never seen\nIt's probably a cultural a pop cultural relevance to something in the United yeah but I'm not aware of how it all hang engine it's a kids' show oh it's from Thomas the tank I think it's okay if yeah\nIt ... it does it does it probably that means it doesn't it doesn't click with me as much as with anyone who you're always you're not from around here\nBut it's still clicked with me because it's a huge and one\nLook at face it's cute it as a hat on so um I think it's a fun boat\nI like it Theodore to see there is a bit it anytime there's Texas that picture I just make that the name of the picture so that's\nWhat I Do I'm you know that's ... that's that's the simplest thing you can do for a making\nTitles up your photos yeah think simple if text isn't a photo as you said make that title [noise] um if something simple is on the photo something very clear is on the photo that's the subject of the photo then make that the title like I did in the next picture oh in Boulder and has\nA photo of a pink hats and he called the photo pain cat it's that simple out so\nIt's a good one too I this is this is a bold pink this is a very big cat\nI likely to end it there there are several reasons why first of all just totally clear what this is about it's a pink had um the cat is in focus its biggest in the center so it's a relatively simple photo there is stuff\nGoing on in the background seems like a reception of some sort of people they are talking to each other but it's it's clear that the hat\nIs the thing that's that is is about because it's been focused and the rest of our focus [noise] um there's also a nice little color contrasting going on with the woman wearing a hat whereas a green dress or at least there's some greening address a green red is a nice primary color contrast and you can see that had\nBeen kind of looks like it's like the windy so that gives its a motion with in the things that are on top I don't even know what you call those but stuff that's on hats you know [laughter] um yeah I like it ... it jumped at me because to Chris clear the colors of so bright and\nIt was just a little cheerful photo of a hat I like it to books like ... or something some event looks looks like high class you know\nAs a classy picture a class I'm like you and me who are wearing our pheasants [laughter] I I think it is a really classy high like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "21"}
