a hundred and Ninety nine locked in Republican side you have all these thirty some odd races that are now going to tip the balance of power of the house\nConventional wisdom says that Nancy Pelosi

well against David Young\nAnd he joins us now apparently you know I Love these people in the Democratic side they're all saying the same thing healthcare health care either way welcome to the program David Young appreciate your being with us but they have people that gave us if they're going to give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shots\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from\nNancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about their they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care if they don't\nHave a lot of ... listen lying is just a part of it the playbook of the Democrats as always the same I even think it's gotten worse and I look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in those Pittsburgh synagogue and\nFrom Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage clip point two percent\nOr you know last sorcerer quarter reporting that she identified him as Thirteen members because of their tattoos\nThat would give that'd be a give away um but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking the people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let them in North Canton he but goes there'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty or nation built on a on a constitutional republic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border official telling the Washington Examiner three quarters of the caravan\nA that is traveling through Mexico to the u._s. or adult man according to a senior border patrol officer tone the examiner families and unaccompanied children make up about twenty percent twenty to thirty percent of the caravan\nRoy of dollar rail is the deputy chief patrol agent for the border patrol San Diego sector arrested that a single adult males he goes on to say\nUh Mexico now were shut down a lot of their public transportation so the people in the caravan went up to walk which you know literally weeks away and they've also offered temporary work permits to the migrants to register for asylum\nWhich I think it was a very you know Mexico's been far tougher on the illegal immigrants that we ever dreamed of big\nUm it's just sad that so many you know one of the things that America when the president talks about America First we've got to get every American out of poverty first reality ... every American their own opportunity by the way all of this at stake six days from now\nWe've got to take care of our American family first and that only enriches us to help others as well and we're the most generous country on earth as I've said so many

back in the New Jersey is where he can I'm really really good candidates\nWho is a great their CEO of a pharmaceutical company understands healthcare can help develop sound practical working alternative to government run health care and um she didn't even have may well\nBetween his only bringing people out to vote and the campaign convincing Democrats are so sick of\nMenendez and they just stay home that may actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think ... no no for the rest of us should assume\nThat this was over one of the dating stay home and then they feel about run out one voted and if you end up not by election day you're not doing anything else that day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics and they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are safe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans\nOr where the with the Republicans having them\nAlready all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\nWell not functionally uh I I my personal range is returning the bottom of about two of them one which would lead below sea ... hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy including bookish speaking um\nAnd I can't I've been in all honesty is you know I have always been candid about this I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nKnow I Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nCan anyone who does not bode has effectively voted for an she should be no one should kids themselves if you don't want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd then you'll have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services to the single phage\nIt tells you how crazy their party is how how could you know again she's smart lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services um she go down unless they think yourself\nAnybody shores I'm tired of it all you don't like to know why should sort of a I'm not going to not voting\nIs in effect a half a vote for him and she shouldn't be that should be [noise] um I think that's good\nYeah I'm Still a ... there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ...

you're voting for sure and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody and he wanted to some of the claims you're a moderate Democrat asked for the corporate leaders say I'm a moderate Democrat in the

the border\nWell it does this make you know look I think that's that's that's a pretty frankly it's a pretty reasonable statement on where we are and how good approach it uh in terms of birthright itself\nThere is no provision fourteenth amendment\nWhich you're handing away requires people who were born outside the jurisdiction of the law should be considered ... she was very clear or debate showing it in the Congress shut that John my name's Clinton if you read the view of the constitutional amendment ... very clear on what it means ah I\nPersonally think the question is far better off to look ... challenge with Congress\nTo repeal it rather than do just as a presidential jak if you order because there was an executive order the next president if\nI could reverse it but if you turned it into a law there'll be a pretty hard law I think you can change and once they got adopted and it's a healthy debate for us to have is a country because it comes back to exactly the same challenges to care of it are we as a nation\nAre we allowed to define who is an American are we in a position where we can say to people who are not American you have to meet some cash oh to be considered a to B\nWell uh to serve as a citizen and I'm saying these are very fundamental questions about the very nature of our society and I think it's a very healthy queen ...\nOrange County and found all the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they have zero zero in on us\nWell this was really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California raised as being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of in a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this was a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four safe democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats\nAnd all these thirty some odd toss ups are are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can money ... ... exactly yeah so tell us about\nYou know what are the issues there do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money in the negative ads\nYeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment at forty nine years that's you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it it Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era to where you had overregulation where you had high taxes where you\nHad government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we had over ... fourteen point advantage on me after the the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing the so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump my big margins\nBut the house it's just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job of the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that are democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out\nOh so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that uh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the problems is that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of and a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of a union you no longer have to pay your is the unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that at the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats and in tight races and one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nOr and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nNot fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day\nLet's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and what was done a thing for upstate New York\nAnd the fact that Pennsylvania takes all of the natural gas from New York and they were allowed to frack and you see the economy booming and the other side of that border and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and\nI I'm In that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago matter of fact it was five years ago today on the health care as a situation because when they rolled out before to ... became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um I told you that and my husband had gotten kicked off my plan and um I take extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's has that I've had 'em\nThat are no longer covered and yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up yet again and less coverage getting gang for tests and things that used to be covered and just I Want everybody to get out there and vote\nBecause we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that um and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was calling to talk about the health care well\nI've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody that is now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care\nWe're going to know I'm like you're the same idiots that gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep their plans have less and fundamental it's been a failure and the fact that was true none of it was true was one of the biggest lives that were told them perpetrated on the American people\nUh but anyway Mary thank you I I Wish the people in upstate New York would get the prosperity that they deserve it can be done instantaneously if they would allow fracking up in upstate New York long before they were ever an advertiser\nI when I did my own

Thirteen percent higher than Ellis and there's some really good signs here for going red in Minneapolis\nThe last thing is I Want to remind people there are very important house races in\nUh Minneapolis in well in Minnesota for those race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you did this radio show and you started your own business did\nYou make a lot more money um\nYeah I mean here I mean we were in such a bad recession in Minneapolis and when I moved out there I mean the excitement and all the jobs are not going to say I want to give us out to the oil fields because contradictory\nTo what a lot of people here about a booming and will stand I met some of the finest people in the world and the
