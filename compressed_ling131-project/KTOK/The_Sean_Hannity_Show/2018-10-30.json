Gina phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff\nJust one you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country of pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nBut thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that\nWhile the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that is now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about\nA little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm going to tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one\nIn a week from tonight and one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects Schumer then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home that the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit poll showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan and Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody there weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break it at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and and I told them the story about two thousand and four where the median again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still have time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls would they'd been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats have two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seats difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that could swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you could check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference as if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were guinea\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to the next president Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine the\nSenate landslide\nHow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world\nAll that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is a white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had\nForty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now the G O P claim they similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggested narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal they were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing loss for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nWas home [noise] summer not on a screen door to the kitchen and founded

was a pretty quick thing I'm here's an interesting article so the president and millennia go to Pittsburgh today after the terrible\nShooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous\nIt is ugly is twisted it is sick it is the family tore frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point that you ought to be able to sue for such\nSlander and ... comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi\nWho watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted and he's receiving hate mail\nFor saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable\nAnyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God\nAnd the temple and their gun down\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from an identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and\nPro Trump while the guy powers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue\nWas anti Trump and his run derby or has said the ambassador to Israel as a Bebe Netanyahu has said you know they've never heard any one president ever say stand up that if you destroy\nOur friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rushed to politicize pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump\nYou know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation is why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\n\nRose tenant friend of this program she was on with those yesterday you know she exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group\nThey want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway and it was so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how\nPastors and priests and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nTakes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\nYou know you could see the hostility about all things conservative Republican\nYou know I call for security and peace and people do take out their differences at the ballot box\nBut that doesn't stop them they're so desperate to get noticed\nSo desperate to help their democratic allies and friends when one week from today it's pathetic\nFrankly it's slander and then of itself\nNow we've got to get to the point in this country if you get slandered you ought to be able to sue and I have a chance to win or you have to prove the absence of malice well how about an absence from research because if they ever listened to watch they see a very different Sean Hannity than the caricature that they paid\nBy the way you when do you notice it was fair to us in the news media I could not believe I was on the

ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby a buddy of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence in corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think

we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nA that's not something I Want it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nYou know what do you think the colds are well listen let the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people to use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd that puts you at a decided disadvantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races are obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\nI think that's probably the reason but he's also look at it districts that he thinks he can he can do something there uh this is\nThis has been a held by Republicans for very long time and we're going to win the seat [noise] but uh yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's got to a saturation point now and people are just so upset\nI think people get up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox at the trash can and then they

doctors\nLost their plans and everybody paid more in spite of the lie the big promise of Obamacare\nWhat is fascinating as we now head into the final week of this midterm election campaign is what Democrats won't talk about now we had earlier in the program we'll had project baritone dot com and James O'Keefe on and he's not been able to expose\nIn Tennessee Phil Bredesen the Democrat Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri Heidi Heitkamp the Democrat in North Dakota\nChristian send them out the Democrat in Arizona that none of these people are being honest with the people in their respective states\nThey don't want a border wall they want sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nAnd in California they want to take it a step further free health care for anybody resident non resident legal illegal doesn't matter Gavin Newsom women's out in California\nOn top of your Thirteen and a half percent state income tax\nNow Californians are going to put up a sign welcome to California the home of free health care and I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen people are going to go to California just to get free health care great job Gavin Newsom watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exodus out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget that their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases\nForgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that people with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lied to you about people losing their doctors that was a lie you like your doctor keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and\nThis has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well where we're going to ... where we support healthcare preexisting conditions while the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting conditions and they're trying to basically go with the narrow lie that Republicans want you to die\nRepublicans want dirty or water dirty air they want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist sexist massage sticking it Xena phobic Islamic\nPhobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and Donald Trump so even though the guy that shot up the synagogue is hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also\nDirect primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be blocked renting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of new innovative\nMedicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good
