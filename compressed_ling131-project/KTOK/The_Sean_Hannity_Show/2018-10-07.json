first United States governor to be recalled\nBy the people since Nineteen Twenty one towards the nigger was one of a hundred and thirty five candidates on the ballot which included career politicians other actors and one adult film star\nThat's your look back at this week in history spot\nI'm Steve Rapaport Fox News\nI saw um a lot of people up here at the Capitol barrel out in the parking lot and then I heard screaming twenty\nWhen he suggested to you it it's Donald Trump junior really glad to have the time when he suggested to you and your and your siblings I'm probably going to really do this you're initial reaction was well of course you should do it or no way did\nListen I I wanted them to do it I you know ... it's been so Bogle he'd been so tough on it ... and it was time you know you you see the nonsense that's going on you say that the the reality is that there's no one that could have accomplished what he's been able to do that no one that you know so few that ever signed the front of a paycheck\nSo few that I'd ever you know in our whole political system that had ever had it they're somewhat family someone livelihood their safety and wellbeing of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean that was the big laugh I had last week when you know Obama's running around claiming that's like on a major you know\nI remember when Obama's ahead you didn't build that it's like\n[laughter] now now now he owns it right because his policies of oppressive taxation insane regulation general hatred towards business we're like oh you didn't do that I mean Obama himself when my father I don't know why we couldn't have three\nThree and a half four percent even even better right GDP Growth Obama goes and I look there's no magic wand for that right in New York Times back him up no no no because you know of course he can do no\nNo no this isn't a new normal well Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you've never done anything\nIt turns out your data far scissors or\nAnything you'd never had any experience there was no way and we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father has done that he has built a business it he didn't build that\nAnd so it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats want to reverse all of that they want to take everything into one eighty why because we have all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment\nFor Hispanics for women you know you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the don't ask Donald Trump came out today\nFavor of oxygen Democrats would be against it I mean that's their policy it's just hate\nBut we have to show up we have to stay on the fight because people's they've done I Love your dad doing it's so great it's amazing it's\nYou know but as I say well how are you voting for who your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean it was November right they're not even a way they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks\nSo we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on and\nMake sure the fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by I don't even know what their platform is other than you know hate and outrage I mean you know what they are outraged that they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but they are outraged about something else\nBut there are turning up we got to turn up I see it all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win as saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you got to stay at we can't just be fat happy and lazy and expect this stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz he needs guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself he imagined giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nBecause everything\nIs there a question to think about it I mean that would be a disaster for this country but we got to turn around and we've got to bring our friends\nIt's trending on drugs today to you blow so you're saying I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and ah we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time and one\nWas common sense and experience right you know this isn't a magic wand it's just you know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone actually affects your weight real change when it comes to economic fiscal policy on fiscal but I think about it we we've discussed the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end you look at the Israeli embassy you look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts fine you know we don't just draw red line in Syria like Obama did when they cross it they slap you in the face where they they tried doing that at least fifty seven Tomahawk missiles in there and guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals got NAFTA it can't be renegotiated can be done\nAnd congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done they were they were when you have a real leader\nI Wish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism was dead known how did he says is all the time too but it didn't go on one person steps up and says former President Obama just told me one thing you did\nThat caused this to happen because how do you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama dude and fixed everything how can Obama even for a second even think to himself yeah I did that because we're not\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media will yeah like I said oh no this is the new normal one point eight percent of what doesn't that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that right because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact that in bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of the ticket\nI mean and that's the only way you know his his money's coming from all places other than Texas\nBecause you know those are in Texas the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement want to eliminate ice in the ... I mean I've only saved nine hundred kitten last year from you know a sex trafficking but they're terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends\nAnd you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place to work with your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I gained ... and we have\nTo remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the access let's talk about Texas I as you know I'm based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred twelve around the country but we focus now on Texas because there's been a real challenge Robert Francis awoke as what I call these somehow called appropriating but he's Hispanic and he's not he's\nNot at all that spending and he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic something\nBut if it's something like that they would destroy ... absolutely you you you were going to get out of every day from it or it's\nNot a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it it would be you know he shouldn't be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ...\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing has been great for Texas He's done he's fought for those values I look at the ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator in Texas\nWell he's getting big support from Ellen so you know that's good\nTo Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I I ... from ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do which is your dad and then went out in the primaries but\nThere are very very similar politically in that they're not doing it politically basically I'm going to do this this this this moves\nAnd your dad and Ted actually believe I should do those things I promise\nBeat her it was just given us you know a ... puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse I listen I I really respect that I mean was it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was a big AI dinner in DC you know the usual you know this stuff [laughter]\nI I went uh and you know it was all my friends are from Texas I'm there all the time hunting fishing raised a lot of money there and campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and\nA couple of friends ... at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner and we say hey you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel right in the middle of the AC on Pennsylvania Avenue we're gonna have a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along\nIt came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours knows that got you know but you know when I showed me\nBeyond the guts if he understood\nDonald I was going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good for tax and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant huh because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean again look at where bagel rocks money is probably coming from\nThat probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that probably represents the average guy in the Hollywood studio somewhere else you know that's\nThe difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nAt Texas I mean just look at the economic success with it had to look at all the stats but you want to become California give me a ...\nAnd the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior or\nDo you have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ...

you want to win the election and I agree with that when we talk about cabinet they couldn't make anything that to be brought him early on as he said\nThey couldn't get him on the merits now let's go back and find out who he you know it might have started the auto of back when he was fourteen now the guys who abuse device allegedly somebody at a bar after ...\n... ... are they really have nothing against the guy who have nowhere to stop the guys who was Malone sitting behind him and you've got a\nFar left wing resist lawyer that's that's helping out you know some of these witnesses I mean when you step back just for a second and take a look at it\nThey weren't going to be okay with anybody were there\nAnd they're not they're also not going to those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominates Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting\nJudge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this is this is about destroyed destroying a man's life because he's he was\nNominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and

Judiciary committee and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that um but you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens but if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats your bags you're really nervous today because you're caught between a on one hand you were Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism\nAnd toward destruction and resistance an obstruction and delay and and and a stop sign as a symbol of your party and you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because West Virginians\nAnd and and Hoosier is in Indiana and certainly people in

to me it's a waste of fifty some odd billion dollars a year as far as giving credit for somebody going in protesting\nI Would I Would love to see where that actually happened and I would love to follow up on that you know what school it was\nA I forgot the name seven years old and I forget to watch anyway\nNo way listening seventies still young you got plenty of time so do you favor us send me an email at ... dot com and if you remember where that school was I'd love to follow up\nOn it if it's a state sponsored taxpayer subsidized school was no wonder when something like that private school they've got different rules would that would be ridiculous to do to give somebody a benefit for protesting on one side of an issue over the other let me go to line three Patricia was in Florida Hi Patricia what's going on\nHi how are you I'm living the dream what's happening I'm I like to have kind of\nThing for all I can get on that movie coming out yes oh come up with a nephew weeks ago I

car\nWhich Russia I appreciate you I'm not sure where to deport him too but but and and don't hold your breath because none of those people are gonna be apologizing in fact a Dianne Feinstein just friday just yesterday said are you just went down a litany of why Brett Kavanaugh should not be the guy\nAnd it had very little to do\nInterestingly very little to do with the allegations that she leaked or her office leaked about Christine Blasey Ford very little to do with that\nHer complaint was that he showed drew interrupting her interrupting other members and his anger he showed that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the court that's being able to do with no\nHe doesn't have the temperament to be on the court oh by the way members on the left on that committee interrupted Chuck Grassley in the Republicans nonstop I guess they have the temperament to be on the Senate Judiciary committee and to be senators but he doesn't know the temperament to be on the court when he was\nHonestly emotionally reacting to people ... family like crap people calling him a gang rape is he had every right to react the way that he did and dining Feinstein as all of this and she knows that she is let me go back to and say Hi to Dan in Tampa Dan what's going on high\nJoe thank you all for taking my call but I bet that's all I just want to make a comment that I Want to get a question as to buy you on the line up\nAll right arm and then go oh I think we've had it I think the year that we've had a beyond that his rule they want to pick your president they want to make the whole people are tired of the mass contradiction convoluted logic\nThe same political incorrect pseudo wise tension it's all over there and the type of turning and thank God for that\nAnd I think a great president was the one who started this and put us on this show I already I'm thankful for that you know\nUm and I and I heard your last call and your great for doing what you did diamond in my hope is a a princess and Donald Trump junior for your listeners should be taking the mental from his father he should be running someday cause that\nHe was fired or jeopardy\nOh man I mean that great family that hey nothing but crucifixion waiting liberal back at what they do to that family grateful just by\nEverything that you know it's just absolutely disgraceful and you know what I'm getting to know where you can think of him in fraud how will let them you can throw a refrigerator random it doesn't matter you know when\nYou're going to and they're still going to write down I don't I don't have much time what's the question\nWhat do you think now is that how do you think what what would the impeachment process like what what ground or in the show because that's all they talk about\nThe left will say it's obstruction of justice if they should win the house and they will in fact the way you were\nThere with all the milk light bill claim that he tried to call me to not investigate the women to be more bill so that he tried to obstruct justice to stop calling me know you look you and I agree he didn't do that but those are the grounds they'll say obstruction of justice I think they will in fact impeach him and I think the Senate would would uh would find him not guilty so\nNothing would happen but that's the whole thing and it's a great question because the the voters of his country after ... if you vote for Democrats in November one month from today if you vote for Democrats you're voting for impeachment your voters are open borders you're voting for abolishing nice\nThis is

one of the victims of yesterday's limo crash in upstate New York says the limo was heading to a birthday party\nArchitecture and landscapes you know taking and and if we're portrait sure you want a slightly longer lands maybe uh eighty five millimeter lands\nAre that can handle low light and that way you can get great portraits\nOr with great depth of field you know the background kind of fades away and the editor of portrait pops out so each lens has different features different attributes a lot of photographic a teacher's suggest however\nAnd you know the temptation is going to be the get the kit lands which usually the twenty wide goes wide just kind of ... somewhat telephoto twenty four to seven to your ... something like that\n[noise] um [noise]\nIs a nice all purpose lens a lot of teachers suggests starting with a single prime lands uh Fifteen millimeter latch which approximate the guy and really teaches composition because\nInstead of just zooming in and out you actually have to think about it and move closer move farther away really think about what you're getting that is going to be up to you and your daughter she's going to say no dad I don't want to have\nTo do all that I just want one lens and and and then you're then you're kind of yeah you get one zoom lens the kit lands and then the question is well what do I need any other ... yeah yeah it does it all\nI liked the idea of having a good low light they they tend to be more expensive the the the the how much light gathering is determined by the what we call the aperture how big the opening he can get and it's it's it's it's an inverse so the lower the F stop the wider the aperture so\nWhen you see a lens that can do at one point eight have two F. one point I even at one point for those are lenses that have a wider can go wider opening and capture more light which means they're great for not using flash for for getting a natural images are great for\nTorture they tend to be more expensive and you'll never see assume we call it a fast lands when it can do that you know ever sees him that fast\nBecause it's just too expensive a fast zoom he's maybe two point four three point five something like that and okay so I think about instead of getting the kid getting a body and then getting a nice say F. one point for fifty millimeter lands I think that would be a great ...\nEnglish but you've got to talk to her and she's got to agree with you\nAs far as which body to get it this is an important decision because if you're getting an interchangeable lens camera you're buying into a system if you get a cannon or an icon and you're going to be going candidate I come lenses forever after you know because they have custom mounts each of them\nSo you're making a decision in that regard right now I'm a kind of a fan of the ... [noise] uh I was a cannon shooter for years and actually I currently shoot Sony's which are mirror lists\nUm but ... but for her first camera maybe an icon de thirty five hundred [noise] uh this is a good ... camera it's still you know it starts at five hundred bucks\nA it is the sensors size is another thing that people often talk about and\nThis is an A. P. S. C. center which is a large censored but not full framed full frame gets very expensive ultimately that's what she's going to run but I think this is the de thirty five hundred is a very nice very high quality camera or you could buy a kit get the twenty four seven the lands that goes with a kid\nA it is here's what I Would do is the other thing you can look at is D.
