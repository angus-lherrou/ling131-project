I'm telling you I have the people are Texans are not going to put up with this\nI Know the people of Texas they're not you know you have what I think they start early voting on Monday in Texas\nUm so that's coming to to a head I mean barring a disaster I mean\nIt only is is it's like the winds me of Obama in the sense that he's cool\nOh beta or Rourke it's it it is they out side taxes phenomenon\nNot attacked it only by the way this is the New York DC thing this is the San Francisco LA thing he gets a full hour on fake news CNN he can't even gone to a million viewers\nThat's all the ... not not just taxes that's the whole country you know we could have put it on short wave radio and TV he could've done a Facebook wife short Twitter live show and done better than a million\nAnyway so you know then you know Texas by the way we have some examples there of people asking non citizens to register to vote that's now becoming a big problem down in Texas oh by the way even MSNBC held paid or Iraq as a rock star you can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA yeah try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us\nFour thousand people strong that want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what if they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using and this is I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nThat's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are\nTo be successful or the president well he offered now he's spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor and any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh they wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his late well now they want to Ninety One\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex Rick Scott has killed himself and done such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is\nAll hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I maybe it doesn't have the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing I'm a little sick of a lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be asked that talk a good game and just all lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy that's why project very tossed catching rather than on tape\nAnd his campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support cabinet he's not going to support cab and he's not going to\nBe but [laughter]\nI just can't even actually does yeah like I was [noise] but\nWe're still like I don't see much again my husband's like [laughter]\n\nMeasures that have straight

the same thing Claire McCaskill's exposed doing the same exact thing\nAnd that usually she's more progress and then she ... she already had her when she [laughter] she doesn't mind so she has a lot more or less what might know she's a lot\nMore radical than what she says oh there's a story that just broken Claire McCaskill is going to be problematic go see it on Fox News dot com and the headline is her husband is accused of abuse by his ex wife\nAnyway was reportedly accused of domestic violence and Missouri candidates a Claire McCaskill has been accused of domestic violence and as one company wants to victim blamed a woman who sued for sexual misconduct\nOh I Wonder if she's going to speak out like a I've been waiting for her to speak out on Keith Ellison or keep waiting because we're not going to hear any of it\nAnd we got of course ... Harris other prominent Democrats they slowly leak out what they want now Maxine Waters revealed that they keep saying they keep telling me the whole day it just ... will do it but don't pay about impeachment\nJohn Podesta group saying just don't ever talk about immigration to get off the topic is that they can and and talk about anything else\nBut as they want to open borders they want sanctuary cities they want amnesty they want sanctuary states they made a political calculation that that's going to benefit them down the road ... Harris\nYou know literally and other Democrats are now saying they want their crumbs back they want to repeal the tax cuts\nThat set off the booming economy we haven't seen that is setting records for decades and she wants to stop it she wants to replace the tax cuts with cash payout for the poor and working class\nWell fifty percent of taxpayers in America pay nothing we already have redistribution\nThe crumbs that go to businesses and middle class Americans one two thousand dollars a month and it's impacting their lives and creating you know jobs that we thought Warren coming back to America for a million new jobs in Trump's elected\nEight million Americans out of poverty and all for food stamps four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created and what do they want they want to go back to Obama\nWell what we're going to add another you know Thirteen million Americans to food stamps and we're going to put another eight million Americans in poverty or going to have another eight years where we don't reach three percent GDP Growth we're going to accumulate more debt than every president before him combined that's what you want to go back to Nineteen days I don't\nGo to universal men's clinic dot com for tips information and links to a healthier you first responders union members and military make your appointment for November your initial office visit my test will be free co universal men's clinic at four zero five nine for two thirty one hundred\nThat's four zero five nine for two thirty one hundred more visit universal men's swimming dot com whose radio one south\nOkay [noise]\nHighest we're all long Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine foot one Sean toll free telephone number you know with all the devastation damage that is down in the panhandle of Florida\nI did it all these people have been displaced the panhandle\nUsually determines the panhandle in southwest Florida southwest Florida being Sarasota of Fort Myers or Naples, Florida I mean they play such a big role in Florida as voting as long as well as the eye for ... or\nYou know Tampa Orlando everywhere in between and um because of course then you have\nPalm Beach county which you know didn't pull him pulled you\nKnow hanging swinging shattered ... at just ... chads if you remember back to that point if you don't know what I'm Talking about the war you don't need to know\nThat was the two thousand election it went on forever but do you see these guys with their\n... what do you call those uh what do you ... ... not microscope magnifying glass looking well was that really a vote for Buchanan who sits at the time\nI'm as I look at the Senate I'm worried about Indiana because you've got a libertarian that is ... votes away from the Republican by the way that he's going to join us on Hannity tonight and\nYou take the libertarian component out of the polls and Joe Donnelly toast in Indiana\nYou can't waste your vote on the libertarian and I'm not trying to be rude I Love libertarians I've libertarian positions but the reality is it's ... they're not drawing any votes away from Donnelly the drawing them away from his republic Republican opponent\nI think Heidi Heitkamp deserves to be sent packing and hopefully we'll Jon Tester can be beaten in Montana trust I'm telling you I'm looking at the numbers\nRick Scott can win in Florida it's way too tight for comfort you cannot elect Gillum in Florida as your governor you will destroy the Florida economy Marsha Blackburn will be a phenomenal she's an honest person on like the phony that fake that fraud brother said\nThey would Claire McCaskill what a phony she is\nThen of course you've got the radical in Arizona cinema oh my gosh and then also going to learn about her hanging out with radical lawyers to defend the blind shake inviting them you know oh it's okay to join or the Taliban no problem what\nArizona's a crazy [noise]\nBy the way Dean Heller is a very important racy need support in Nevada will continue [noise]\n\nFriday October nineteenth what's new today on the free I our radio I check out our cat tire radio resentment inside a studio featuring a brand new episode with the legendary sir Paul McCartney\nKnow him and treat them with Joe leaving to talk about his new album Egypt Station and of course some discussion about a little band called the feed off we were ... when we were playing music I heart radio present and maybe I'll check it out\nUse radio one thousand Katie okay\nHannity less government this is Sean Hannity show [noise]\nTwenty five down till the top of the hour eight hundred nine foot one Sean toll free telephone number were on the road\nWill be in Houston, Texas tomorrow eleven AM we're hoping that you will have the opportunity to get out and join us as we are going to be in Houston at a town hall or the interviewing Rick Perry and and Ted Cruz and a ...

Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people at Penn is the the same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christian cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a sign that join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha mix Sally\nIs fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pick up in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida vote for governor in for Rick Scott is always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi once she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate and\nHe wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate looked like they are going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people of New Jersey of had\nIt with him and you know now that his association with the Chilean Epstein guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up in the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell hey where America stands and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go away because of his eight operationally democratic state but\nThe other states you cite Sean I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective and the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look at it yeah it was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated vets are coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nFoil let me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for a pillow see if you stay home it's half of ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for a pastor and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know bread on the news just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn and you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for ... because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with pillow see in the house and told the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually paying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it anymore John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats should not talk about
