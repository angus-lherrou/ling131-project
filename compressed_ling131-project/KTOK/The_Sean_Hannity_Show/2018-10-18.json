I don't want to talk about\nIt just don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm gonna keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment and lists never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want oh why did they won't open borders they calculated that's gonna benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can't say they didn't know\nWhat that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline psychotic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they weren't open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power for ever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs he pulled by my care open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBut goes after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to what we don't want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them the crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what does the leftovers they have\nYou know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms their house Kim's there you know house barber shops there Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves well they're not they're not on Obamacare they got a separate health system just for them very different\n[noise] so that's what's at stake you're not going to tell you something about this border as I watch this care of it you\nGot to understand this is about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times site Hannity you've told us that before\nYeah I've been on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot Yemen all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego and many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life for who's healing drugs confiscated guess where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country is is one that you know why\nThe issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet they try a bike and then a Percocet to knock the con and then\nThey go back there got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give a rip it these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of theirs so why don't you try heroin does much better high and the only ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it new light it up in smoke it and then eventually they're going to be main lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called fat and all\nYou know talk to my buddy Eric poli his Nineteen year old son bought an than that which is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt it will kill you\nAnd we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes you know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see what's happening all\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nThat no corroborating evidence I don't believe her\nYou know but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the whole first they spike the punch bowl and after they spike the punch bowl the boys would line up in the hall every weekend and then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend\nAnd then the story of violence didn't too well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again\nAfter eight FBI investigations what are they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got for a million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama said would never coming back\nSince he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations than the last five presidents\nCombined uh he's opened up the entire energy industry of which we have a flawed\nLiterally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs high paying jobs for so many millions of Americans\nAre then we've got oh the president the grading ISIS nobody thought little rocket man would stop shooting rockets nobody thought that you know being tough on the Iranians would would bear fruit but the Iranians are dying economically because of the president leading a boycott\n... ... us\nWe rode along where you are in beautiful Palm Beach Florida\nRush Limbaugh for the hour tonight hope you'll tune in and be watching\nYou know I'm looking at the caravan thinking four thousand people four thousand migrants now thankfully we actually have a president that stands up for the United states of America\nAnd thankfully we have a president that saying you know this is not gonna fly with\nMe or the American people and the president is now saying we're going to stop you in your track and the president has now poll Mexico and Honduras um excuse me\nUh in the strongest terms I'm asking Mexico doesn't sound like an ask\nAt is stop the onslaught if you're unable to do so\nI Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nThen he posted another one continuing to blast Democrats because they're the ones that won't open borders eliminate ice in sanctuary cities and free health care for illegal immigrants course free means you pay for it\nI'm watching the Democratic party led because they want open borders and existing week laws\nAssault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and whose leaders are doing little to stop the large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico or to the U.S and he said that he will poll aid for these countries\nAnd then he said the assault on our country at the southern border including the criminal elements and drugs pouring in as far more important to me is president then trade and the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border this is all the Democrats fault but week laws and of course they don't want to build the border well guess what it also means it means more drugs\nComing into every small town in big\nCity in this country this should be on your mind and Nineteen days

they're losing a the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I ain't gonna keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new electric violence a which in the end I think turns people off because it's it's it's it's also a little scary because as Steve ... proved when he was shot um [noise]\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is it's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes\nAbout running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas Komen aiding and a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as the pension its intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the fourth\nA cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now\nIf you go back to Goldwater fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and in the end I think that just further isolates come\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they want him peach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and that's partly because if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination to childish behavior by\nUS Senators in Senate meetings I think all that came together to really really galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear the argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein for Locy San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody\nWho can get finance and remember these three thousand people I I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people will probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among a U.S border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nAnd by the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says that she doesn't want any distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor in California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party of the galaxy the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier and a party which\nBelieves that can't win with legal American votes and so it's got to try to find some way\nTo turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch developed\nOr we're going to get Newt Gingrich has predicted Nineteen days till election day I'll also his take on the show gave it looks like murder and who's responsible and how the

Hannity on Fox News will continue [noise]\nBut I don't really have any doubt that this guy was murdered and murdered by the Saudis and I doubt it happened without the crown prince and other top people in Saudi Arabia knowing if that's the case\nYou know I Know Democrats want to pressure Donald Trump into doing whatever they want to do and making this the biggest litmus test but let me remind people\nThat Hillary Clinton in the Clinton Foundation took millions from the Saudis she never brought up their horrific treatment of women killing gays and lesbians she never brought up one time the persecution of Christians and Jews in Saudi Arabia\nUm and the same would go for a look at how they treated Benghazi but with that said we already know the double standard exist what are you what do you think\nThat's why I think I mean I think first of all that the president is right to be cautious\nOr do indicate Clinton that we don't necessarily know all the things that are going on in that I I think there will be very foolish\nFor us to a break a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key to containing Iran a but but I think we have yet to the bottom of it let me also point out to ...\nOh I'm just now working on a novel for next year called collusion in which the Russians are decide they want to push in the U.S Senate or if I were writing a novel about a Saudi journalist\nBeing killed and the circumstances are just strange that that they're going to kill him in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nKnowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time they're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people [noise] um\nIt's almost like if they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nIs a vague on their sloppy and stupid and you know ... ... it's unbelievable the position they put any of their allies\nAnd you're right we have this on precedent alliance against the Iranian had Germany with the Saudis Israelis Emirates Jordanians and Egyptians and it you know now that creates massive complications\nWell in but if you look at it you know we've said pretty clearly we're not going to tolerate the Russians poisoning people in Great Britain it's led to very specific sanctions or I couldn't imagine a circumstance where if we do in fact decide that the evidence is overwhelming under the Saudis\nHave the least promised secretary of state compare that they're going to give him the full report you know again\nOr they may well be lying but\nIf in the end oh we discovered that there are key people in Saudi Arabia involved I suspect it will be sanctions but those differences wanting to have sanctions it's another thing you know to go wild and break up the\nThe alliance and the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear that they regard Saudi Arabia as such an important a\nDefense against Iran or do they have urged us to be very careful and this process\nWe've got to go but um that's the speaker uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy are aligned with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat Nazi has a\nContract and I think sometimes you just said you know we have taken steps against Russia in concert with the British\nOver killing ... trying to poison several people but we didn't we didn't go to church I think we may have to take significant steps ear and sanctioned some people and block some people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly as the crown prince had better clean this up or he will not be allowed back in the U.S for a long time\nI missed the bigger thank you for being with us we got to take a break by David shown and Carter Page will join us as the deep state gate gets a little deeper eh my

describing what he understood took place in that meeting between Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein where Mr Rosenstein talked about actually recording the president of the United states so he needs to come in and answer questions like I said if it's ... that's exactly what should be a shoo\nSo you you were in a deposition with with James Baker the first one and you're going to end with him this upcoming Thursday what do you want to get from James Baker this week\nWell first of all remember who said this is this is the FBI chief counsel all kinds of things flow through him so when he said that he believe Rod Rosenstein was serious about this this outlet it's alleged a statement about recording the president\nYou got to take that with the way that it comes with because if the if the FBI chief counsel so we're going to ask you more about that we are our previous deposition was cut off early\nWe go we we ran out of time so we need him back in there we're we're going to ask more about

for the size of warrants\nWas the pony never verified never corroborated Russian dot CA that Hillary paid for there's so much it stinks to high heaven or John Solomon I was an article yesterday in his article what he's talking about all these FBI pop the oj officials there on all the special interest junk kits\nAnd guess who is probably the most frequent user of the Robert Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann yeah that Andrew Weissmann went after Paul Manafort that Andrew Weissmann that of course was responsible for tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs as it relates to Anderson accounting\nWhen you go back years and the Enron investigation\nThe same guy that was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court\nThe same guy the center for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals but sounds complicated it really isn't it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country\nAnd I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence\nThat we give these people supposedly to protect us joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown in Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and a quarter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly sit the deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled and they needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ... to do it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the bicycle I Would think you'd be indicted right now if you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting it destinations\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days a week with within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of good government that hopefully uh hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall\nBut here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and that I think we're getting into that as you've been a a all over in terms of your reporting so\nSo I bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roles called oversight their job their their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators they benefit struck did every\nStep of the way request document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turned out to be having nothing to do with national\nSecurity only an embarrassment to them now we see in in just the last two weeks oh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here's enough time to testify under oath\nWhen Simpson is pleading the fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear in testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe in one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits in the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for sticking not only information but also damages and relief and is now by the way of course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong things have gone with the five to court and otherwise and governments you hit the\nProbably the most important point going on here Congress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work and good last words as vital Congress can no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks\nI think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we talk about this Ninety nine page report\nOn fire the court a abuses that uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts an agenda by law enforcement officers to invade the law there is by the way one author or as in you that no one really has exploited yet and that's a fight the quarter review\nThere is a court that just above the five to ... it will also under their rule for considered procedural motions there are three judges to chief justice of when you're right now that I just ran us and telling talent is different circuits maybe ... maybe that court should be the subject of the uh the ... the forum for a motion to review what's going on to\nFight the court also just remembering you have in the ... court efforts\nBy the ... where are these buys a court judges a fraud was committed on every one of them they were that run verified uncorroborated information to spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page\nWhy haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should do outreach collie or the judge and the court and these judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and it violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out anytime the most sensitive area\nOf our government probably because it's an ex part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nNo you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival start with you to get your reaction considering you\nAs of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ... Carter Page that I don't know about you are as\nOf now have you with this horrible person that needed to be surveilled\nAnd not just basically a I don't know shaken the armor to get a Trump and then you become the on winning victim in a witch hunt against him but you know because you were light about they use phony information to obtain the war against you but of all the agencies and the federal government\nSolomon points out that shouldn't be immune to special interest schmoozing the the OJ it's premier law enforcement agencies like the FBI today the bureau\nOf Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives topped the list their independence from influence and their integrity and meaning out the law fairly are essential to their success and the trust\nThe American public puts in them but\nThis week the D. O. j.'s internal watchdog put a rare spotlight on the gratuities inside the department and then he goes on to explain to people and the FBI and the OJ accepting free sporting event tickets\nFrom a TV reporter they don't even give the names of recipients hundreds of pages of government ethics filings revealed that in the past three years the deal Jay under Democrat Republican presidents has allowed hundreds of their employees to accept free travel\nLodging food from special interests across a blow globe and I'm looking at it this and I'm saying you know\nReally you've got to be kidding me because if anybody else did this that would be called influence peddling and on top of the list we got a guy by the name of Andrew Weissmann new accepted apparently more than a dozen free trips your reaction Carter\nSean you know this goes back to sort of the crux\nOf the matter in terms of my case and all the abuses that happened around day it's not about me and it's not about\nAny ah any you know specifics in terms of myself it's really about our country and I think what you see in terms of some of these actions that they were doing I'm against the rules and potentially against the law that really reflects you know people just looking out for themselves and yeah it's like President Trump\nAlways said as a candidate a it's not about me it's about us and you know\nWhen they when they come after me they're they're just doing it to ah to get get him at the end of the day so that was it's really a a a huge problem\nWill pick it up with the Carter page David show will get his reaction of that on the other side eight hundred nine four one Sean you want to be a part of the program by the way my buddy Steve ... is going to weigh in at the bottom of this half hour want to remind you look my pillow has changed my life\nI fall asleep faster I stay asleep longer it just works is these are drug or alcohol induced now my pillows even gotten better because they created the my pillow mattress top are now all the benefits the comfort for your neck you find your back\nFor details we live in a world blurb sound and we hope one of the ... sound you hear in the morning is turning on your TV ...\nNews you know during mating morning you're not only watching news wherever you're listening to I like to have you been\nOf what you need to remind\nThem game rained yellow Hamilton and you'll get the news and traffic to to start your day off by\n...
