secrets that Damon his stock down yeah the ...\nThe reason I bring this up ladies and gentlemen as because today we're talking about the your your your likelihood of being financially successful and here's something that I think it's because you know Victoria part of the reason I looked at this because you told me this is this is one of your goals not a dream a goal okay\nThat's the thing about your the power of thought you know I I tell the story all the time in my classes that I teach\nYour ability to think and how you think will dictate your success and the story I use is is every day you drive down the road and you see this gigantic house and it's your dream house it's everything you've ever wanted\nAnd one day you drive by and you see that the houses for sale and run a little flyer that they have out front it says a price tag of five million dollars now what kind of person are you are you the kind of person that thinks oh I could never afford that or do you think what do I have to do to afford that there's ... that's the key right there yeah\nAnd so you know you're thinking to yourself what am I going to do to get the American express black car nut and oh God I can never get that you know if you see that then there's a pretty good chance it's never going to happen but if you make it even a one person reality in your mind\nThere's a better chance you're going to work toward that and that's a big part of being financially successful is just imagining that all these things are possible\nAnd the thing is is that you talked about earlier is riding down the skulls and in getting your financial house in order so first you've got to get your financial house in order\nNothing's ever going to happen unless you get your financial house in order then you've got to take the the God given talent said she had been given and you've got to figure out okay how am I going to make this reality well I can tell you how it's every single day you do something towards that go\nIt's just like when I get out I say every day to things is and one is how am I going to or what I can I Do today\nAt to help us grow our business and that means how many more people can we help then the second thing is is I had a personal goal is the second thing is and what can I Do today or who can I talk to the day to help Kevin ... become gather and I have done that\nSince probably I added the Kevin ... since March\nAnd and look what's happened ... you know he beat out nine candidates he I mean he's doing it so it's you that you've got to say it you got to write it down and then again I tell people you have to share it but what it is done it's helped us returned gulls because I wear his one\nSecond I Love multitasking\nBecause it's helped people have a conversation Victorian very interested in why\nThat you think this is so important for Oklahoma against all these under four wonderful people that we had had to step up to the plate to test serve our state and ... but it's open up conversations and re engaged\nRelationships that I had you know I've been working my nose has been to the grindstone I haven't been out and about as much as I Would like to be or should be probably\nSo you do have to write them down and you must make it a priority but you've got to start your day off with that much for every single every single day or the year is going to be over just like that because we all know how quickly it happened around Christmas I mean we just celebrated New Year's eve and it's now Christmas\nWell here's the crazy thing ah Thanksgivings about a month away didn't need to remind you don't eat er well I didn't need to but I Want to just one one of the new enemy to hyperventilating I Know what I was a little bit\nAnd look we know that you're listening right now because you are a goal oriented person or you wouldn't be listened wouldn't be listening to the show and you're probably wouldn't be listening to the station was heavy honest people to listen to the station\nAnd shows like ... smart people who are goal oriented and you want a lot out of life but you also know that you can't do it alone and or maybe you had been doing it alone you haven't been getting the results that you want\nTo say oh you've done a really good job and now you just want to go be retired and you want to have a partner that's going to help make sure that she had that piece of mining confidence and trust that it's all going to happen the way he wanted to\nAnd just just like our ... he said this week look I I'm a smart person I I could probably do this but I have no desire to I Want someone who's going to hold my hand I just want peace I Want to save harbor that I can come to you guys are going to help and I just want peace in my life so I can go do what I really enjoy that's right and that's what that's what we do that's\nThat's that's the whole purpose why we exist\nAs I say all the time that it is it's all about you know waking up every day knowing that we had the privilege of making a positive financial difference in people's lives I mean who wouldn't want that and yeah I Love what I Do\nSo if you are looking for that as well give us a call if you have at least five hundred thousand dollar save for retirement that number is four or five three for eight zero nine zero nine we will sit down with you and uh and just about sixty minutes\nWe can help you figure out what shows have to go that's right and um you know what you'll get your financial advisor in order you'll have\nSomeone holding your hand through it all and those

happened man [noise]\nBy Tom [laughter] um well I certainly I wasn't home when this happened um nine ...\nNine one one call a caused by a neighbor's cell phone calls the police to break into my home when I wasn't here for obvious reasons that we're doing a welfare checks\nAnd that trying to get I have no qualms about that but when I did discuss the matter with the local police chief and by the way this wasn't Waco proper it's that ... it's a a suburb you say I'm\nA ... he wasn't quite feeling me on the same thing that you were talking about a just a few minutes ago about criminals dressed up as bleach\nOreo that it could have been very tragic long story short I did have the opportunity to meet with a small town mayor and the police shape and we did iron it out and he did apologize on behalf of the department and promised to reveal his policies and procedures [noise]\nWhat was he not I mean when you said look this could have gone badly if I've been at home I Would have shot whoever commend the door I assume that roughly what you said\nThat's exactly what I said what was his reaction to that\nIt was pretty a brisk a it was kind of uh\nYeah he wasn't ... with a citizen telling him that\n[laughter] yeah what kind of a sudden next right that\nThat's just that's just the just as it right there he was not happy with us and telling them hey I would've\nI would've shot to defend my home and even at your officer or in uniform I Want it done that is because I and our reference to them all if you do an Internet search shift as you discussed a few minutes ago that he will see several news articles of criminal\nDoing home invasions dressed as police and and I told them it that I said those high powered rifle happy a K to shock on and so forth my train with it every year I didn't pay 'em a tactical training course for today and in this area every year every year I go\nMhm was he surprised at that\n[noise] um he was a little bit surprised but not much\nI mean this here's the thing I\nSaid look if the police need me\nComing you know to talk to Tom Gresham or if they want to arrest Tom Gretchen [noise] all they have to do\nIs knock on my door or call me on the phone in my house and say hey we're the local police we were outside your door we need you to walk outside\nCool I'll do that if the knock on the door and say we need you to come outside now cool I'll do that\nThey don't have to kick in my door if they know it's they're actually coming for me so I have to assume whoever's kicking in door is doesn't wish me any good will\nThey're there to do me harm that it's the only safe assumption because anybody who picks in my door is there to do me harm\nAnd you know there are at some point on the sheer there are things you can do this really simple it will cost you exactly zero dollars that can keep somebody from opening your door\nUm which I got from ... guy [laughter] uh I mean physically it keeps the door from being opened\nUm I go into some by going to give us some salt whereas I Want to share that are not ah but I Am so glad that you had that conversation with him in and it's one of those do you have to say well look officer if you if you're at home and somebody kicks in your door what are you going to be doing\nWell that's where the mayor came in ah the mayor did see it on my perspective on that he totally agree to said you know what I understand your perspective he said I Would have done the same thing\nAnd SARS where people say well you know I Want my doors at night really [laughter] how about just lock your doors whenever you're

to talk about that kind of just bought the ... Hoffman a from Cal guns or hey gene [laughter] I don't know about you I've been smiling for about a week now\n[laughter] absolutely but I still want to see the see what I Want to see the dishes granted I once a year for ...\n... ... exactly ... or ... one of the things that are I guess just to cover very quickly when cases the requests search your you search uh basically they asked the Supreme Court to accept them it takes a four votes to be accepted obviously takes five votes to win\nIn the past on a lot of important Sacramento cases have been turned down by the Supreme Court they somebody would not even accept them\nWe don't exactly know why but the thinking is maybe internally they said you know we're not going to have the five votes to win it's let's not take it at this level and make it a precedent the Supreme Court precedent let's just not even take the case that\nOkay what run the math for us now I mean is it really five four are we now look that up for four plus Roberts as a swing we still don't know what's going on with them\nYou know I'm worried maybe go out of the kind of internal conversation about how we just bought was always a question of whether it was Kennedy or Robert Jewish person who you were saying yes that he's had real interest I mean\nSome of these cases that weren't grant and I had a Thomas writing saying Richard ... second like second class right you know first thing to see is whether or not we're dealing with cheap\nWalkie secret court you know out of certain political arena um you know ... one of the potential negatives adult for\nComing for is that it may make you want your weight or eat [laughter] [noise]\nOh I see to let it settled down to say and some people say well see now this is what there was it was all about wisdom Supreme Court or the second amendment and guns and all and he said look let's just let it settled for a while Mm\nYeah and unfortunately opposite distract from like ... the well we certainly you know how or solid vote at all on\n... ... it's\nYou would run through a few of the cases that either are you know already been appeal to the Supreme Court are headed that way logically and you know because there's some really important ones out there\nBut it's it's it's basically ... hours I'm white now sitting in front of them is um\nCalifornia and gun roster where are they going to get so you can't sell a new maker my oldest firearm and gun in California that they're going to find them also a mass out of Texas where people who were trying to buy\nFirearms from Texas dealer like a goodbye right\nAnd that was overturned by the circuit that's now but the ones that are I think\nEven more critical um you have magazine bans are both from the east coast here in California\nThose cases are likely to work quickly 'cause we California they've been on Nellie and join the other things that are out there I'm In California you know we kind of famously warn them had overturned on ... that state scary and somewhat\n... that was not granted served a follow on it by ... younger ... Hawaii or to the panel said well you don't have a right to feel some have right Gary so you must be equal in Hawaii\nI'm ... but that's again Gary where Supreme Court in short order\nYou know I'd like to return to that first case because I'm not sure that people outside of California fully appreciate what the handgun lost her is\nAnd how it has been corrupted now there is a foregone to be able to be sold at a dealership in California\nThe state has to approve the specific model of the gun and has to be a submitted by the manufacturer and they put on the list of not unsafe\nGuts which I Love click right not unsafe so in other words you can sell these guns you can buy these guys and then several years ago they said yes and one of the things these guys are all going to have to have this micro stamping\nAt which point the manufacturers said yeah except that it doesn't exist we can't yeah Microsoft and\nSo when a gun falls off the list and anytime you manufacture changes something in a God it falls off the list and it's required to be re submitted except now you can't we submitted anything because nothing has microscopic how to do\nThat's ... that's exactly right I mean and and the the way to make it very practical California the generation or clock illegal to sell in California\nA Mediterranean type this will tell you it's easy easy easy and a doctor's Carter in Webster you guys have been doing that for the better part of this year is it helpful is it nice to know or is it really a game changer you tell me\nWhy like I said the game change you know in the paper and we do run quite comprehensive 'em let animals but these animals you not like anything at that age will CNA\nAnd when you have that type of information you that just opened up the keys to solving the mystery of weight gain or\nCrazy or\nThe inability way even with exercise or what you assume the proper exercise loved it and I sell it to increase their cardio but in some case that you mention there he NA reflects something completely different and maybe it has to do it more strength training\nSo evidently a game changer to have the day I'm Asian and able to say like you said yourself\nA lot of drag yourself a lot of time and again like doing something right that really works for you and solve that mystery of why am I hungry all the time or why you certainly is not um work with my\nMy over on Capitol is intolerance is certain is so true during the\n... you know ... nobody has said it better than you and I got to tell you\nWhen you guys first started doing this or it was so exciting to get feedback I Would come in have you seen anybody\nYou'd say yeah there was a patient and here's what here's what went on I Know what it's like to do nutrition counseling and to give people a one size fits all diet and work for some and not for others or tell them to do exercise and I give them a one size fits all exercise plan and it works for some and not for others\nIt is good to not have to

are about to blow doors off with that you have you had a lot of good feedback so far\n[noise] yes they have a lot of people excited about this huh\nYes we're very we're very excited about it Kelly with us now for about a month and a half and certainly we knew that Kelly even before we brought her and she is a veteran when it was a Saturday and very good at her job\nWell when we do the I just

you guys are the best and really and truly a these sisters are on the very cutting edge of all of these things they were the very first ones to do the DNA tests\nVery first ones to give me feedback and therefore they're the ones that were debuting the brand new skin genetic test called skin fit one place in Oklahoma has it it is\nAnd I realized that this guy for what he wanted to achieve he was already halfway there and I said I could I don't know single family but I can tell that you could be where you want to be in a year just by doubling down on what you've already done and with what he told me that the money had to invest was I said I think it'll take you longer to get there\nGoing the multi family route but I'll be happy to take it or if that's really what you want to do and are made him rethink what he wanted to do and and so that was one thing that happened the common thing I think is passive investors\nWho are trying to figure out how to juggle getting involved with lifestyle while working in the job that they enjoy it and as you know paying for it to themselves and their lifestyle as it is and these are always conservative people they're like minded as we are they're just looking for a better way to do a kind of what they're already doing and\nI really find myself emphasizing to them that I call this a contact sport and that is you've got to get involved you've got to get to our parents and meet other people doing it because they will accelerate your ability to get involved and deals to do your own deal whatever it is that they're trying to do\nAnd the three people that I can reference uh that are already up and running as passes and are going to be closing on their first deal within maybe by the end of this month I think\nUm those are people that took advice and they started showing up at the road trips the case studies I started shaking hands meeting people that were doing deals and ah got caught up in a very quickly\n\nNow one of the themes I ran into and I don't know if we run into this as much anymore and you've only been here six days so maybe you haven't been through a large enough cycle yet to see this happening one of the things I used to run into all the times got somebody come to me and say\nYou know I Want to do single family but then they went on a road trip and we next week they called back you know just change my mind that procedure was on the road trip I Want to be ... family\nAnd you know the a week later the sale to start out as a past have been in a week after that to come back to snow you know one after seeing this I think I could do this to I Want to be I I wrote a you know and then come back and say you know what I'm looking for these smaller deals that they could go ahead and go up to you know\nI'm a lead investor you run into any vast solutions yet\n[noise] ah yeah the one that I'm working on they actually came in to be passes but there are retired and may have seen enough now where they're going you know what we could do and we have the money to do a forty ... maybe we should start doing that\nBecause they're ah they're kind of being picky which uh I don't blame him for probably not a bad idea on who they invested with and and that cycle takes time to understand what makes a good partner for your specific situation\nAnd finding somebody that has the same goals are is on the same track that you are and uh yeah so they're swinging back around now and we started talking about them just doing their own deal and part of that actually was me telling them look I've already got two people that are by twenty minutes and this is just happened in the last you know forty five days\nSo uh they realize that that could happen a little faster and ah and I think you know sometimes you just got to push people off cliff little once they get to the edge\nAnd ah so I I think those that couple will go that way but all the other cycle she I don't think I've been around quite long enough to see the transition that you have a twenty seven years or however long you been doing this\nWell the next one is um a more difficult question I'm you've done some due diligence so far [noise]\nYeah we actually did a deal a Monday ten days ago now um for a guy he's actually out of central Texas or what the deal is in El Campo which actually falls in Houston a territory so it came to me\nUh we went on site didn't know I'd never stopped at the Capitol I've driven through it on my way to fishing trips down on the coast but I've never stopped there so I got to go down there for a day they had done a nice job of pre shopping the market we walked all the units\nAre had some contractors they're looking at everything to decide how much work needed to be done on it before going in so they knew how to properly budget for any a deferred maintenance and things like that gets thing off to start [noise]\nAnd I actually I just got a text from two minutes before we got on air here and he wants to talk this afternoon he's read on his business analysis and he wants me to take a look at it and\nKind of play devil's advocate on what he's missed and whether I take the deal still work or not\n[noise] well I think that's probably a good place to take a break we'll pick that up on the other side also when we\nCome back we'll discuss this guy's deal just disgusted saying yes or no deal

went to court insisting he be allowed to compete on the J. B. team\nAnd by filing an age and gender discrimination suit against lady too high and the entire school district this bicycle kick of a mom showed her child just how one should not handle adversity now looking for money or forcing a coach or team to do something is no way to go through life\nThe time for making the varsity team was the months and years of Mr preparation that this young person apparently did not take upon themselves to get better and to want to keep playing J. B. as a junior is to take away the same opportunity from those younger players that was the forward it to him\nAs he was supposed to be taking working on his game and what you rape is what you do

today a scribe an Oscar and uh the Houston multifamily mentor and sky to but we left I left you a question here that was a basically have six months a year ago you were taking your foot off the gas\nAnd starting to pump the brakes and now all of a sudden you got it shifted into high gear hear what's going on does change\nYou know the uh I I think I've heard you use this phrase it and it's very true the thing that can keep a lot of people away from a great life as having a really good one\nAnd I think ah when you and I had that conversation I was having a very good life I um [noise] you know I was always pretty financially conservative and getting out of college at twenty\nTwo twenty three years old I Would get money magazine and read it cover to cover the day it showed up I Do all the little worksheets that they put in there on how much money you need to retire and all that sort of stuff and [noise]\nAnd my first job out of college I immediately went after Eighteen percent I was donating to the four oh one K. to really get ahead of that thing I didn't believe Social Security was going to be around and I wouldn't count on at forty five years later [noise]\nUm and I one of those worksheets set a number how much I needed to retire and a couple of years ago we refinanced my first two deals and had to sit down I only redo my personal financial statement or really look at all that stuff when they make me\nTo get a loan done and I did my a deal in a way you know what\nI'm over my number now what do I do [laughter] do I quit or I'm too young really to to totally quit but you know these things will keep throwing off cash flow for as long as I keep them and I thought\nNow's the time to start focusing on the lifestyle issues and stop worrying about money or so I really didn't have a need for more deals I didn't need them to feed my ego I didn't need them to feed my my family\nOr anything like that and I also at that same time two years ago I had my first two I have twins and a there'll be juniors and college and a couple of weeks here [laughter] uh but they got into college and I realized it didn't hurt me as bad as I expected it to\nUm having that extra money going out ah so ah so I really\nI I was wondering what I Do next what would I Do for an encore and uh [noise] at some point and this really a leads into why Mitt lifestyles now back\nAround New Year's I'm not a big New Year's resolution guy um but I had said you know what I Need to ... and\nIt just so happened about that time a a deal kind of fell into my lap that's the one I did back in April and about the same time John Ridgway came to me and said hey I'm moving up to support this national effort that lifestyle is going to have your taking my job [laughter] and I don't know if you know this but I turned him down twice\nA day when he came to me no I didn't know what I meant yeah\nAnd then he eventually sick Curtis on me and and you do know that Curtis when I started in the gallery of pretty much together about the same time so we used to have lunch once a week and compare notes and help each other out and uh we haven't been doing that he's got busy doing his thing and and doing the lifestyle mentor thing as a I don't know Eighteen months or two years ago when he took the shop\nAnd uh I got to do in my ideal and Curtis called me and said come on man I'll be like old times I Need your help [laughter] so ah he's the one that really convinced me to to take the position [noise]\nAnd uh yeah it's it's just been a real commitment and um and at the same time I'm doing more of the things that I Know that I used to enjoy helping people tending road trips things like that I'd kind of falling off the\nMap or for the lifestyles are things for a while there and\nIt's got to be reinvigorated re involved and ah and deals are coming to me so it's not like I'm really out there looking for them it's just that being more active again things kind of pop up\nAnd I just had my eyes open and you know decide which ones you wanna do\nAbsolutely now I Want to throw in another ... along those same lines and\nI'm going to put words in your mouth and nose when sanitary but look at it from this point of view about the time that all this came about you found this deal out of eased back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country\nAnd then the concept came to his for the first time ever to you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas and I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units I'm not going to guess but it's a lot of properties a lot of units\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all the taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would it be like to take the money\nAnd sophistication and the experience that we'll be cumulative in this group and taken some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or without being insulted elites they have less experience than we do\nAnd to be able to throw that these properties in these markets outside of the Texas market area\nAnd ah you nailed one we've had four or five others have gotten nailed and the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it\nIs it instead of people coming to row troops in Houston people are flying out of Houston and Dallas in San Antonio and going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to things and going to ah you know all these different places we had these deals\nAnd they're now saying we opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I you know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated to get\nIt absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right and my wife and I are first two and a
