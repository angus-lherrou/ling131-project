the shooting Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend left eleven people there are six other people heard there's Tanya Jay powers\nJust among the congregants killed at a shooting sense so slowly and we've just seen too much of it and and then also we always get the predictable\nYou know wealth gun issues I listen to me we've had too many shootings at schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting in history of the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now\nRetired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school\nAnd that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about the gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter\nWould you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals in that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's ... it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect and in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not a big story of the day the saddest thing I watched all we got to watch very closely and even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know I'm just shaking my head because people obviously know nothing about me\nThey do nothing about you know they don't take the time the either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to this program you\nKnow we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs\nIn Washington confronting bidding at senator is not letting them closed doors there\nWe've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality is caught and we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders and her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walking to an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell haven't as his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it it's we've got these everybody's got to stop\nNow we've been talking about the rhetoric we heard Hillary you can't be civil kick them Eric Holder and talking about Maxine Waters a lot\nYou know if you see these cabinet members you get a crowd well what does she thinks going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow them into restaurants and the department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted any anywhere anymore\nWell how is that going to end well\nTold the story when I met senator what's that guy's name from Connecticut again\n... looming ball when I was coming out there was it was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation I invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know if we're thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there\nThat we have you know all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life and even if it's being spend to silence made you know what I still believe in freedom\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that when President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happen\nWe've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at a time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us and at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box\nBut you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch\nThe Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre on President Trump look if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country\nCan chronicle it\nYou can watch it they don't see it which is sad their abuse and they're biased and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they live and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter those guy Rodney ... hours by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact\nThat President Trump and I think he can make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then the this killer lamenting there's there's no ... as long as there's a you know\nBad word of a quote infants the infestation but despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted that the president words matter silences complicity what is he talking about Paul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman tweeting a link to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do with Trump\nOh no it's unbelievable how they now have you know believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column in the Daily Caller today and he's been a a\nPassionate defender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison\nThis is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd he went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Eric ... they hid the picture for eight years\nShame on him now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with ... shame on him\nHe tell us and joins with Farah ... Khan one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nThe Pittsburgh master comes just two weeks after Farrakhan you know called Jewish Americans termites and that's mild compared to the the anti Semitism anti Semitism in the past and is that racism as well\nYou know this is rarely bashing Trump painter Linder SARS sore after the ... massacre in Pittsburgh we're hearing renewed calls to have a national conversation\nWell as long as we don't overlook some of the obvious suspect\nYou know if you look at some of the the the history now the Democratic party that don't seem to be the supporters of Israel they once were and it's not limited just the Farrakhan you know you have Palestinian activists Linder source or well known that\nYou know she was a a lead organizer of the anti Trump woman's march where but Don has said she dreamed of an awful lot about blowing up the White House was not so well known as the association that many prominent elected Democrats have what's our store\nYou know and and just the last year

vows to vote to slash aid to Israel when she gets in Congress and August Bernie Sanders was campaigning weather and we're beginning to see something here is democratic candidates increasingly\nYou know they're they're being seen with the most radical types of if it was if it was Trump I can assure you there'd be a lot of people speaking out\nOr we have a lot more to talk about we'll talk about how you know Fox is under fire I'm under fire how never Trump or is it just so bitter and angry that they can't stand how wrong they were they they want to do everything possible to align with the most radical elements in the Democratic party\nThe Democratic drinking we must die when you vote for Republican Congress how President Trump congressman Kevin McCarthy and\nHouse Republicans build the

Trump\nIs too big facts getting in the way all the Republican Party rejects anti Semitism out of hand it's it's the Democratic party leaders I never get in a rural what Louis Farrakhan unless I was going to get into the grill and drill him about his anti Semitism and his racism\nThe shooter this guy Bowers despised President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish\nAnd and so on and so forth you know apparently a you know as Ron ... rightfully said oh this weekend on Fox News that you know these very ill and anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the persecution that has taken place in this was something that the president rice the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years\nWe've read it we studied it they've gone through it all and we still see so much of it it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary\nAll these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel or president said we will see their destruction\nWhich is standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism\nIn oh Sarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump\nThe evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nWe haven't had a president in modern history that has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel in the middle east ever and what an act of courage it was apparently but there's other presidents have promised it

in every way but on paper those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states punt detected undocumented unchecked circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently and walk away or the become immigrants\nReal reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earn citizenship\nAll right no news roundup information overload our eight hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nUh a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border not download fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear that that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed\nThe only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping a finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program sir glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column midnight I haven't read the whole column ... my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the Mark I'm in the actually good actually no great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks from my party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to uh overthrow the constitution to make himself all presidents for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our will and organizing a posting videos pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic American sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in\nWe just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself and don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity as mounting to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humbling according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with that one of the sun shine we don't want anybody hurt and also it has undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to I'm again I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply lose HUD really as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side and Mexico I saw nothing but poverty\nI saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even\nAnd then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there as things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people but\nWe can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way and it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nWithout question of what you just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border\nThat we are supposed to allow three to ... billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion\nObviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of horrible yeah\nAll right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine for one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program we got to take a break up much of the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four oh one case that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com they're going to make it simple for you to do your part now you can mail make calls and emails tax\nKnock on doors help neighbors get to the polls go to a big choice election dot com because the only way we lose this year is if you don't show up if you don't turn out go to big choice election dot com do your part\nAnd let's not get out worked in November big choice election dot com will come back more your phone call straight ahead eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number [noise]\nI ever get out of a media man room\nSean\nHannity show one thousand [noise]\nOklahoma 'cause that readers named CBD plus usa okay see number one source for CBD for Oklahoma owned and have a one hundred percent money back guarantee plus first on customers commitments that are half off the for profit CBD plus usa lip best life\nToday we're talking to a doctor or a copy of universal men's clinic about ...

already knows Simon I approve this message\nGlad you're with us twenty five now till the top of the hour a there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point it's actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words there are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians sentiment could be beating as well how she was up at three in the latest poll is beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even tie forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida\nRhonda Santas is coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his\nThe latest habit now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll of West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seeing is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise is not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say this shot first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to feed the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple what we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got British sent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing in the case of Tennessee got reticent staff calling the people Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day are Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can't see past are angry at least Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixteen when the media had two snares out there\nOne of the best the best case if Hitler and one in the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that to two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten to ... mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase to regulate its watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean
