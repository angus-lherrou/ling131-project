Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber to our own words that she was ... it quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow your classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapist of teenage girls will give me the evidence in cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not don't yeah I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week\nWait a minute what everybody's talking\nIt was a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I Know and the FBI added\nNo excuse me why every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed\nDozens of people and then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick all third shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drugging of women so could you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not saying then it gets to a guy that I don't expect that you went extinct and I did\nBut I Know you're following of the ... you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite occur operation people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happened that way at all\nSo the charges are college roommate in the ... the last twenty four hours at looking about ah the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show they sound like it or something\nOf course I Believe and the and the and the presumption of innocence but also to leave that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing itchy out hey\nI Know I'm just not talking what what was on a second I Want you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one I witnessed says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do is we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nTo see what else can they pass certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when I don't know huh\nOK okay ... thanks the fact that she doesn't run into where I where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you know you're you're trying to what you're trying to change it look follow the bounds of the people\nIf there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know how she got home\nWe don't even know the house but you mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of felony all said that didn't happen the way she said\nOne witness that didn't happen and my question is what the FBI do if they don't know the location that can't be looking parenthetically for anything quick break we'll come back more with Jonathan Gillum and Daniel McLaughlin here on the Sean Hannity show\nHey I Want to talk about your whole security protecting your family that's simply St Paul security the best security system on the market even said by the net PC Magazine a wire cutter is their top pick for home security and there's a good reason when they

afford to not let the credit card companies make you think that you have to pay it all back\nBecause you don't what the credit card companies don't want you to know is that there's actually a way to get debt free without paying off your entire debt or going bankrupt if you have five thousand dollars or more and credit card debt you know have the right to let a subtle that debt for a fraction of what you will for free information called debt free dot com now\n... not by the FBI should we should the FBI now investigate them if this is the new standard Jonathan\nNo because that's our authority that those are local crimes that happened now the case of we need to Robert do however um he that would've been a state matter because that the time a Bill Clinton was the attorney general\nYou know and so but here's the thing that you keep saying and Daniel ... here's what you keep missing and so many people that are emotionally involved with this if you take the emotion out of it I Know that's difficult because people are very passionate but if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative facts there are none\nAnd there's not going to be any because it doesn't matter who you question the very people that are the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime don't know anything\nAnd so if you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or heard here say it becomes here say you know that from being in court that\nWhen you have a just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence\nThe case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally and the the the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for a political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is the that's the thing that took ... I'm a governments do\nLook look I agree I think that one thing that's important to cut back to this was a standard here this is not\nA criminal investigation out this is an investigation into conduct that may or may not have bearing on way that somebody gets a lifetime appointment um and I understand and I read this account extremely political and extremely emotional and I think that's partly because\nAnd yelled snake ... question do you have any corroborating witness for any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat isn't on the question that as an unseen\nReally I got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... ... I I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is I Want you to make question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there's no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passionate about something if somebody says\nWhat other information do you have that's legitimate question because there is not and the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have ... ... it would be them\nRight and on the side there is no robbery evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with the he was there and I think I think people are emotional for for ...\nAnybody actually has a copy of is summer calendar that year but we don't have an exact day anyway so\nRight right and you know what you're saying is that you know he has to prove his innocence or is the innocent before proven to be ... they haven't been proven guilty what what do you believe in is innocent until proven guilty again this is great so he hasn't been proven guilty and you know has he he has not been proven guilty and it's gone on a long time\nNot to a legal standard that would be her quite well absolutely not but I don't believe that at the stand if yeah and I write\nThank you both we appreciate

hasn't had time to read it Democrats in an uproar angry upset lashing out at the FBI\nWhat were they supposed to do except to interview the people that was supposed to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever going to be enough All right back to our phones as we say Hi Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up in spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday challenge\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a secret people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nShocking statement that he may was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had ... not um and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know his own mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you know look at him and uh you'll find that funny Sean but we were actually related or I think it for three or four generations back a great great something grandfather he was actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought\nYou would really love to know somebody told me that yesterday on my record with really\nNo there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like\nUm I Hope it goes the right thing if any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delight they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations\nAnd they're not going to offer opinions here and all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what it was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it's it is so ... it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that's ... that's why to the extent that people can literally destroy other people with a new window falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh\nThey do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their playbook I don't know I um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some point we may need to say\nIf you're going to make these girl is accusations against individuals you better be able to prove it because if you can't prove it then you ought to be held financially liable because", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "04"}
