with me I have raised Walker ray is the director of Medicare assistance or at your office is over at the Oklahoma department of insurance\nYes that is correct\nOr we are you know involved in helping people getting their Medicare decisions made there's going to be some changes coming up in two thousand Nineteen\nUh I think I sent you that information as a matter of fact one of those is going to be with the Medicare Advantage plans you know they they currently can offer some extra benefits like dental and and hearing and in vision and stuff well they're going to expand it see a message they could actually offer some more supplemental benefits and\nWhen last I heard about forty percent of those plans are actually going to start offering some of those additional benefits in two thousand Nineteen it may be something as simple as nicotine replacement patches you know to help someone stopped smoking\nBut it could also be things like adult day treatment or adult dates are\nValid yesterday carry something that really interests me yet has we have a great community here it provides that serve\nBut it's not cheap so this would be an additional benefit that would help cover that you know other than that someone might have to use like long term care insurance or something to get that kind of assistance\nThis would be an opportunity for someone to have that it also one of the other options that they have is to offer transportation no it's not going to be a benefit that everybody you know you still have to qualify for it in other words it's not going to be like you just don't feel like driving that day so you know call a taxi or something it would be for someone who can't drive themselves or something like that so\nThat's another thing that's going to be changing the other thing for people who are on Medicare Advantage plans they're going to extend the time period during which you can make those changes currently\nYou've got October Fifteen through December seventh as the open enrollment period when you can make any changes you want with your a Medicare Advantage plan or drug plan\nBeginning in two thousand Nineteen they're going to have the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period that's going to go from January first through march thirty first that\nIs for people who are already on a Medicare Advantage plan\nAnd maybe they want to change to a different Medicare Advantage plan or maybe they want to get off of the Medicare Advantage plan to go back to her original Medicare and get a party drug plan so that time period will allow them to make one change and that's going to begin in two thousand Ninety I so we've got some significant changes that are going to be taken\nYou and I are going to be really really busy from October the fifteenth through march the thirty first yes and you know you talked about the changes for Medicare Advantage at that time of the year [noise]\nUm I had an issue with the lady that I met at airports villa\nOr this week and she retired from the Methodist conference\nIn July of two thousand nine eleven she turned sixty five in July of two thousand nine and uh I notice when I was running her um her Medicare part D she was paying a penalty mhm on her drug plan and I said ma'am\nYou were on the great coverage with a Methodist conference yes ma'am I was until Monday are retired and I said well why are you paying a penalty she says that gun they're fine now nobody would help me out with that\nGood luck with the problem the problem is that when they retire and they get enrolled in a party drug plan there is a form that they've got to fill out\nThat establishes when they had drug coverage and what the last day that drug coverage was as long as the person obtains creditable drug coverage within sixty three days of the termination of that group coverage they don't pay a penalty and so apparently she didn't get that form a filled out so she can get to your Social Security\nOkay so that was in two thousand eleven I'm getting excited about this conversation [laughter] he's now two thousand eight team if we get that form filled out for her show and she had credible coverage was she get a refund on other than\nThat would be a question for Social Security oh I don't know about that I don't know if there's a time limit that you have to get that form turned in by a but I Would say at the very least she can get the the penalty eliminated so she doesn't have to continue that\nWell that's something to work on because and that's just things we noticed because I'm a law and he went from group to Medicare you shouldn't have a penalty\nOr it gets very confusing and a lot of times employers don't realize what their responsibilities are about informing or their previous employees of what they need to take care of where the vets for their part B getting enrolled in part because you know they don't have to take out part B if they're still working if they've got creditable coverage through their employer\nThey can hold off on getting their part B but it's important that they get enrolled in part B when that group coverage or terminate so that the health coverage\nAnd I hate to stop us
