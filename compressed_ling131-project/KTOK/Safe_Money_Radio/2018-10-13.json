downturns are temporary the bull markets continue forever or you do not even think about the risks\nEither way danger lies ahead Taleb a argues that the markets do not factor interests that are not measurable and that and most of the really big events in our world are rare unpredictable and not measurable\nThese advanced when that happened usually have a very significant downward impact on the investment markets are you probably remember what happened um on nine eleven of two thousand one\nTotally unpredictable\n[noise] but this was one of the of the very big reasons why we spent so much time encouraging you to get off of that train and shift the risk to someone else\nShift the risk to whom we work with a billion dollar companies that will take the risk off of your shoulders and

as the standard example of a scientific truth the equivalent today might be the earth rotates around the sun today we'd call that an indisputable scientific truth\nSo what were the odds of seeing a black swan at that time\nWell impossible to calculate but uh considered impossible until sixteen Ninety seven when explores found black swans and Australia imagine that they had a black swan event finding black swans in Australia when that was considered impossible\nAs I mentioned earlier we had a black swan event in two thousand one didn't wait [noise] and we're having many others these

some other friends on the media telling them to work hard and put their money in a mutual fund diversify and everything will be okay\nWhat failed is a promise that never should have been made\nYou

is one of the largest purchases they will ever make\nWhat risk do you have when you buy out for one\nYou have risk of market value lost\nA lot of people learned that in two thousand eight right many people thought that there was no significant risk from home values going down but that perception has now changed\nAnd what about risk of property loss flood fire and those dreaded earthquakes that we seem to have every five minutes around here when storms and that\nThere are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment other properties you don't have the same risks if you own a car about an airplane\nIf you're on an airplane or about my condolences but anyway if you own any other property with significant value there is a risk of loss when you're on something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you probably know the answer insurance right\nInsurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they were probably never used so why\nWould you buy insurance on your home you might say well I have a loan on my home so I have to buy insurance on it well that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for would you still buy insurance I think you probably would why\nWhether you realize it or not you would buy insurance on your home because of something called catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that you have a chance even if it a small to lose a lot of value in other words money\nIf something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our homes is because the cost of insurance is very small\nCompared to the last we might incur if a catastrophe happens so for the fun of it let's let's assume you live in a modern home up to current building 'cause you don't smoke and fall asleep in your bed you don't light candles and leave them unattended\nAnd you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen if I'm describing you there's a very small chance your house is going to catch on fire even so I bet you have home insurance and the reason is because losing your house\nWould be a catastrophic financial last so the relatively small cost of homeowners insurance is worth paying for am I right well you know I'm right\nBut let me ask you another question why don't you have insurance on your retirement money shouldn't you\nShouldn't you call us now for free copy of are a hundred and Fifteen page save money book\nSo I can tell you how to ensure your retirement against market loss\nThrough strategy called no market risk retirement planning give me a call anytime at
