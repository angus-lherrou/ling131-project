{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "Of trinity legal and thank you so much for coming in today Laurie but you have brought one of the volunteers and\nWe have Jeff crane with crane and associates your office is located in Edmond\nYes no Oklahoma City you're right out there and that cool area forty five hundred memorial circle real easy to find good morning counselor for more than ... well tell me um how are you affiliated with trinity legal\nSure I'm One of the forty or so volunteer attorneys\nOthers to commit some time once a month or so or to handling some of the ... the trinity sponsors throughout the city or a we have six or so different locations currently uh the one that I serve it is a crossings community center just south of the girls and I do that about once a month\nOkay and what are some of these services that you provide when you're talking to a client\nWell we have all kinds of issues like Lori mentioned uh many of those were family issues my practice symbol states and elder care a law are trained to handle some of the probate orange the planning a adult Gordon ships and other issues that are facing older citizens\nMhm how rewarding and sent for warnings were pilots with my weight\nI'm going to nail you how much do you make an hour while I currently charge to Seventy five an hour for most of them were guy so if you worked there for hours when you volunteer okay spot for its I'm happy to do it I sort of assume it's a further ministry that from sports\nWell and and I tell people all the time we all have these wonderful talent because what you do I couldn't do okay so those of us that have more need to step up and do more it's biblical like Lori said there's over two thousand scriptures in the Bible that talks about justice\nI think I'm going to print 'em off and send them to Congress okay and Laurie didn't tell me to say that that was totally shoot from the hip from your from your host but seriously we get back to the basics of life and if we would do that more often\nUh it'd probably be it'd probably be easier but you're helping a group of people\nThat really can't help themselves right Jeff\nIs absolutely are a lot of the times require it comes and they don't know what they don't know they're just trying to untangle the mess that's been presented to them we can't afford legal services and they just need someone to ... to them and so a lot of times we provide\nGuidance and advise sometimes we don't continue on as their attorney in there to\nDo you actually go to court just one of ... we have several cruises a probe leader guardianship Greece's handling the last few years where we go to court with the court that we've just seen a few weeks earlier in the clinic and we handle all aspects of World War two young for them\nAnd they get the same service as somebody sitting next to him that is paying their attorney to walk in\nThe absolute lead the ethical standards require that we provide her with a professional services whether they're in ...\nSo justice is not blind it his equal but I say that well I was\nWondering if the wind any growth [laughter] well you know I've heard\nToo many times have people that got accused got sentence and it was simply because they didn't have the money so what is it they say the ... just take the best deal on the table and then they find themselves in prison we got a huge problem here in Oklahoma\nWith grandparents raising grandchildren uh our prisons are busting at the same\nSo I'm just kinda sitting over here in the corner thinking that maybe the service that trinity legal provides the forty attorneys that come in pro bono y'all might be plugging some of those holes in the dike among throw that to you Laurie\nOh absolutely and I think the last number that I heard and this was just a couple of weeks ago is that our Oklahoma county jail which is often housing people who are are simply awaiting trial on there were Nineteen hundred people house there um and\nAnd the capacity at that jail is how much twelve hundred twelve hundred so we would say busting at the same as as an understatement that's correct that's correct and again\nWe we definitely need more people who are are there to help provide that assistance to people who can't afford it and people are just struggling between the fines that they need to pay 'em to hire counsel\nUm and to just take care of the things that they need and that's just that the initial problem as you've already pointed out there are um\nThere are other problems that stems from that than um such as that guardianship um ended up problems because as many of the people who then are in jail\nOr how families yeah so there are children then they're going to be taken care of slant\nA Seventy nine year old grandma that has the great grandchildren yet or two and five we hear those stories here in Oklahoma and my hat's off to the grandparents because they're not going to put them in the chest\nThank you thank you but we've still got the other problems on how can we help them walk the journey let's give your website out\nThat would be trinity legal dot org\nOkay and you have several areas where you provide service\nThrough the community one is that the crossings community clinic and it's just a south of Hefner and pan brand new ... community it's on the west side of the street you can see the sign it's really easy to wreck in your eyes but you're also in about five or six different locations\nThat's correct we're in six that total so process community clinic is one of them the city rescue mission is another crossing crown ministry Salvation Army and Norman is our first Cleveland county clinic that we has opened\nAnd also okay see first church in ... is our newest partner location and living faith ministry\nOkay it's another and living face ministry as a ministry that also started at crossings and that is a bridge out of prison to to take the next step in your life\nAnd you make such a good point there and that's the reason that we partner we want to take a holistic approach to the legal services that we all ... and many times are clients have more needs than just their legal needed set aside for example at the city\n... mission they're ... they're\nExperiencing homelessness and at the mission they're able to um have housing and food and go through the programs that they offer they are to treat addiction and or any number of other things and job training and things like that and I step in and provide the legal help that they need in any case this well my hat's\nOff to you and it's always an honor on well preserved\nTo bring these services to the community because even though I'm In I'm an independent insurance agent we get a lot of phone calls from this because I Do speak a lot in the community so if I can tell ten or Fifteen thousand on Saturday morning instead of one of the time that's what I call a yuppie\nSo thank you for coming in today Lorrie thank you for inviting me absolutely and that is trinity legal dot org their local phone number is four oh five for one of four or five four four\nThank you Jeff crane for coming in boomer senior we're going to kick it today in Texas yes\nWe don't want to hear the orange burned do we [laughter] not at all and I'm just\nPraying for Arkansas might Ghana and we're going to make it

Saturday\nAnd four o'clock on Sunday afternoon the tickets are only Fifteen dollars great program\nYou have risk of market value lost\nA lot of people learned that in two thousand eight right many people thought that there was no significant risk from home values going down but that perception has now changed\nAnd what about risk of property loss flood fire and those dreaded earthquakes that we seem to have every five minutes around here when storms and that\nThere are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment other properties you don't have the same risks if you own a car a boat an airplane\nIf you're on an airplane or about my condolences but anyway if you own any other property was significant value there is a risk of loss when you're on something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you probably know the answer insurance right\nInsurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they were probably never used so why\nWould you buy insurance on your home you might say well I have a loan on my home so I have to buy insurance on it well that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for would you still buy insurance I think you probably would why\nWhether you realize it or not you would buy insurance on your home because of something called catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that you have a chance even if it a small to lose a lot of value in other words money\nIf something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our homes is because the cost of insurance is very small\nCompared to the last we might incur if a catastrophe happens so for the fun of it let's let's assume you live in a modern home uptick current building 'cause you don't smoke and fall asleep on your bed you don't light candles and leave them unattended\nAnd you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen if I'm describing you there's a very small chance your house is going to catch on fire even so I bet you have home insurance and the reason is because losing your house\nWould be a catastrophic financial last so the relatively small cost of homeowners insurance is worth paying for am I right well you know I'm right\nBut let me ask you another question why don't you have insurance on your retirement money shouldn't you\nShouldn't you call us now for free copy of
