would happen to you know the shift mar the growing to other parts where they can still get good yields but so what's been the reaction out of other people outside of the study\nYou summarize the beer industry is ... pretty nicely yeah they said were on top of this thing there was a drought in the Pacific northwest last year that affected probably production\nAnd so we're all aware of this and worrying about it and that's all nice but some of the people who look at sort of large scale farming say that you know these are changes are going to be happening on continent wide scale and that is going to affect crops when you have drought and heat wave we can engineer\nFor things like drought resistance but that actually might change the nutrient profile of the barley which might change the taste of the beer\nOr you know it's what's in it and you can editor for drought resistance but he resistance is a tough one and he is the thing that's going on what time of climate change and that might change these very basic chemical reactions that are going on in our early that my\nEarly early and so that's why you have to move it or a farmer than you know you run out of north after a while and it becomes more expensive to do that sort of thing you're competing with other crops\nSo the people who study these things on an ... culture economic basis or not as sanguine as the industry on the other hand you know people like beer in the industry is pretty innovative won in some way so you know maybe they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry about it\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer at one of the authors of the study even said not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitions air pollution death anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're messing with my beer and you know everybody's interested in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nIt's all this month of October I've been putting in little stories and the podcast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level of Halloween that I Love to get every year the one that caught my attention this past week\nWas that every child vampire burial that was found in Italy in some type of baby cemetery\nThere was this eerie discovery ... they found it was the skeleton of a ten year old that had a rock lodged in his mouth they buried this child is way because they were afraid it was gonna come back to life and continue to spread malaria I spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this vampire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university to Stanford\nWent on this dig in Italy and they found this\nChild cemetery and so inside of a miniature him in what used to be a gigantic\nRoman villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall if you can think about it like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with its mouth open and stuffed inside was a limestone rock\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said they believed that child\nDied as malaria\nSixty miles north of round and they said that\nThe way that they buried this catalyst they ... they ... already dead they opened the mouse forcefully shoved the rock inside and then failed that extra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the rock wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead because of those same impression right locally or they're calling it the vampire of little nano it's in this like you said is in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called ... de ...\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in this very will say you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of a ... in these trenches they're dirt coverage trenches\nThere was remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents total bones ROMs called dreams these things were filled with ash and sacrificial puppies\nYeah archaeologist call these deviant burials which is the ancient way of burying people who were they feared would have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead or that the where people and I I don't know how this would apply to children but that had violated society's rules and the name of empire ...\nAnd a lot of these archaeologists and researchers saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know what it was or why it was popping up\nAnd things that they feared they thought might come back from the day that thought they were of empires that's why they took these extra steps to bury them this way so that they couldn't come back and continue to spread diseases\nAnd they would do all kinds of things like that were ... rituals I'd really he didn't say they would dump honey suck all all over the place and these were just to kind of try to make it as your as possible so that these spirits would just pass along and not come back\nWe don't know the gender of this ten year old the skeleton that was there but they said that near this one was a three year old girl the the remains were thrilled girl they found\nThat said there her hands and feet had been way down with stones which was another form of vampire burial to keep the evil away so that she couldn't get up they were able to dig in into the bones and the remains and they also found that she had died of malaria\nAnd they're saying that the reason why there are so many children's bodies that they had done extensive research on to find out yeah they all died for malaria is because it's Roman Empire section was considered to be assessed pull of diseases and they spread it through\nContaminated food and water and it was pretty swampy so there are a ton of mosquitoes and that's why there was so much malaria up until they pretty much figured it out in the Eighteen hundreds\nThis is not the only sight of these quote unquote vampire\nBurials yeah in northern Italy there was a woman who's buried with a brick in her mouth almost the same thing like the ... you know a shape rock but this was a British huge too you know she was dubbed the vampire of Venice and England there was another guy who had his tongue taken out and replaced with a stone\nSo it just seemed like that was one of the populace methods are popular rituals to keep them from being able to come back from the\nDay but that guy in England is fascinating because clearly in the year two hundred these people are talking to each other so somewhere these people in England new to do this exact same type of ... and the people in northern Italy or doing at the same time\nYeah it's interesting just what people will do when you fear or something you don't know how to control or react to it you go through these extra steps these rituals and label them which isn't vampires and things like that so\nIt's just pretty creepy that they would do that to a small child but when you're scared of something you're going to do those extra steps to protect yourself making random thank you ask her [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAll right that's it for us this weekend [noise] be sure to check out the daily diving every Monday through friday [noise]\nJoined us on social media\nReally dive pot on Twitter daily die park has some basic [noise]\nLeave us a comment give us a rating and tell us the stories that you're interested [noise]\nAll of the daily diving I heard radio subscribe wherever you get your pocket [noise]\nThe daily died was produced by random er into an engineered by Tony soaring Tina\nI'm Oscar mares in Los Angeles and this was your daily dive weekend [noise]\nMostly not ... on the phone that one of my family ...\nSeven seven seven votes out or if I'm voting hours at a local and some of whom are wholesome by setting a website for Apple's like time\nDuring early voting ... hanging harmful for\nThat and this week in twenty fourteen you two front man ... said he was sorry after their latest album was automatically added to the library's them all I tuned users\nAround the world saying the move was a drop of megalomaniac and a touch of generosity high tunes users complained that the eleventh songs that they've added to their music lottery without permission and that it was not clear how to delete them it was a rare symbol for Apple can use to\nTheirs are backing\nEverything into the trust to\nTake care of your assets take care of your property if you become disabled\nBut also at that time comes where you pass away that uh there is a simplicity and transferring the title and where it goes\nSo it's really a mechanism or vehicle to try to reach your objectives reach your goals with regards to your state plan as opposed to a will or not having anything which is the worst possibility\nAnd then you would have to go through the court process the probate process which isn't necessarily bad in Oklahoma and the trust really became popular in New York and California because they're probably process is which is awful\nI shouldn't say awful just a very good but Oklahoma's not bad but yet uh the trust in many cases can be particularly helpful to facilitate it\nI Know we've had a a you know make Neal and the state sales snap nickname McNeil and one of the things that he said one of the seminars and we were doing together was was simply made his job easier because with the trust you could have that estate sell\nQuickly quicker and with more certainty than if you had to go through ... and then go through the process of having the court to prove the sale and what happens to the proceeds\nWell we're going to have a little contest I've got a certificate for free lunch at ... and if you cannot ah look up and tell me approximately how many [noise] people Americans die with out a whale\nThat that's the question that's the question what is the first right answer a number or percentage\nWell a percentage I Would think will be a yeah\nOK number would have to have a timeframe right yes so what what percentage of people in America or in Oklahoma die without a whale south got go to your source Mr Google and figure it out right you're right [laughter]\nUm so\nOnce you create ... and I'm going to throw something else out there a reason to create a trust is maybe to keep your affairs more private\nThat is true because of trust many times are remote and especially most of the trust that I create our private trust\nThere is a provision in them that they shall remain private the terms private sometimes you have a blended family sometimes you have family members that you don't want them to know what's going on much less the entire world so you have a provision in the trust that it's to remain private\nAnd no one is to know what's in it the beneficiary can find out what they get but they can't find out what another beneficiary gets things of that nature so and if you look at\nUh like these popular entertainers prince Aretha Franklin any of those who passed away and and and without a trust their assets are all out there for the public to see and everybody looks at it and cut us elevate says to see well what do they have and and who are there\nReal children and and things like that and we're\nWe're all nosy to that extent that and so this keeps that out of the picture it keeps your privacy plus you can create more than one trust and you could have a trust that puts a fundraiser assets to a different a couple of charities or to\nOr some other individuals and you don't want\nEverybody to know about that you don't want your children to know about that or or or your grandchildren know about that so you put that into a separate crust they should never know about that\nAre all they would know is what they received through the trust that they're a bit of fishery other Vinnie\nAnd there there's many types have trust I Would assume about what we typically deal with a different set of trust in a living trust\nWell those are actually terms of art or in the sense that you look at a\nTrust that I'd create is a intervene ghost during my lifetime trust trust that that\nHas a a span when I'm Alive it is a certain way many times it's revolt couple where I can revoke it at any time sometimes I Would make an ear replicable which I Can't revoke it or change it at all it is what it is at that particular point\nThen there is a trust that is a testament or you trust that created\nAt death or as a result of a probate sometimes that is done were your will actually created trust to for example you have a minor or child who has special needs that they're receiving some kind of government assistance you want to try to protect\nThat run try protect them so you don't get a pile of cash just drop in their lap that they go spend on on frivolous things he tried to help them out\nSo you can have a test ... trust\nOr so you can have a different frightened types of trust and in that sense but they all basically come down to the same thing which is a vehicle to try to a manager your assets that are in the trust\nThat we want to talk about is what's in the trust and then what happens at certain conditions such as disability or death [noise]\nWe're going to talk about that when we return and the contest is how many people in Oklahoma or in the U.S die without a ... percentage of people out of power without a will and will return right after this

E. T. T. L. Anwar correct ... we're going to make at least three syllables out of anywhere [laughter] so I [laughter] subtler set\nAt anyone who has made it but not everybody has made a trust a but most people committed trust may see this word and wonder what in the world\nDoes this mean and I explained that in a second but subtler it generates from of course the word subtle se T. T. L. E. which comes from the old English which means to seat\nA CAT or to place so subtle or is one who places or in law law language one who makes a settlement\nAnd it's more commonly used as the person who creates or makes a trust in order makes a place for the property to be settled\nSo the subtle or many times you'll see this in a trust the subtler is the person who creates the trust and he didn't puts the property into the trust\nNow we've used varying other term sometimes who's grand tour sometimes we trust maker we used other kinds of terms but I see subtler a lot\nAnd I get wisdom out that all the time about what is this word means the subtler as one who makes the trust makes the set up in a place to put the property into\nSo is that the person that owns the trust or is that the person I don't trust you have the trust you have a trust you\nHave the trust the trust itself is created by individual\nAnd again we can get into ... but the subtler let's use that word or grant or if you want to use that word trust maker creates a trust you make a trust agreement then you have to have someone named in that trust\nTo operate the trust called the trustee\nThat person is appointed to do that you can have ... but then if that person cannot or doesn't want to for whatever reason you will have the secondary or successor trustee\nYou may have a trustee if the trust maker the subtler is disabled which case you have something called a disability trust the sometimes the exact same as the successor trustee\nAnd you will have the successor trust the than operate the trust because the trust itself sets up a an operation as to how the property used to be managed what powers the trustee has and doesn't have\nSometimes we have a situation where we even have companies and their trust companies who will oversee or operate the the trust as a trustee\nBut before you name a trust company you want to contact them they'll want to see the trust and see if they will accept this trust is something they want to take on they do charge a fee for that\nBut uh you want to make sure that you have someone who operates the trust the knows what you want and what you're trying to accomplish in that the terms are terms that\nThe trustee can actually operate under 'cause many times your terms have certain parameters and so settlers that person who makes the trust trust to use the person who then is responsible to oversee manager and operate the trust\n[noise] oh okay so there's a lot of moving parts to trust frankly\nThere are moving parts to it but\nIt is simplistic in the sense that\nIt is like like a a box or you've got a box that certain definitions certain size to the box certain ... certain deficit cetera and then what do you put in the box stuff you put in the property that you fund the trust what you put it in the box\nAnd then how you take stuff out or how do you move things around in that box are determined by the document the contract called the trust agreement\nAs to what can be done with the stuff that's in that box\nAnd the trustee is the one in charge for us to use the one in ... and the SAT or are sometimes not the same person\nUsually it starts out the ... are the same if I ... I put myself is trust you during my lifetime and while I'm confident but if I become disabled than someone else like you but you might be my disability trust or if I die that you might be my successor trustee", "station": "KTOK", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
