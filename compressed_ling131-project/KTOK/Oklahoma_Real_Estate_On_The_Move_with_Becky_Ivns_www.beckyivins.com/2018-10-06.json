{"year": "2018", "content": "Before they wreak havoc on the rest of the call anyone of that a pathogen is a fungus or some other sort of disease that the thing that has evolved over many millions of years and ants which then as you mentioned the fungus hassle\nThan skirt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around it somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume when smell a little different than a typical aunt so because they have\nThis really intricate unique system of missing out bad\nActors in the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out killing\nThe ants a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago this is in fact that they found fossils that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characteristic bite marks of the aunt in them which presume that the fungus had\nBeen doing this for a long time so it probably start out pretty sort kills the ... in the colony but that might get a found out in that would get dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where do you stick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article to it has to drive all its host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms in the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms and doesn't really show symptoms until it is literally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus ordering it to its doom up you know ten inches up a tree so you know this is as I mentioned this was an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem\nPossible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex\nBecause the ant colony is it self extremely complex and able to sniff out the sort of manipulation is the end is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball to avoid detection and really pull off this stunningly complex devious manipulation\nAnd that's how we get this zombie I mean here it's so delicate that process in infiltrating the colony and even half the time it right the you know the fungus has a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colony that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight the leaf and everything it's just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does ah originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in South Carolina I think uh we have at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe in all of them are incredible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ...\nTo bite onto the pain of all if that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above the colony so what has happened here in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is\nThe fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the vein of elite but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a perch that it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the tree the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a perch it's easier to get a purchase on the vein of elite by biting into it so it actually happens here in the United states is as the\nFungus there's ordering the ... to bite onto the flag it's not such a good purchase\nBut then it orders the answer rap its legs around the way and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that\nStamp and that's just all the more power to to purchase there and you know get a good grasp because in the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forest where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and it will\nOver winter just sitting there on the stem biting its time and then once the spring comes around or then finally arrived out of the back of the head\nOf the ... as it does in the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest a dozen and a number of days as opposed to once upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely adapted to really ruin the day of the aunts and in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead cells about the book\nYeah so that turns out that the fungus is just one of the\nMany many manipulators among parasites in the animal kingdom so it turns out that this is across different species so worms do it to crickets their war or to the crickets the jump into water which is not of course great for the credit which can drown or you can buy fish and it's at that point the worms are up and then ...\nThat's a particular kind of manipulation\nRabies actually is a very well known parasitic manipulated that does it usually to raccoons and ... and things like that but can also get into the human brain so\nThe book is about the wide range of parasites the\nReally incredible range of parasites more than you'd ever imagine that can take over the minds of their hosts and really unique ways whether that's by releasing chemicals or physically altering\nStructures in the brain so it's called the living dead and yes it's it's a what I Hope they're fascinating exploration hope is very strange kingdom of species that are really ruining the days of their house\nJust reading about the ants in of itself is so interesting so thank you very much Matt Simon staff writer at wired author of plight of the living dead check out the book thank you for joining us\n[noise]\nAll right that's it for us this weekend to check out the Daily Times every Monday to friday\nJoined us on social media daily diets pot on Twitter daily podcast on these\nLeave us a comment give us a rating tell us your story\nAnd by not putting more cabinets on the opposing wall on both opposing malls with the island and the metal so we just for go the cabinets on one run leave a straight run and with an island and sometimes we can accomplish a bigger island and the same amount of uh twelve eleven feet\nOh never even thought about doing that so that's a well and that's like on TV and HGTV thing where they just take out one of the walls and go with an island\nI was gonna say that [laughter] okay [laughter] so some people can't do that if it's an exterior wall obviously\nRight but I mean in interior wall I've\nSold a lot of homes that we had to get structural engineers on because people just took down the wall right right and then all of a sudden they couldn't understand why there she rocks church to crack because they've taken down load very mall all we have is saying at the office we've never met a wall we can't take ...\nOkay it just takes a little bit more\nStructural beams and things like that right yeah okay so the islands or in light fixtures that are different and an above the island\nIs where I've seen the most different light fixtures\nRight right and that's still very popular so um it without even seeing a kitchen a lot of times I can walk into the house and anticipate\nThree lights over the island or two lights over the islands for some reason\nAnd those whether it's two or three we've gotten away from the single light fixture over the island right so and I think it just gives more opportunity for the multiple light fixtures which I just think are appealing to people right now\nWell any good light Oh absolutely above all workspace her out one of the things I've seen Karen is that\nUh people putting candle lights in a kitchen but they will put them more toward the center and not right above the workspace oh sure and then that way there\nThe light literally cast a shadow their of their own head on the counter space so they can't see what they're doing\nWe move a lot of lights and remodeling a lot because they're the placement so critical and in the walk away it's not with a lifelong\n... need to be above the works by a car and yet kind of have to pay attention to how the doors open even on your cabinets to where it's not going to cast the shadow so um you did a thing for realtors at your office and you brought that to our attention and I've noticed that so much since then\n[laughter] so it's sometimes it's not great to know me going out all kinds of things that now you notice yeah well and and that\nIs ... has helped a lot of people I Will tell you because as people start saying well I Want to take off his recess lighting and I'm going to putting cans I'm going well let me show you where to put them yeah because otherwise they were just going to line them up kind\nOf a six feet apart down the middle of the room right and that was not the right thing to do now so beneficial let's talk about light fixtures for a minute I've noticed that the spherical light fixtures like a ball [laughter] are really popular right now what else is popular\nHonestly anything that clients finds visually appealing so some of the things we're doing our the brush brass\nLight fixtures um the small many pendant I'm like I Would just referred to where there are three we do those but they're not the most popular so\nI'm and I'm referring to like the glass many in it and that's that have color and I'm\nA friend of mine just got those yes she was shocked at the price amount and rock is really judge ordered three because she wanted to put them over breakfast bar and\nThey were more on a glass oh so you're the fall yes but they did they were like three hundred dollars peace or something like that at ... so she was kind of shocked when she had a four digit figure on her bills [laughter] any type of metal\nWe're finding that whether it's like a white with a brass rush brass interior more of a shade type a light fixture those were saying very popular and we've been looking at and entertaining some ceramic light fixtures which are kind of interesting little bit\nDifferent ceramic those things like that would be so happy that they are oh wow okay yeah but the ceramic is not a so they would cash like down I guess as to whether or not so much up\nWe'd ... correct we don't rely on him that light for good lighting that's always supplemented by down lights as well over an island\nOkay so just decoration correct subject Israel appealing very visually it feels like we're talking to Karen Black from eight Karen Black

the um wherewithal to pay attention to trends not only just in our region but throughout the United states in even nationally and being able to pick and choose what\nElements that we think will be relative to our area\nAnd how it can best suit our clients to keep them protected from things that are going out of style at warp speed\nOkay well and that's do you know I'm paralyzed by that fear [laughter] uh we're getting ready to redo our home\nAh sixteen years old [noise] uh\nWe loved it and we have loved it for sixteen years but since we did have a big English Mastiff dog\nFor most of all of those years while I'm it's time to redo the flooring and we no longer have our English mass stone or so yeah we've had a English Mastiff since Nineteen Seventy eight wow they're great big Los but it is like having a cow in your house about children\nThey're wonderful wonderful wonderful ah our kids love loved our pet dogs of course but uh at this point we're ready to replace flooring we're ready to kind of redo a little bit of the kitchen\nA and\nR master bathroom\nSo I thought OK I'll just go pick out some stuff oh my gosh [laughter] the thing is is the flooring it's big house so it's going to cost a lot of money ... and I don't want to pick the wrong thing so I'm sort of paralyzed by that fear and I would that surprised me about myself because\nI get to go see the latest and greatest homes with clients and so you would think that I Would be pretty comfortable with that mhm not right right you don't need it and twenty thousand dollars on the floor\nAnd you're going that's a lot of money and what if I picked the wrong thing so design for casting I'm not looking for a trend I wanted to be good for ten or twelve years right\nRight not four or five\n... ... depending on how long you plan to stay well we're going to stay in two years than we would be looking a more closely at the current trends\nUh-huh well but and I guess my style would be more of a traditional style that are really out off the wall style anyway so what are foreign trends\nTiles and engineered would still seemed to be I'm holding strong and and probably will for a really long amount of time\nAt it again no one shoot me but I'm the wood grain tiles I've always been\nA little leery of those just because I've seen so much come in and out of style so I'm even though I have used them I just tell people frequently that you know in ten or Fifteen Years we may be looking back at what grain tile and thinking\nWow this might have been you know that long term solution\nFor what I really wanted and just because what I've seen over the years as I think that our materials that are real natural made materials seemed to stand the test of time the longest\nThey may go out of style but they'll come back around so I think the pink marble if the fifties now pink marble or even the white marvels of the fifties now backing style and very popular the black marble of the sixties have come back and
