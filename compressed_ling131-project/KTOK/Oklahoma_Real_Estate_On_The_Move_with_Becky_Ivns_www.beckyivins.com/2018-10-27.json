say that it made a lot of sense to you and made a lot of sense to me too it's not that I ever thought about but whenever I heard that this was a popular place it spread ashes it was like oh of course people love going to Disneyland it makes sense that someone want to spend eternity there and when I started talking to the custodian to work in both parks\nThey told me Oh yes it's very much a thing they're always been these rumors about it but it does happen\nAnd it so much to the point that they have a code word for it or they say it's a habit cleanup so\nIf you are a worker who these what you suspect are human ashes maybe left on the seat of a ride or something like that you radio over and you say we have a habit clean up and that means\nYou need to grab the hyper allergenic vacuum because the custodians will then come by and if they do indeed identified the substance of human ashes they will suck 'cause I'm up in a vacuum and clean it up while everyone you know leaves the premises and\nGoes on to other rights before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually noticed that it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency\nWe were talking about a really quick about how much it makes sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like\nCan we stay here forever so it really means something to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading\nThese ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks and they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get\nCreative several of them smuggled the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I've talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's or in in the hotel bathroom into a pill bottle that she\nCould then smuggle past park security while others\nWill simply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a purse or an ... that that's gotten through security as well and then once they're inside if they want us to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the rights particularly dark so no one sees them other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of the park that doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who in two thousand nine for the ashes of her mother and at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn\nOutside Cinderella Castle and ran across the grass flinging them she ran and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her\nAnd I have photos of sit there and I just saw the you know so so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn ashes doesn't get noticed I mean I Can't imagine how many people do this\nAnd never get caught but you're right that in talking to custodians the consensus that I arrived at what did it happen about once a month\nBut I've heard stories of it happening more frequently heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I I think the park has says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing [noise] you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney so\nProbably we point of pride that you know at this point\nYeah it's a point of pride it's also I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and something that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved ones final wishes\nSo it was something that they were really touched by an and actually quite eager to share with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the spread these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gates [laughter]\nI Love the quote someone said that the hunted mentioned probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that's one of those places obviously we know the hundred mentioned ride is all about spooky and what not and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives the all new meaning you know the next time I'm going to be they're going to be like trying to look for human ashes there\nWell I take that as the ultimate compliment I mean I think the last I heard\nSo many examples that I can say safely say that human ashes have been spread all over these parks the haunted mansion is definitely the most popular destination but it's a small world also had quite a strong showing based mountain pirates of the Caribbean I mean\nReally if you think about it they're probably been human ashes spread there and I don't quite know why the ... the hunted Manchin is so I mean obviously it's on theme right for the practice but in talking to people who work in the hot I mentioned they describe just to sort of general obsession among certain fans\nWith the haunted mansion I also think that it's probably strategically a pretty good spot because it's very dark and there are a lot of places where you can sort of in conspicuously into it\nKnowing this now gives all these rides new meaning when they find ashes and they have to go through the process of locating it cleaning it up they'll close the rides and say they're closer technical difficulties and I've\nOnly I've seen rides closed for technical difficulties before could be something mechanical but this was also one of those other reason so what's that process when they identify what they think it is and then how do they go through about cleaning\nProcess that will kick start on rights like the haunted mansions so safe around comes around people leave and they see some what they think are are human ashes on the seats they will clear out the premises do radio over for a clean up\nThey often do you tell people that there are technical difficulties that they need to attend to and then they will head out fast passes\nTo people because you know you're standing in line for an hour and then suddenly they said\nThere I'd have to shut down and you have to leave you got to give them something else people are going to get upset so then the the vacuums come in and they suck it up you know in a manager will often ride the ride by themselves so that they can look and see like are there any ashes anywhere in the rye that we need to go in identifying and sweep up and then resume business\nA number of the people I spoke to also dumped ashes in the water of these ride like on pirates and on it's a small world so the water I think it's probably a pretty ... possible place to to discover it you're not going to see that especially in some of those darker rides\nYeah I mean it's a really fun read it's perfect for Halloween Eric ... reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us\nA thank you and if you do see any ashes on the hunter mansion please call me so I can do a follow up it definitely was a great thank you\n[laughter]\nThat's it for us this weekend he sure to check out the daily diving every Monday through friday joined us on social media\nAt nearly died pot on Twitter in daily podcast on

produced on random er into an engineered by Tony ...\nTime Oscar mares in Los Angeles and this was your daily dive weekend edition [noise]\n[noise] just like chatting with your twins\nWill just run away from the\nNo idea those or not they're true names\nTo see what happens next visit ... to read the exquisite court ruling adventure pieced together by John Shuster Shannon hailed Daniel Handler another popular author\nExplore new world read this exciting messages brought to you by the library of Congress and the ad council grandma\nOkay baby don't let me know that\nBut we it's time to reduce some of the space okay particularly the floors were redoing floors are are getting ready to go up because we had a mass just oh goodness\nAnd in a dog eat dog it was like a cow [laughter]\n[laughter] it was\n... around caught a like a kind of like a cow [laughter] but he's been gone now for about three years and it's time for us to do get\nOur floors for sure sure okay um and then our walls and then our counters and it's just it just kind of goes on and on shore and says no boss that it is yeah it is uh so\nWhat is trending in floors and what do you forecast ... for flooring\nUm well I think flooring the main thing is that it's terrible obviously you've kind of experience that was having dogs and kids and all of that I think you know once again beauty is great but if it's not going to last and it's kind of you at all\nSo I think choosing something that ... and wood floors are great because\nYou know they can be read them they can be refinish since the end it down and they can look brand new again so that's great and I love\nLooking at the older homes for that reason because they already have this lead floors in there it can keep that character\nAnd and the history of the home so I Love the wood floor\nAnd and then I'm also seeing some this trend of like pattern tile and it's usually not something you want to do in a big space so you don't want to like have it throughout your whole house 'cause that would be overwhelming um but like in a powder bath or and\nOr maybe a mud room or something like that using the patterns how has really been something that I'm popping up everywhere\nI see shut the kind of looks Moroccan to me yes mhm enough very I I think that in a gender twelve years we're going to be going oh that was done\nAnd we will have not seen it was definitely\nA trend that's not something that I I imagine we'll stay around for that\nLong yeah so do you when you forecast things and you kind of think well what will stay around ten years mhm what do you think that might be honestly\nThat's where I go back to the meaningful designed like we can do all sorts of that like you know black and white as a classic color scheme that's always going to look nice thing in you know clean and but as far as like a whole design concept I don't I don't really want to do trends I Want to do\nYou know what's going to be meaningful to this person so we're going to tell their story and that's going to last a lifetime\nOkay well let's go with a like a pioneer woman what did you do for her [laughter]\nOh my goodness well and so I actually met the pioneer woman through her best friend and if you read our blood to know her name is Cindy McCain and and we actually connected because she was looking on\nA I guess she was just looking at stuff on ... and she found my link and she was looking at my website and thought you know I'd like to work with this girl that what are the chances that she's anywhere close to us\nAh but I happened to be because at that point I Lived in Tulsa so it's just like forty five minutes from Pasca and where they live and so we got together and I read that her ...\nAnd and luckily really liked it and she put it on our blog and after that and hired me to do her set for her show on the network\nAnd and that went over well so then as a lot of people know she opened the store and ... the ... and and\nIt said destinations thought for sure so if you're anywhere in the area or if you have some time you should definitely go down and check it out but it's then it's got a whole restaurant and then there's a great gift area there's like um\nAn ice cream shop upstairs and then she just opened a little boutique hotel down the street so there's lots of stuff to do there but I ... with the the ... and doing all the design for that\nOkay well that was probably a big job\nOh yeah I mean it took a couple of years [laughter] I mean from concept to completion right yeah\nSo uh how did you which I'm sure we had a uh in by the way if you don't know who the pioneer woman is you need to just turn on HDTV\n[laughter] the network yeah network yeah because yeah it is the food network again and watch it it's a\nShe's so charming and she has a great story as well so yeah I can definitely get to know her I'm\nI'm always surprised that people don't know her because I'm so familiar but she's a big name out

to position so Kara passively is here of care passionately design what is junk to position\nSo I have had this conversation with a few people over the years because they just they hear me say that word and they're like oh what what do you even saying right now I have no idea what you're talking about\nBasically ... position as when you take two opposing things and put them together\nAnd so when a we're talking about this and and design perspective we might take at ... am rustic vibe and mix it with a glamorous ... so those two things when you think of them that really do not go together at all like the complete opposite well that sounds a little more appealing\nThan what are\nThe dictionary has an example of junk to position they say if a white or served you a whole fish and a scoop of chocolate ice cream\n[laughter]\nRight or surprise might be caused by the juncture position\nSo I Do\nLike the rustic and the glamorous better example of that\nYeah I mean you know maybe the best chefs in the world gets somehow make that work um but that's a yeah as a designer that's what I'm trying to do I'm going to make that those opposing things come together and work work and well\nWent out and say you've got a a rancher that likes a very sleek modern designing a house in ... so that that's almost a juxtaposition right there right and\nYeah personnel like as a person you would think they'd want to go ... that they actually enjoy monitoring luck yeah\nAnd if that would probably still bring in a something for them to put their boots on that might be a little rustic hub for\nYeah yeah it's a balance you're bringing in things that so for example one in my first house and we did it hadn't for an out of corrugated metal\nAnd and but we had it in a curvy pattern and so had this you know Kirby shape to it which is very glamorous than and shiny and kind of sparkly so that's glamorous than its corrugated metal so once again that sounds\nJust these very visual things though at the radio it's a little hard to get those softened it yes read it's not just didn't have the sharp edges\nRight right so that I can see that on my portfolio but those are just that kind of the idea of how you bring to opposing things together\nI'm going to give your spelling of your name again because you you're probably on Instagram ... and you definitely have a ... page yes a and a Facebook page and its Kara K. A. R. A.\nPassionately and that is spelled P. A. S. L. A. Y. mhm designs yes man oh okay\nIs time for our money moment to our little money mortgage moment with dean ridell good morning dean\nDo more but I Can't hear you I'm doing great having a fun day how about you did a great show it to you so much it's interesting isn't it it is good stuff didn't know about ... position but yeah I'm Still trying to figure that out", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
