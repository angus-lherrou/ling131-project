real estate and we're interviewing today Dave ... who's a structural engineer and we're kind of busy rowing in\nAnd talking about crawl space houses and the problems with access the problems the need for ventilation and such [noise]\nIt is time for our word of the day rocky by Robbins roofing where their word every day is trust you can trust Robbins roofing to help you select the right material to go on your roof the right material to go under your shingles and ah\nProtect you from years of more sure intrusion into your house Robbins roofing is seven to eight thirty seven hundred seven to eight thirty seven hundred and our word today is ventilation\nAnd ventilation is providing fresh air basically\nA to a room of building a space just providing fresh air that fresh air\nHas molecules that attract other molecules right and it's getting rid of all that air yeah ventilation is good and sometimes folks talk about their house being tight\nAnd nowadays they literally create holes in your house for extra ventilation because the homes are built too tight\nPeople keep breathing air over and over again and apparently that's not good for you\nHave you seen those ventilation sent like ideal homes puts in it is a true vent from outside inside of the house because their houses they they test them\nAnd measure the amount of air loss and there's not enough exchange for healthy living without this vent being put in\nI haven't seen it but I wouldn't doubt it\nIsn't that it's just it's bizarre to me I'm going okay we'll use a little less weather stripping I don't know yet make the doors for worse yeah [laughter] there there is a good solution to these things right yes there is so but there is such thing as too tired of the house and maybe to budget ventilation if if the\nWind comes sweeping down the plane of your living room maybe that's too much yeah your draped shouldn't be blowing when the wind blows right there [laughter]\nOkay but the elections important and we talked about in the attic we've talked about in under the house and I crawl space [noise] tell me about\nA this is just out of left field but how about a a storm cellar\nWhile most storm sellers that I've been in have the early bird on the outside so they have a source of outside error or a world event about the ones inside the garage and the ground I'm not sure that those metal doors fit that airtight that slide back over them\nOkay I think you're right I think it's probably just a little gap there to where they can and yeah that was built in but you got to have fresh air or you suffocate to breathe and your house is kind of the same thing has to suffocate and get sick and\nYes it's parts are going to fall apart to just like our bodies do if we don't get fresh air exactly gotta have ventilation for a so let's talk about ah we talked about the things that do support under a house but what do we do when it fails\nHow do they do that I mean rather than just putting shims under a for joy St sometimes for Joyce rot\nThey they do and that's sort of goes back to the the the ventilation if you have a crawl space that is not\nWell vetted and you have poor drainage which means that it's probably very damp\nOr in your cross ... over a period of time would will ... will deteriorate what will last forever if you if you treat it right but if you don't treat it right and it's a very moist environment it will that will deteriorate and I\nHave been in ... basis Becky where I've actually grabbed one of the joys and I can pull it apart that's\nA rotten it's been I've been in houses were\nYou couldn't walk from one side of the room to the other without falling through the floor of floors and such\nPoor can poor conditions so there's a wide range of bad things that that can happen as far as the condition of across space\nHis concerns of the least is you're you're getting some ... some on even this then you can go into the crawl space and you can install concrete pads and and blocks and beans and you can gradually jak up and you can level and take some of the\nThe deflection out of the floor which if there's room if that's a fairly easy solution\nIf you go into the crawl space and there's a lot of moisture deterioration or even a term I damage\nIt's there have been times when it's been necessary to reframe the whole floor you know you pull up the flooring and you're exposed to the floor Joyce which are in terrible condition and you tear them out and you just\nYou just start over as far as reframing the floor so you know that's why it's important to\nTo not ever never walked in I don't know the grammar of that but you need them you need to look into your crawl space from time to time to make sure that everything is way\nThat it should be in the way yeah now who would you call to do look into across space or just on like say maybe I say you should walk around your house once a month", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
