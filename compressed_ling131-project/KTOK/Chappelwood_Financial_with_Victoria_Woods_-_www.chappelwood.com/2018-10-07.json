I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future um Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell ... us no good question you know I think that um you know ...\n... valid lean as mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to a win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you were with each\n... each you know a couple of generations you change a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken it too far\nA in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThere's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any of any faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids left just eighty year old kid likes to dress up and so it's there is something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and ask them for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or you could\nTwo hundred years from now there'll be who you know you got like do you get that [laughter] [noise] yeah that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about the seat panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening to

that we've taken him to Disneyland you know I've written the bike up in the mountains and blah blah blah you know what do I do [laughter] yeah and they really\nDid like some kind of a checklist that you have to get done as early as possible\nThere's loneliness can set it right you know if you do not stay in engaged in them and maybe you lose a spouse let's just say horrible situation but what happens is is that sometimes\nYou know you plan for retirement and your two years out or a year at and the spouse skin and then you have to take care of them and then they die and you haven't you know you're playing was with the spouse and now loneliness in so it it can be\nA very devastating to your health and we've had that happen to clients and that's it's heartbreaking me when we see that happen you got to remember too because there's nothing wrong with having the feelings that gosh my\nStatus the job I had the status the purpose in life all my relationships\nI remember when George night God love it I adore this man you talk about the end on both former governor former lieutenant governor former teacher former president you know what do you call George and he'll tell you just call me too [laughter] I Love this man\nBut when he was at the University of Oklahoma he central locally here and do you see oh in Edmond I remember his assistant calling and should send victorious ... he just doesn't get to see so upset\nPeople don't immediately returned his phone calls I don't you know we got to have somebody explained to him you're not governor anymore you're just president [laughter] and I said well done on that was his assistant the time not is why I said why exactly are you calling me I'm not doing this I'm not Dylan George George as\nI went I was in school or do you win a George was the president that he would come into the student union but he helped to build a new wife called benign University's Center for him and he would come and sit and have lunch with us it was a student at once with and saves the coolest thing\nHe is the coolest guy ever and if you had never met them and if you ever get the opportunity he is just the coolest guy but you know if you if you don't have a plan you may be just sitting around watching the grass grows um and and it that's what you want to do that makes you happy that's okay but if it doesn't make you happy then you're going\nTo help climbing out does make you happy you can only do that for so long because eventually you will get bored and and unfortunately their retirement boredom and loneliness can lead to an early death\nAnd the best thing you can do if you're even seven years out from your retirement if you haven't done this you know people talk about their you know their bucket list and and I get make a bucket list\nOr a checklist you know it can be short it can be long but what you want to do is you want to have a list of things that that are going to be important to you in your retirement that no one you're going to enjoy\nBut also things that will keep you active as far as physically active mentally active\nAnd you do need to put a plan together to have a very successful happy\nRetirement if

lifestyle and his name to a retirement community\nLatitude Margaritaville as Jimmy does its new chain of retirement communities and they cater to people fifty five and over\nSo I guess you know there's a lot more people retiring fifty five and if they go to Jim misplaced and I'm not going to die or\nRoughly death because it's going to be a fun place I'm sure with locations now in Daytona Beach Florida Hilton Head South Carolina and water South Florida homes range from two hundred to three hundred and fifty thousand a cooking with pretty recently for a ride on the beach extremely reasonable\nIt's location right on the beat makes it I really true paradise where else would you expect Jimmy Buffett to open up retirement communities I Would love to know who pitch this idea to him because it is amazing\nBecause their speech and if you go online and look at it they're featuring some beautiful backdrop you know on the ocean it's going to come with spacious homes some way even with pools which I Love to see if you don't want the ocean side and now I'm going to have your own private fool\nIt feels more like a spot that our retirement community it it truly is sounds extremely exciting and it's very ambitious considering you're looking at\nHe's already got three location it's not like let's start with this and then we'll tweak it and make it better no it's it's already he's already got three of them set up so for more information visit WWW latitude Margaritaville dot com we've been talking about the dark side of retirement now Jimmy Buffett is not that at all\nBut there are some dark sides and we all know that retirement is supposed to be one of the most fun failed greatest chapters of your entire life\nAnd if you plan properly it can be just let\nSo let's talk about getting here let's talk about your plans so you can go live in Margaritaville that just should be the day with latitude things yeah I got to talk to them about that really bothered me there's also a

energy in the ad council [noise]\nAbout the money honey on your house they called me to financial data because Mr Damon king they call him the king of finance says the AT T and wealth management specialist at chapel with financial services\nSo happy to have you here today but we are talking about dark side the dark side of retirement the dark side of living in today's environment and our last segment I mean we were talking about the hackers and people stealing your identity and the millions and millions of people that have already been stolen\nWe just talked about Equifax breach last year let's think about this a hundred and forty five million credit profile you know what's in a credit profile everything every account number ...\n... mortgage car loans\nYes and in order to pay them off if you're a senior citizen and you have no doubt whatsoever if you are a\nPre retiree and you have no doubt whatever the problem is is that people go out and actually not only their hacking your\nTax return money and taking it right out of your mailbox they are actually going out and they're getting mortgages on your home now there don't let your home you live in your home they're just taking your money let's say you have a three hundred and fifty thousand dollar home that you're taking that three hundred and fifty thousand dollars out\nThere are people that look for those who have recently died yeah you'll those identities and then take their Social Security checks they pretend like this person's life mhm I mean it's amazing\nIt's amazing what goes on out there and you know it takes a really smart creative people to do this you know this is why have such a hard time every year with the continuing education course anti money laundering because I don't know why somebody would spend so much of their energy and time washing money when you could just do something and use\nThat and I generally among those people took the brain power and the genius and you know to try to do cancer research I mean we have to answer cured and fifty years you have all these brains would get together for good but\nExactly it's just amazing I I don't know why they if they think it's amusing they think it's a challenge or whatever it is well hackers we know do they think it's a challenge it's a competition who can hack among a camera\nBut maybe wearing your emails us as well or phone calls claiming to be from the IRS now we all know about these stories people calling in claiming they the IRS is going to legally you know come in and\nTake your home if you don't send them money right now\nWell first of all they're never going to do this and second of all do not\nAmber open up an email if it has the word\nStanding in front of it are spam in front of it or detection in front of it or if it is to you from you [laughter] now this is how this is the newest technique\nYou get an email from yourself to you if you did not see yourself and email do not\nIt because in in sometimes if you just open it but they're gonna threat and they just happened to me recently and it happened again literally this morning before I did this show I saw another one\nOr another investment advisor said Victoria I've gotten one to calm down you know this is you know it happens but if they're really fishing if you open the link that they send you when they scare you to death to say your identity has been\nAnd you know this because I just got into your email and here it is\nAnd here's your password well I can tell you typically you change your passwords anyway you shut and if you don't if that is your password if you can see it without opening and that\nPassword was there it was a true password on mine but it was probably six seven years ago\nSo they were able to get in and see that old password hackers are good mhm just be very careful in much of it if you don't know the person sending it to you or if it's to you from you that's the that's the first year again that's a big report that's a big red flag\nBut typically these messages you know they threaten me with some kind of a legal thing or exposing you telling you knew that like with the money was telling that I've seen which you looked at on line and blah blah blah scaring you and you're going out and look at that trash on like what are you talking about but it scares you end up and it says since seven hundred and fifty dollars to bitcoin\nImmediately if you don't know what bitcoin is click this link will you click this link and either it freezes your computer or your opening the door for your opening the door you are doing it for them\nSo don't do it just be smart and I know it sounds scary but here's the things the Irish will never contact you you know when you hear that phone call that says we're from the IRS and we want your Social Security and you better send us money right away or we're going to send somebody to your door and they're going to put you in jail it's ridiculous\nBecause in fact the IRS itself has provided a list of five wasted tell if the person contacting you is a scam artist\nNumber one on that list the IRS will never call to demand immediate payment nor will they call to discuss a packs past tax situation without first\nHaving mailed you a report we have a client her name is Kay Kay was smart enough she gets one of these letters she calls me what you always say diamond call us for everything you always say everything that has anything to do with your financial life will you know what\nYou know what I say everything is in your mind is a lot this tax letter said that she had all this money which there was a tax that she she had when her husband passed away and lo and ... and it was substantial I'm Talking for a retired person this is very substantial\nAnd she brought it to me and of course we looked into it because she did get the letter but we went further than that\n'cause you can you can copy an Irish doesn't even have a good let her head it just says IRA not even anything in Boston just on a plane piece of paper\nSo when you see things like this check into them pick up the phone and call we know of an instance with a a banking relationship we have right now that a client called to tell his private banker that he had a situation he had a a a fine out in some county and this was in Texas\nAnd some county in Texas and she goes that sound right to me well I got this phone call he says oh this I Want to take out this amount of money and can you just send it over there to them and here's where you send it she said I'll be happy to do it but let's just call him Joe Joe with you don't\nThink well known business owner if you don't mind I happen to know the sheriff in county blah blah blah and to make a quick call for you sure enough she calls and he says we don't do that\nThat is not how we operate that it's a scam and this is again\nA substantial amount of money I Believe it was like ten thousand dollars\nI mean this wasn't you know ... and it was believable to him this is a business or he'd he just wanted to take care of it he said this is an obligation either\nForgot something there's a link there was some issue but she said just let me make a call get with your advisor people again a very smart man because once he gave that money away you know forget it it's done\nIt would take you probably fifty thousand to try to get in\nFront of him or you know to me it's on like defensive driving you know just as when you're out driving defensive driving just assume everyone's drunken ... so you're very safe so when it comes to this kind of stuff just assume that someone's out to get you All right\nYou can always verify later if it's true or not but don't ... their banking on you being scared and when you're scared when did you tend to make really poor decision they call a natural decisions\nBernie can you know they call it your motivation to\nDo other things you know don't share your online user account your password your profiles with anybody you know and like I said don't store your credit cards are on online retailers a convenient sure but it's also dangerous\nYes when they say would you like to store this for later yes you just have a tendency oh please make it easy for me it's a easy button but don't\nDo you get a friend request from someone on Facebook and you're already friends with them on ... that should be suspicious 'cause you don't go clicking on a nice chances are they're account got ... ... that happened to me\nOf course and the mayor of Guthrie right now I got a friend request I had been friends with him for over twenty five years\nAnd I get a friend request from him I simply picked up my phone 'cause I got it it was way early in the morning like before anybody got up I Want to say it was like one forty seven in the morning and when I got up and I got that morning early I was working five thirty or something\nI saw that popped up I said I picked up my phone text him and said you've been hacked I got a friend request and that's all you didn't even respond he knew immediately when I went back I think it said [noise] 'cause I didn't know if he knew this change your password immediately that's what you have to do\nYou just have to do it and sometimes you have to end up doing it three or four times I I had to change my password multiple times until finally are picked something so difficult", "station": "KTOK", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
