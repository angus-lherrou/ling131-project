success\nIsn't born or is it aren't how much of your financial success and that please think about this that of your children depends on trade she were either born with or lessons that you're teaching your children that you have learned in that church teaching your children now mhm\nWell we just talked about major versus nurture right when it comes to financial success and while\nMajor does play a large role we're about to make a very strong case for nurture there's more coal rich habits they looked success but it's a wealthy right\nOr wealthy individuals written by a guy named Thomas ... I Love this book and I refer ... quite a lot when I teach my classroom ... Thirty years ago when he did a five year study of habits but wealthy people sharing the identified three hundred going\nOn but I Know you've brought this up several towel your town and I think it's amazing how ever shared all three hundred and ...\nSo what's your view of our favorites and and the good news is ladies and gentleman none of these habits have nothing\nNone of these habits of anything to do with how much you know about money or how much money you have their lifestyle choices so anybody can do these number one you gotta set and keep your goals inside write them down make sure that they're achievable and specific\nA high percentage of millionaires and wealthy families do this they take some little action everyday to achieve their goals\nAnd so a big users writing them down I tell my wife all the time well I mean you inspired me to make my visualization board it's written down I see it every day so I have no one to blame but myself if I don't get back\nLike well and you can get one step further dime and then that is not only do you write them down a most people don't they always point to their head and neck on oh I've got goals are right here I'm Sorry I just looked at him and go oh I don't get it they just don't get it\nBecause first of all nobody knows about um if they're just in your head and second of all there's something very powerful about writing them down\nSecond and third late it's very powerful to put it in front of you like you just said and see them every day but more importantly is that you look at those goals every single morning and you say to yourself because this is what should be on your list is the\nFirst day in the morning when you wake up it is thank God for all the benefits and all the blessings I have had and then you say what can I Do today to get one step further to my goal\nBecause most people that set those goals in January never achieved them what you do is you write those go down and you share them with the world\nSaying them out loud as important putting that out in the universe you will attract people that will help you achieve your goals but if you write them down and then share them with everyone I can assure you\nMy testimony is\nI I Am bullet proof you cannot convince me that writing them down does not create the momentum and the success and you've got to have a plan ... God blesses those people with a plan you must have a vision people without a vision will perish\nI don't intend on perishing I buy my intention I live with the intention of rolling our business and growing our business to us means what helping more mean you're drenched morals changing last one day at the time\nI'm One of my number two\nNumber two I thought you were going to let me go on 'cause I on my little tangent there but number two is and know what needs to be done keep it to do list", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
