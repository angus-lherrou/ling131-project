about the money honey the number one most listen to financial show here on the weekends come until you live from the studios sweets\nA Rockefeller Plaza no I'm just kidding uh here in Edmond, Oklahoma always happy to be here on the radio with you each weekend on newsworthy one thousand ... thanks so much for joining us well listen up if you're a first responder that's our police officers are firefighters are EMTs\nYou actually have a special opportunity if you are an AT and T. customer with your mobile service your cell phone that sort of thing you can join a special service called first and that\nPerson that is a subscription service that you talk onto your a TNT plan and if you were first responder it gives you priority\nFor bandwidth for being able to make calls in case of an emergency and so uh you know for example you're out somewhere you're oh you're at a basketball game and there's an emergency wrote a thunder game there's an emergency and there are Eighteen thousand people their cell phone service is tough to get struggling\nTo oh you're oh yeah yeah that's the argument on your game I might as well forget it I Can't make any\nCalls until I get out of Mormon so ah but what this allows you to do is you get a two hundred dollar credit and a forty percent off select smartphone accessories when you activate a new smartphone in line with an eligible first met mobile plan again you have to do this through a TNT but it's a really great deal Victoria\nI get like twenty percent oh yeah and one isn't it a a two hundred dollar credit ... percent off and there are a lot of really cool features\nWith this and it's three TNT because you get first priority which means first responders connect first you don't have to compete with non emergency users for connection when there's an emergency preemption and make sure that first responders have the bandwidth they need by detour and others off the network so basically you just freeze up space you know\nFor example when we have the California wildfires you know or trying to make calls all left and right to their loans\nAnd there were some issues you know with some of the cell phone networks and making sure that firefighters got through and talk to command so um anyway a great deal it's called first met and again you can get a two hundred dollar credit and forty percent off when you have a person that mobile plan and this is good again whether you are a paid\nFirst responder or even for volunteers so pretty cool deal\nWhen he called el ...\nThat's right well you're just joining us we are taking a look back at the financial crisis of two thousand they it is hard to believe that tore that it's been a full decade I Believe and I agree one of the darkest days in the history of the u._s. stock market

management specialist and it's hard to believe it's been ten years a decade since the financial crisis and many of you have done quite well since then and I would expect you have done well we have been in the longest economic expansion in our nation's history since the financial crisis\nBut you're also looking for a little bit of normalcy in your life you want to restore order back to your life you want your lifestyle you want peace in your life and that's what we provide here a chapel would financial services because we know that uh your life changes retirement changes in retirement sometimes can be messy well we were like a big cleanup crews time so\nFit in with somebody coming in next week that talks about well look I'm just hot mess yeah I've got to count all over the place I Know it's time yeah you know it's it's time my my wife said I've got to get this done before the end of the year 'cause it's just I'm a hot\nMatter occasionally occasionally Victoria has to do a little bit of marriage counseling through that's that's kind of what we do sometimes but\nIt takes what ever my climate ...\nYeah regardless of what you're looking for and we know you're just trying to restore order and you're just looking for a safe harbor to go to and someone to walk you through all of this\nMany of our clients have saved a million dollars or more for retirement and that's why a lot of what we talk about on the show caters to them specifically but we also know many of us said half a million dollars and you're trying to get into that millionaires club and you know you're going to get there eventually you're just looking for a guide to help you walk through that minefield\nSo give us a call here if you have saved at least half a million dollars for retirement\nFor all five three for eight or nine o nine is the number to call I've got five appointments every week set aside Victoria's schedule is a little more limited she's taking a three more clients this year of at least three million dollars in assets\nAnd so um you know if you want a piece of the tour to the financial leave his mind uh give us a call for all five three for eight or nine o nine shall we might will get you scheduled for an appointment but it begins with a short thirty minute second look phone call so that we can find out more about you and make sure you qualify so there you go\nWell a Victorian so we've talked about um how the financial crisis began ... without being yeah the the housing market or the the bubble burst\nAnd um how did you you know how you reacted at that time how clients revealing than we talked about how the bottom finally came in March of two thousand nine even though no one knew at the time but that was the bottom\nPanic was still heavy on everybody's mind but as we've all collapses as with all the financial crises there is a recovery and as far as most people are concerned July twenty fourth of two thousand nine is widely considered when the financial crisis was over\nBut the scars still remained so after that time did you see major changes in the way that your clients are approached allocating their money\nWell yes but before we discuss that Damon you cannot discuss the financial crisis without talking about to other things and that is number one December can't as another very important day and that is when ... and Bernie Madoff came out and said\nYes I'm a fraud yes I have stolen sixty five billion dollars million ruined lives there was one gentleman a Terry\nVillage shoot believe is French he was managing one point four billion I Believe committed suicide\nOver this because he this was his friend he restaurants one point four billion\nOf other people's money I mean I I don't know if I could\nI could have survived it if it knowing that\nThere were people in this town and advisors that I Know which are no longer friends associates of mine at all because they literally put their kids on their desk and walked out of their offices so I this is my thinking so\nYou're just going to be in the business and help people when anybody can throw in dark and make more money than you just it was ridiculous but when it gets tough you're going to walk away\nDon't even talk to your class but your keys on your desk and walk out the door and diamond this happened again and again and again and but they were just stockbroker so that was a difference and financial planning and for our clients because we were so diversified it was good\nBut the other problem to sites made off that was December tent\nThen there's dates after that it's very significant and when he was arrested I was in New York right after that I ... I had been here and I just done an interview I was with Jen more financial up in New York I was doing a TV interview with Fox News\nAnd lo and behold I'm coming down the street\nI don't even know where we are because I'm taking my God daughter shopping she's flown in from Canada and ... Smith and just in a wonderful story on from Fox News on him that morning and I was listening to that is a bright young lane I'm In the bathroom\nGetting ready and I walk out and look at her beautiful blue eyes and I said that is one shark young lady I come walking down the street and lo and behold all of these advanced start pulling that\nSo we're going back to our hotel we're going back now and they're they are well NBC comes up and wants to interview me and I said that they think you meant let let me I'm I Walk across the street to made off department because that's just started to stream or on a lookout I go I don't believe that we're standing here\nAnd if it had not been for all those bans I look at their house apartment the lights are on and I walk across the street every single corner the streets were lined up with fans and there was Sondra Smith and she was doing an interview and she told me\nI said well just in an interview this morning with you guys but I did an interview with NBC yesterday before leaving town about I made off and that that's when the judge has said do not do anything do not give anything away everything is frozen well his wife sent some jewelry to a family member well they're going to throw him in jail now\nAnd the driver is sitting there and ... we're not going to we're not going anywhere tonight I said well how do you\nLook in all these bans I said the judge just said it was on the news she\nSaid oh no the drivers know everything the\nDriver just said hey I'm just sitting out here for ... we're not going anywhere and they didn't but what she told me which no one knew at the time which I didn't know is that she said what scares me and she goes I better be repaid\nFor what I'm doing and risking my life she said you see that building behind us the Russians could be there right now they're waiting to kill him I said what and that's the first time I heard that ... they he took money from the Russian yeah well\nAnd if you haven't seen the made off mini series on NBC it's a really fascinating\nAnd interestingly enough I think Victoria there's a scene in the show where he is arrested okay he comes out of his apartment\nAnd there's a big in front of his apartment they're pushing him and you were the that's the that's yesterday you were there were as close to that show folks if you go and watch the made off I Can't remember the name of the actor I'm oh he was in jaws um gosh what his name is well known actor\nBut anyway um go watch that it's a report many serious just fascinating about his rise and fall are so go check that out so\nThat's the thing you know you ... you end up you know like we just you know you don't end up hating him but then when you start remember wait a minute\nLikeable how well and of course you begin to hate them when they start flashing the names and showing people the ... yeah the lives he destroyed that\nI got him to his they they kinda likeable and but it does show I think how easy it was where I Am to take people's money and you're talking Steven Spielberg you're talking Kevin Bacon or ... high profile people high profile people that don't want you to know but guess what it all came out public how many of his", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
