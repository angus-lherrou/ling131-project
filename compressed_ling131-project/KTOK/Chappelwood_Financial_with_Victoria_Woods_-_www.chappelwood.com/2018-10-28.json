I I think what was I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence ended the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're originally let out a gym then it's kind of you if you can test instead yet\nReally sorry about that then you let go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying but for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nIs that right I Am ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their release all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's Cristobal such a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of the rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... a month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh massively I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene in the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or to call a tourist and still happens the biggest one is October which will never go I\nWell I really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state there they can make their entire year in the week that the state fair is open so I I I Would never guess shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but it but other than what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say I'm over the course of a year\nBut now we're certainly open longer so did you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round to stay on roads and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially like to be around that time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance the er the barrel grouchy the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town then Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\n'cause they're just getting over Iran and people were like using the grave as picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not in front of a bar inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over ...\nStart heading to the train and start adding to your cars so there that's really\nGood at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you to take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the ...\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad really bad they\nWere they going to get them up before the ... or maybe the to the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author or thank you so much a season with the which\nThe magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts who is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list of things that are have a\nGreat night the fact checking off one when I go to Ross well in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween sorry on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn coast to coast day I'm All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget the men from the train next on coast to coast am this is\nAn somebody you don't want to have to worry about these buildings come with the shooting Keene\nThat's a decision you shouldn't happen [noise]\nIt's a huge burden question financially and so it allows you to give a singular focus to your child\nKnown hospital that takes care of their patients has thoroughly [noise]\nThat was the first thing I like how are we going to do that when they told us that we didn't have to pay [noise]\nSingle now I'm like wow\nThey pretty much stay die\nIt's like the world has been lifted off your shoulders and now your focus is supporting this child [noise]\nThere is not an afterlife\nThat patient care is magical\nIt saved my life [noise]\nAnd while you love them and you love your grandkids you cannot sacrifice your own retirement for them you didn't work all those years so that you can make a kid's rich\nSo you've got to think about that and so if that means creating some type of a legacy for them or whether you do that with an investment portfolio perhaps you do that with some kind of protection strategy like an indexed annuity whatever that looks like for you\nSet aside some amount of money so that your kids will have a legacy and then spend the rest because you certainly don't want to be in a situation where you are sacrificing your dream retirement to support your kids\nAnd then finally we got renovations and remodeling and old home things like roofs failing air conditioner system to go out driveways get cracked windows need to be replaced your plumbing goes out your foundation begins to say all of these things happen when you own a home that's why a lot of clients\nAs they get older they decided to downsize I don't want to deal with all those expenses anymore but if you still have a home\nEven if it's paid off\nIf you plan to stay in your home\nWell then you need to make sure that you set aside some money for repairs because at some point that house was going to have to be sold year either you're gonna do it or your kids are going to do it when you are gone and you know someone's going to have to fix up that house to make sure that itself\nOwning stuff costs money and whether that's owning your own health or owning your home it costs money that's just the way it is and that's why we create income plans here chapel with financial so that our clients understand All right I Need X amount of dollars to show up in ...\nBank account every month if it's going to cost this well this is how much I Need and inflation adjusted tax adjusted\nAnd we know that you're listening right now because you know retiring well as an easier probably worrying about it thinking about it but you're not quite sure where to turn to or or who to turn to what to do\nAnd you know let's just be honest getting guidance on taxes and Social Security and long term care and income and leaving a legacy how not to run out of money\nThese are things that any decent good financial advisor should be able to provide the leader just the prerequisites of being a financial advisor\nYou expect to get this from any financial advisor that you work with\nSo trying to distinguish between financial advisors based on those things it's very difficult to do what you really want is someone who's going to help you transition from a working life to retire life because of retirement changes everything it can be messy it's a lifestyle shift a massive proportions you've never done it before\nAnd it can make you feel out of control so when it comes to a financial advisor in addition to managing all the assets you really just looking for somebody to help you re establish control in your life to help you help put you back at the center of things give you control\nAnd restore normalcy to your life you're looking for a safe harbor someone that's going to help

I'm a certified financial planner professional and wealth management specialist with chapel with financial\nThe mega millions jackpot was drawn this week it was one Powerball rolled over\nBut the mega millions jackpot was one it was the largest lottery pride in world history\nAnd apparently from what we know right now just one ticket was the winter uh in South Carolina was a tiny little town called Simpson bill South Carolina the grand prize one point six billion dollars\nIs likely going to be taken in a lump sum and what a lot of people don't realize is that the jackpot that they they talk about that the money you would receive if you took it as an annuity meaning lifetime payments\nFor a period of years or guaranteed payments for a period of years I think it's like twenty nine years or something but if you take the lump sum while that's going to be reduced somewhat and so that lump sum is going to be eight hundred sixty eight million dollars now that's before taxes so I'm not really sure\nUh you know after they pay the taxes I'm not really sure how they're going to survive on just five hundred four hundred five hundred million dollars that's going to be tough to do the reason we're telling all this is because coming up next week you're going to want to be sure that you tune into a very special show\nWe're going to talk about what you should do immediately upon learning you're about to come into a very large sum of money whether that's winning the lottery maybe it's dragging big in the casino maybe you expect a really large inheritance\nOr maybe you're even going to

it could cost you thousands and thousands of dollars over\nThe life of your retirement it could even forced to go back to work which is the number one thing that we're trying to avoid unless you want to go back to work but you don't want to be forced\nTo work the things that wind up costing so many people so much money in retirement are the things that come out of nowhere I mean anybody can sit down and make a budget and say I'm going to spend money on this and this and that\nIt's the things you don't expect that can sink your plan so\nLike on the politics of flashing speeches and rustling

economy our state economy and nationally did you know that most businesses Ninety percent of businesses in the United states are small businesses\nSo small business is the economic engine that makes our country run well if you're just joining us today today's show is all about maybe maybe I'll retire and everything's going to go exec Lee according to plan or maybe I'll retire and your husband your wife or your parents' health is suddenly going to take a turn for the worst\nOr maybe you underestimated the amount of taxes you're going to owe on your IRA four one K. other retirement accounts when you start taking money\nOr maybe there was an unexpected major stock market correction for seen a lot of that volatility lately haven't we the Boeing is we've seen this movie a thousand times over it happens over and over a year after year\nBut the interesting thing is that more often than not there are ways simple ways usually to avoid these financial consequences coming up in this segment we're going to reveal to things that can ruin your retirement plan\nEven the most thoughtful forecasters cannot see the future no one can predict the future\nMuch less your personal financial events lives unpredictable it's messy jacket and their retirement nest egg can take some nasty twists and turns that leave a long lasting damage\nSo what's necessary that we address the effects as we progress through life and we change we change our forecasts sometimes we even have to change your strategies to recognize that your life changes things happen\nWe're in a different place than where we thought we were going to be and what was planned for five years ago is not what we need to plan for do they sometimes life changes within months\nThat's the reason why it's beginning of every one of our clients strategy reviews we ask has anything changed that we need to know about\nTwo major things that cause us to change our plans for our clients are events in financial markets so let's consider each one of these\nEvents we're talking about personal events as this kind of what I was just talking about these are unplanned events that destroy the meaning of your previous plan they basically take the plan that you know it was very sound the income land that we've created for you over the next Thirty years that was going to be really really great\nAnd now he's basically just a giant square ... toilet paper you know you might as well use it to line the bottom of your bird cage or you're a cat litter box because that's what it's worth now it needs to change\nThese are a major cataclysmic changes in your life or talking about divorce maybe get remarried\nMaybe there's a birth maybe there's a death all of these things are dramatic changes I think all the time about our client Phil Phil and his wife\nSandy came to see us they'd been longtime clients that came to see is a few years ago Sandia just retired she was a teacher bill was looking at retiring he was a doctor\nAnd we sat down Victorian I was sitting down at our conference room table you're a chapel would and they were excited about retirement we are planning dreaming we were talking about all the things we're going to do travelling spending time with the grandkids we had a review with them and we talked about the plan\nI'm Talking not not more than a couple of months later we get a call from\nPhil and\nSand he's been diagnosed with cancer and its pancreatic cancer and that is not a good prognosis and so um she put up a great fight but six months later Sandia passed away\nThey didn't plan that that was not an original plan they were younger than he was young early sixties and\nSo now our plan has changed completely doesn't it we have to now shift from the joy of planning the retirement for a loving couple to the pain of planning\nA funeral or where what are we going to do with these assets and to top make matters worse filled daughter ended up having cancer later on young woman\nVery young woman you know thirties breast cancer so life changes things happen and we have to plan for these things we have to be nimble\nFun but that's what we do is advisors\nYou got other things like job losses I think of our clients I've and I think of Kathy\nBoth worked in the energy industry and both lost their jobs when the energy industry took a a downturn here over the last few years energy has rebounded but they still lost their jobs so what do we have to do well now we have to shift\nFrom more of an accumulation portfolio to one of income specifically for Kathy what we had to do was\nShift her from a assets that were more crime for growth certain stocks things like that and we shifted it to more of an income based portfolio to increase her yield\nAnd so we looked at in multi asset income strategies we looked at strategies that generated a lot\nAnd David in income some bond and can we increased her ... her ... income present from about one and a half percent two three and a half percent we had to do that because now what she needs his income\nAccumulation is not as important income is more important so these are things that personal events that happened career changes a disability caring for a parent or child I think of Danny and Christie our clients Christie cared for her mother\nFor three years in a nursing home her mother passed away now Danny he's in the same boat with his parents his dad got an aging father that he's trying to care for he's working\nAnd he's trying to plan for his own retirement now he's trying to help his dad and they've got a piece of land that they've got us all of these things they they kind of add up they sneak up on you uninsured medical expenses Medicare doesn't uncovered dental vision or custodial care talking about long term care so these are personal events that can really record retirement\nThen we've got the financial markets that crazy thing that occasionally\nLikes to throw temper tantrum and really doesn't care what your plans are all that cares about is itself", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
