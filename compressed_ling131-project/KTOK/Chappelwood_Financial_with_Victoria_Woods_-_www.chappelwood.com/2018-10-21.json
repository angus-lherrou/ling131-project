{"year": "2018", "content": "Was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister ... eyes when his car accident and his healing processes aided by painkillers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this\nHe was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my oh James Pike up yes it was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before\nNow what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret to do this and that\nKind of breaking up with an honest Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK I'm area\nIt's actually a voiceover I. P. line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this they out and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case as fun as it is and as exciting it is it is not going to be the first break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do you know and\nSo all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back\nWith my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through or are there for it has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the\nOther letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and\nSo I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to his prove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now here in my desire to do this mistake out all over the last eight because of my mistake and lay off again a hole and to live with the knowledge that vice is continuing\nThat is my message to the world through my wife and through this psychic medium and those are the were\nFantastic Thomas out of people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot com is the both the paperback and e book and I do want to point out one interesting thing I'm Dr Gary ... wrote the book the afterlife experiments and he was a guest with art do all those years ago and I recently heard that Gary sports\nHas Harry Houdini a spirit that he's been working with over there at the University of Arizona about\nFashion that's fantastic well we'll have to get to Dr Schwartz on the program again and follow up\nOn ... yeah thank you so much for this\nWell Richard you're an excellent how you have a good heart and the work you do with making the world a better place and I appreciate it\nOr a God blessed and thank you Thomas resentful when we come back\nWho murdered FDR you heard me correctly who murdered\nFDR ... digging into the break suit

American caravan presses on I'm Pam who sales Fox News desperate measures at Mexico's border with Guatemala we're about two thousand migrants despite police orders yesterday to turn back\nSo you know that mental health I was kind of interesting I think so\nI'm going to fall into that category ... who's the boss of you or not [laughter] you're from the forties and I you know I never thought I did but it's like oh I just can't be bothered with that\nUh probably because they know that they had you know to work a little harder to get noticed in the middle child ... youngest yeah well the youngest and everybody takes care of them\nMy baby brothers that eight they said in kindergarten I don't know how he finds you know goes to the bathroom by himself and finds his way home because every little classmate had to help poor Kelly\nBecause we all did when you have seven brothers and sisters and you're this beautiful little blue eyed boy you just you siblings take care of the navy so it you know it just it you think about it in your own family it kind of makes sense [noise] mhm\nWell as you as you said you know when you're middle born or younger or you have to work a little harder to get noticed and so that probably leads you to take more risks they're down to being a risk takers ... an entrepreneur I mean they're just kind of goes hand in hand soaps\nDoesn't surprise me that later born children are a self employed so you're listening right now because you\nMaybe want to take risks maybe you don't want to risk is for sure retiring well isn't easy retiring is a risk\nBut you're not quite sure where to turn of what to do and let's be honest getting guidance on taxes\nAnd Social Security long term care and leaving legacy not running out of money these are important\nBut when

you to put all these things together in one basket\nOne plan will just like the ... listen to a radio show that came in this last week\nAnd you know and it doesn't matter how much money you had it is

financial success\nIsn't born or is it aren't how much of your financial success and that please think about this that of your children depends on trade she were either born with or lessons that you're teaching your children that you have learned and that you're teaching your children now ...\nWhere we just talked about major versus nurture right when it comes to financial success and while\nNature does play a large role we're about to make a very strong case for nurture there was a book called rich habits they looked success but it's a wealthy right or wealthy individuals and written by a guy named Thomas ... I Love this book and I'm reference it quite a lot when I teach my classroom ... Thirty years of unemployment\nHe did a five year study of habits but wealthy people share and he identified\nThree hundred going on but I Know you've brought this up several tunnel your town and I think it's amazing how ever shared all three hundred and ... so what's your view of our favorites\nAnd and the good news is ladies and gentleman none of these habits have nothing none of these habits of anything to do with how much you know about money or how much money you have their lifestyle choices so anybody can do these number one you gotta set and keep your goals inside write them down make sure that they're achievable and specific\nA high percentage of millionaires and wealthy families do this they take some little action everyday to achieve their goals\nAnd so a big key is just writing them down I tell my wife all the time well let me you inspired me to make my visualization board it's written down I see it every day so I have no one to blame but myself if I don't get\nBack like well and you can get one step further dime and then that is not only do you write them down or most people don't they always point to their head and neck on oh I've got goals are right here I'm Sorry I just look at him and go oh I don't get it they just don't get it\nBecause first of all nobody knows about um if they're just in your head and second of all there's something very powerful about writing them down\nSecond and third late it's very powerful to put it in front of you like you just said and see them every day but more importantly is that you look at those goals every single morning and you say to yourself because this is what should be on your list at\nFirst they in the morning when you wake up and is thank God for all the benefits and all the blessings I have had and then you say what can I Do today to get one step further to Michael\nBecause most people that set those goals in January never achieved them what you do is you write those go down and you share them with the world saying them out loud as important putting that out in the universe you will attract people that will help you achieve your goals\nBut if you write them down and then share them with everyone I can assure you\nMy testimony is\nI I Am bullet proof you cannot convince me that writing them down does not create the momentum and the success and you've got to have a plan ...\nGod blesses those people with a plan you must have a vision people without a vision will perish\nI don't intend on perishing I buy my intention I live with the intention of rolling our business and growing our business to us means what helping more mean yup ginger morals changing last one day at the time ...", "show_name": "Chappelwood Financial with Victoria Woods - www.chappelwood.com", "month": "10", "state": "OK", "day": "21", "station": "KTOK", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
