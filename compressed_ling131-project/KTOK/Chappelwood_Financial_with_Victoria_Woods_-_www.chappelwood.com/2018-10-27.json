monsters ooh\nAnyway thank you all for joining us that will be back here next Saturday thank you might get any\nMore until next week everybody got and enjoy the beautiful gardening day you're listening to one thousand Katie okay\nAnd while you love them and you love your grandkids you cannot sacrifice your own retirement for them you didn't work all those years so that you could make a kid's rich\nSo you've got to think about that and so if that means creating some type of a legacy for them or whether you do that with an investment portfolio perhaps you do that with some kind of protection strategy liking indexed annuity whatever that looks like for you\nSet aside some amount of money so that your kids will have a legacy and then spend the rest because you certainly don't want to be in a situation where you are sacrificing your dream retirement to support your kids\nAnd then finally we got renovations and remodeling and old home things like roofs failing air conditioner system to go out driveways get cracked windows need to be replaced your plumbing goes out your foundation begins to say all of these things happen when you own a home that's why a lot of clients\nAs they get older they decided to downsize I don't want to deal with all those expenses anymore but if you still have a home\nEven if it's paid off\nIf you plan to stay in your home\nWell then you need to make sure that you set aside some money for repairs because at some point that house was going to have to be sold year either you're gonna do it or your kids are going to do it when you are gone and you know someone's going to have to fix up that house to make sure that it sells owning stuff\nCosts money and whether that's owning your own health or owning your home\nCosts money that's just the way it is and that's why we create income plans here a chapel with financial so that our clients understand All right I Need X amount of dollars to show up in my bank account every month if it's going to cost this will be and this is how much I Need and inflation adjusted tax adjusted\nAnd we know that you're listening right now because you know retiring well as an easier probably worrying about it thinking about it but you're not quite sure where to turn to or who to turn to what to do\nAnd you know let's just be honest getting guidance on taxes and Social Security and long term care and income and leaving a legacy how not to run out of money\nThese are things that any decent good financial advisors should be able to provide you these are just the prerequisites of being a financial advisor\nYou expect to get this from any financial advisor that you work with\nSo trying to distinguish between financial advisors based on those things it's very difficult to do what you really want to someone who's going to help you transition from a working life to retire life because retirement changes everything it can be messy it's a lifestyle shift a massive proportions you've never done it before\nAnd it can make you feel out of control so when it comes to a financial advisor in addition to managing all the assets you really just looking for somebody to help you re establish control in your life\nTo help you help put you back at the center of thing give you control\nAnd restore normalcy to your life you're looking for a safe harbor someone that's going to help you maintain your desired quality of life and just live in peace that's what we provide a chapel with financial that's what makes us different it's not all the services and strategies we provide those

wonderful small businesses out there who make a real difference in our local economy our state economy and nationally did you know that most businesses Ninety percent of businesses in the United states\nAre small businesses so small business is the economic engine that makes our country run well you're just joining us today today's show is all about maybe maybe I'll retire and everything's going to go I exactly according to plan\nOr maybe I'll retire and your husband your wife or your parents' health is suddenly going to take a turn for the worst\nOr maybe you underestimated the amount of taxes are going to owe on your IRA four O. one K. other retirement accounts when you start taking money\nOr maybe there was an unexpected major stock market correction for seen a lot of that volatility lately haven't we the Boeing as we've seen this movie a thousand times over it happens over and over a year after year\nBut the interesting thing is that more often than not there are ways simple ways usually to avoid these financial consequences coming up in this segment we're going to reveal to things that can ruin your retirement plan\nEven the most thoughtful forecasters cannot see the future no one can predict the future\nMuch less your personal financial events lives unpredictable it's messy jacket and their retirement nest egg can take some nasty twists and turns that leave a long lasting damage so it's necessary that we address the effects as we progress through life and\nWe change we change our forecasts sometimes we even have to change your strategies to recognize that your life changes things happen we're in a different place than where we thought we were going to be and what was planned for five years ago is not what we need to plan for today sometimes life changes within months\nThat's the reason why it's beginning of every one of our clients strategy reviews we ask has anything changed that we need to know about\nTwo major things that cause us to change our plans for our clients are events in financial markets so let's consider each one of these\nEvents we're talking about personal events as this kind of what I was just talking about these are unplanned events that destroy the meaning of your previous plan they basically take the plan that you know it was very sound the income land that we'd created for you over the next Thirty years that was going to be really really great\nAnd now he's basically just a giant square ... toilet paper you know you might as well use it to line the bottom\nOf your bird cage or you're a cat litter box because that's what it's worth now it needs to change these are a major cataclysmic changes in your life or talking about divorce maybe get remarried maybe there's a birth\nMaybe there's a death\nAll of these things are dramatic changes I think all the time about our client Phil Phil and his wife Sandy\nCame to see us they've been a long time clients they came to see is a few years ago [noise] Sandia just retired she was a teacher bill was looking at retiring he was a doctor\nAnd we sat down Victorian are sitting down at our conference room table you're a chapel would and they were excited about retirement we are planning dreaming we were talking about all the things we're going to do travelling spending time with the grandkids we had a review with them and we talked about the plan\nI'm Talking not not more than a couple of months later\nWe get a call from Phil and sand he's been diagnosed with cancer\nAnd its pancreatic cancer and that is not a good prognosis and so um she put up a great fight but six months later Sandia passed away\nThey didn't plan that that was not an original plan they were younger than he was young early sixties and so now our plan has changed completely doesn't it we have\nTo now shift from the joy of planning their retirement for a loving couple to the pain of planning a funeral or where what are we going to do with these assets and to top make matters worse fills daughter ended up having cancer later on young woman\nVery young woman you know thirties breast cancer so life changes things happen and we have to plan for these things we have to be nimble they're not fun but that's what we do is advisors you got other things like job losses I think our clients I've and I think of Kathy\nBoth worked in the energy industry and both lost their jobs when the energy industry took a a downturn here over the last few years energy has rebounded but they still lost their jobs so what do we have to do well now we have to shift\nFrom more of an accumulation portfolio to one of income specifically for Kathy what we had to do was\nShift her from um assets\nThat were more crime for growth certain stocks things like that and we shifted it to more of an income based portfolio to increase her yield\nAnd so we looked at in multi asset income strategies we looked at strategies that generated a lot of dividend income some bonding can we increased her ... her ... income present Trump about one and a half percent two three and a half percent we had to do that because now what she needs his income\nAccumulation is not as important income is more important so these are things that personal events that happened career changes a disability caring for a parent or child I think of Danny and Christie our clients Christie cared for her mother\nFor three years in a nursing home her mother passed away now Danny he's in the same boat with his parents his dad got an aging father that he's trying to care for he's working\nAnd he's trying to plan for his own retirement now he's trying to help his dad and they've got a piece of land that they've got us all of these things they they kind of add up they sneak up on you uninsured medical expenses Medicare doesn't uncovered dental vision or custodial care talking about long term care so these are personal events that can really record retirement\nThen we've got the financial markets that crazy thing\nThat occasionally likes to throw temper tantrum and really doesn't care what your plans are all that cares about is itself\nMany well known experts in financial talking heads will give you the pronouncements on the future of inflation taxes\nAnd the market now we have to try to make projections we can't just stick our head in the Santa pretend like nothing's gonna happen but projections of what's best for you are for the most part based on the past not the future\nI think back to a one report that I saw from two thousand eight said that a portfolio one hundred percent in stocks was best for retiree and how we all know what happened to that model in two thousand eight don't wait\nI mean did you know that the market was going to struggle at the beginning of this year than I was going to have a great increase in July for September basically the third quarter and now here in October this month it's basically given everything back\nThe U.S and the five hundred was up over nine percent for the year in September now one month later it has a loss of about ... percent for the year that's how quickly things can change\nSo we don't know what the market's going to do we do our best to analyze it we do our best to prepare we look at the fundamentals of the market we know that\nCorporate earnings are strong or interest rates while they are going up are still relatively low inflation is still relatively low unemployment is relatively low corporate earnings are up these are all great signs of housing market seems to be in in good shape these are all great signs lots
