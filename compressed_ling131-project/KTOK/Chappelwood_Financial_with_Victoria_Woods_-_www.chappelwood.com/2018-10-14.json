already been teaching about this work\nYes yeah so um I was familiar with it but most out of body experience suggests to be clear or or spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react uh I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps you have that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as science has been part of that so\nMany people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over or their vibrating\nOr they're hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them\nIn our signals of there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to be travels the experience to ... the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have\nConsciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on\nThis class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are tall\nAnd he's interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to remind me\nOf my marriage is a device that um will it that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain waves which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\n[noise] but that that\nThat's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have\nThe literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional fell right and have the\nKind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about well the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have the ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's astral info astro in snow dot org and there are great resources on

to share but we have the ability to contact\nOr a loved one face to face\nYeah amazing experience that is incredible and and we don't need a medium to do it [noise] about every medium we'll give you a second hand information filtered through their own mind [noise]\nWell it's interesting 'cause you can also self at it but we will talk about that in a second and how you can do that or maybe even

just a little bit of care if I can I'm back\nYou know they were terrified it you know and they were reaching out to you know what what can we do um in our in our office though it used to what I Would do is I Would send out a quarterly report every quarter of the economic review\nI got to at that point starting that first week\nAnd we are in a different situation than other offices statement as you know we had people immediately our partners getting on with Goldman Sachs Lipman Gregory ... all these strategist all on the phone at once J. P. Morgan getting them on the phone so that we could have a conference call to say hey what's going on\n[noise] the biggest problem for me was now I knew the housing crisis was a problem I knew it was ... something was it was happening in that arena\nWe ... everybody's happy as long as we're making money everybody's\nFine but then leaning that's big and maybe not everybody knew ... but then when I get on the phone\nNever have to strategists on the phone at the same time you never you will never had and you have it in the last\nHere's been on a conference call they would never do that another big red flag to me\nThe third red flag was one of the strategy has said we're going to go and then they went around the table they literally rent around the table just like they would when they brought all the banks in and said you know you're in trouble Wells Fargo you're in trouble and everybody's going to take money because if we don't\nIf everybody doesn't take money if they didn't take the money from the government\nThen they would have a run on Wells Fargo and they'd have a run on banks where all of those banks that were in trouble financially\nOf us when you started seeing bailouts you know and and that all\nThat and they had and they kind of balance but they and they gave the money to them then they turn right around and the um it was the actual the banks J. P. Morgan lead this Jamie dime and he led the the fact that\nYou guys get your house in order because we're given this money back you got until the end of whatever it was it was in June and July you better get your your house in order I don't care what you have to sell but you're paying those ballots back because we're ... our money sitting over here in the in the corner waiting to get it back to the government\nYeah the government gave it to everybody because\nPeople would panic with bank of America and with Wells Fargo the banks that were\nLeveraged oh people are having to sell\nParts of their businesses they had to branch off that they had mortgage companies I had to sell those they had to sell golf courses you had to get back to business to do what you're supposed to be doing and that's called thank you\nSo when all that was going on our clients so you had you get on these calls and so when I was doing diamond is every single you know I went to once a week I was given an email that first week by\nThe second week I was doing one a day but the third week I'm telling you it was three a day\n... changing that fast and it was so fast and furious at inclines all they wanted to do was open that and you had to take all this massive amount of information and condense it down and put it in a paragraph so people can get up in the morning go what really happened I Can't trust what's on TV dressed me you couldn't\n... what's going on here and then you know I can go to work and the tour is going to tell me when I get home tonight what happened today when I needed and that's the way it was which\nI'm incidentally ladies and gentlemen as what we still do to this day you know we keep our clients updated than any time something is going on whether it's good or bad you know it's not enough to know what's going on which one do you why it's happening which is kind of well\nAnd I would tell them to the rest of the ... this is a headline today you heard this the rest of the story is and I would tell them now so they had confidence and knowing that we knew what was going on now\nWe're coming up the financial crisis may have been gone in two thousand eight but I've gotten worse in two thousand nine we're just getting started going down the rabbit hole oh there's made off that's right oh wait and wait to talk about and we're going to take a look back at the moment that we\nActually hit rock bottom in the two thousand a financial crisis we're taking a look ten years back it's two thousand a mental crisis you're listening to its own money I\nWalking back to it's all about the money honey the number one most listen to financial show here on the weekends coming to you live from the ... studio sweets\nRockefeller Plaza no I'm just kidding here in Edmond, Oklahoma always happy to be here on the radio with you each weekend on newsworthy one thousand kids who gave thanks so much for joining us well listen up if you're a first responder that's our police officers are firefighters are EMTs\nYou actually have a special opportunity if you are an AT and T. customer with your mobile service your cell phone that sort of thing you can join a special service called first and that\nPerson that is a subscription service that you talk onto your a TNT plan and if you were first responder it gives you priority\nFor bandwidth for being able to make calls in case of an emergency and so uh you know for example you're out somewhere you're oh you're at a basketball game and there's an emergency under game there's an emergency and there are Eighteen thousand people their cell phone service it's tough to get struggling\nTo oh you're oh yeah yeah that's what people are going to do your game I might as well forget it I Can't make any calls\nUntil I get out of Mormon so ah but what this allows you to do is you get a two hundred dollar credit and a forty percent off select smart phone accessories when you activate a new smartphone in line with an eligible for Schmidt mobile plan again you have to do this through a TNT but it's a really great deal Victoria\nI get like twenty percent oh yeah when is it is a a two hundred dollar credit ... percent off and there are a lot of really cool features\nWith this and it's three TNT because you get first priority which means first responders connect first you don't have to compete with non emergency users for connection when there was an emergency preemption and make sure that first responders have the bandwidth they need by deterring others off the network so basically you just freeze up space you know\nFor example when we have the California wildfires you know or trying to make calls all left and right to their loans\nAnd there were some issues you know with some of the cell phone networks and making sure that firefighters got through and talked to command so um anyway a great deal it's called first met and again you can get a two hundred dollar credit in forty percent off when you have a ... mobile plan and this is good again whether you are a paid\nFirst responder or even for volunteers so pretty cool deal\nWhen he called el ...\nThat's right well you're just joining us we are taking

looking for a little bit of normalcy in your life you want to restore order back to your life you want your lifestyle you want peace in your life and that's what we provide here a chapel would financial services because we know that uh your life changes retirement changes and retirement sometimes can be messy well we help clean up we're like a big cleanup crews time so\nIt is we have somebody coming in next week the talks about well look I'm just hot mess yeah I've got accounts all over the place I Know it's time yeah you know it's it's time my my wife said I've got to get this done before the end of the year 'cause it's just where I Am a hot\nMatter occasionally occasionally Victoria has to do a little bit of marriage counted too that's that's kind of what we do sometimes but\nIt takes what ever my ...\nYeah regardless of what you're looking for and we know you're just trying to restore order and you're just looking for a safe harbor to go to and someone to walk you through all of this\nMany of our clients have saved a million dollars or more for retirement and that's why a lot of what we talk about on the show caters to them specifically but we also know many of you have said half a million dollars and you're trying to get into that millionaires club and you know you're going to get there eventually you're just looking for a guide to help you walk through that minefield\nSo give us a call here if you have saved at least half a million dollars for retirement\nFor all five ... ... is the number to call I've got five appointments every week set aside

financial leave his mind uh give us a call for all five three or four eight or nine or ... will get you scheduled for an appointment but it begins with a short thirty minute second look phone call so that we can find out more about you and make sure you qualify so there you go\nWell a Victorian so we've talked about um how the financial crisis began we've talking yeah the the housing market or the the the bubble burst\nAnd um how did you you know how you reacted at that time how clients for feeling than we talked about how the bottom finally came in March of two thousand nine even though no one knew at the time but that was the bottom\nPanic was still heavy on everybody's mind but as we've all collapses as with all the financial crises there is a recovery and as far as most people are concerned July twenty fourth of two thousand nine is widely considered and when the financial crisis was over\nBut the scars still remained so after that time did you see major changes in the way that your clients are approached allocating their money\nWell yes but before we discuss that Damon you cannot discuss the financial crisis without talking about to other things and that is number one December tenth as another very important day and that is when they and Bernie Madoff came out and said\nYes I'm a fraud yes I have stolen sixty five billion dollars million ruined lives there was one gentleman a hairy\nVillage shoot believe is a French he was managing one point four billion I Believe committed suicide over this because he this was his friend he restaurants one port for ... billion of other people's money I mean I I don't know if I could\nI could have survived it is knowing that there were people in this town and advisors that I Know which\nAre no longer friends associates of mine at all because they literally put their kids on their desk and walked out of their offices so I this is my thinking so\nYou're just going to be in the business and help people when anybody can throw in dark and make more money than you just it was ridiculous but when it gets tough you're going to walk away\nDon't even talk to your class but your keys in your desk and walk out the door and diamond this happened again and again and again and but they were just stockbroker so that was the difference in financial planning and for our clients because we were so diversified it was good\nBut the other problem is I've made off that was December ...\nThen there's dates after that's very significant and when he was arrested I was in New York right after that I Am ... I had been here and I just done an interview I was with Jen more financial up in New York I was doing a TV interview with Fox News\nAnd lo and behold I'm coming down the street\nI don't even know where we are because I'm taking my God daughter shopping she's flown in from Canada and ... Smith and just done a wonderful story on from Fox News on him that morning and I was listening to that is a bright young lane I'm In the bathroom getting ready and I walk out and look at her beautiful blue eyes and I said that is one shark young lady\nI come walking down the street and lo and behold all of these advanced start pulling that\nSo we're going back to our ... hotel we're going back to ... and they're they are well NBC comes up and wants to interview me and I said I think you meant let let me I'm I Walk across the street to made off department because that's the start of the street we were on a look at it I go I don't believe that we're sending here\nAnd if it had not been for all those bans I look at their house apartment the lights are on and I walk across the street every single corner of the streets were lined up with bands and there was Sondra Smith and she was doing an interview and she told me\nI said well just in an interview this morning with you guys but I did an interview with NBC yesterday before leaving town about I made off and that that's when the judge has said do not do anything do not give anything away everything is frozen well his wife sent some jewelry to a family member well they're going to throw him in jail now\nAnd the driver is sitting there and ... we're not going to we're not going anywhere tonight I said well how do you\nLook in all these bans I said the judge just said it was on the news she said\nOh no the drivers know everything the driver just said hey I'm just sitting out here for ... we're not going anywhere\nThey didn't but what she told me which no one knew at the time which I didn't know is that she said what scares me and she goes I better be repaid\nFor what I'm doing and risking my life she said you see that building behind us the Russians could be there right now they're waiting to kill him I said what and that's the first time I heard that ... they he took money from the Russian\nYeah well and if you haven't seen the made off mini series on NBC it's a really fascinating\nAnd interestingly enough I think Victoria there's a scene in the show where he is arrested okay he comes out of his apartment\nAnd there's a big in front of his apartment they're pushing him and you were the that's the that's the other day you were there were as close to that show folks if you go and watch the made off I Can't remember the name of the actor I'm oh he was in draws um gosh of his name was well known actor\nBut anyway um go watch that it's a report many serious just fascinating about his rise and fall are so go check that out so\nAnd you know him that's the thing you know you end up you know like you know you don't end up hating him but then when you start re memory wait a minute\nWe'll be likeable how well and of course you begin to hate them when they start flashing the names and Sean ... lives he destroyed\nThat get him to his they make him kind of likeable and but it's to show I think how easy it was the end\nPeople's money and you're talking steaming don't learn your talking Kevin Bacon or ... people high profile people don't want you to know but guess what it all came out public how many of his\nBegins challenging huge embarrassment for a lot of people [noise] so you know how the how the financial crisis affect the type of advice you give were did you did you adopt any changes to your overall philosophy", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
