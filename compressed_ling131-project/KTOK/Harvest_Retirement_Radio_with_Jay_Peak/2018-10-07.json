brand new but you know three four years old\nIn a way with Linux you want it that way because the the as machines get older they're more likely to be supported you know it takes a little times of

Ninety six point one of\nThe [noise]\nThe deadliest transportation accident in the U.S in nearly a decade I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News twenty people killed in a crash involving a limo in upstate New York\nHall Eighteen people inside a two thousand one Ford Excursion limousine had died they were all reportedly on their way to a birthday party and the crash\nWe've also heard these alerts before the difference with this one is that you can opt out of other alert system this when you put an opt out so everybody was getting in the country has a long strange history with these types of alert system they've been trying to get them going on since the fifties so Miranda tell us a little bit about FEMA's role in this and some of these early system\nYou put it best when we were speaking off air FEMA has kind of been this mysterious doomsday ... wing of the government which I didn't know about until all this research we had to do for this segment and since the dawn of the Cold War they've been trying to figure out the best way to reach the most amount of citizens and let them know hey\nSomething terrible is about to happen and like you said it's been a long strange history the first one that they developed within the early fifties and at the time they called it ... which was a mixture of the words\nControl of electromagnetic radiation and what this would deal with upon activation\nThis warning system all the radio stations across the country would either shut down or switch formats over to broadcasting from the same two channels and it would be a recorded message from a guy who was a TV personality at the time and best friends with President Eisenhower Arthur Godfrey and he was a trusted voice he wouldn't\nRecord this public service announcement and there are no copies of his audio by the way I Love that very mysterious into and basically just warning everybody to stay calm and that Americans will survive whatever the nuclear war is going to happen\nI kind of like what happens now with the emergency alert system just a voice comes on and says hey it's an emergency comics hundreds cetera but this one was just funny because it was tied to TV personality oh Arthur Godfrey yeah so that was early on in the fifties and then another system that they had which I kind of thought was totally ineffective and I guess that's why they cancel it\nWas they were setting up this system of mothers and pink balloons what was that\nThey did it in a really small concentration because this was just a test this was never anything that was major Lee rolled out but in a small town of Charlotte, Michigan which happens to be near a civil defense agency headquarters at the time they set up with five hundred warning generators and with us they distributed to just over like a\nThousand devices to everybody in\nThe town and they were to plug this into one of their electrical outlets and then when they did the test of the system basically all the outlets are buzzing yeah and you were to go I guess your back yard and release a pink balloon\nAnd that pink balloons are supposed to signify that something terrible had happened\nI mean that's a totally crazy you can't trust people to be reliable enough to do that but it was supposed to alert Ninety percent of the country within thirty seconds that something crazy what's going on but there is no message attached to it it's just being balloons that means\nMass hysteria would break out so they cancelled that program 'cause it was going to be totally ineffective and then around the time of Nixon there was a new system that they're trying to get set up\nNixon and LBJ wanted to develop their own version of it which they called the decision information distribution system than did device hand what this led that it's something that you can plug into your TV like think about a fire stick in the seventies\nBasically the same concept and so you plug into your TV and what it would do was change the channel if you had some kind of warning set from Washington they would get on all the TVs and ... automatically change the channel to everybody be watching the same program informing you of what's going on it\nBut at the same exact time that this was happening and this is what's leading as to what happened yesterday the public lost all trust with the ...\nAnd because of what happened with Watergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their homes\nAnd as you said people were kind of ... they don't want the president to be able to bust your phone whenever he wants to\nJust to clarify if not the president's sitting in his office and saying I'm gonna send out this alert no ... there's a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that\nSo you know there's this long history that we have in this country of these emergency broadcast system\nThis was a new one I think it's actually a good idea everybody always has their cell phones on it were hyper connected you get notifications on your phone you can turn on TV and obviously if something's breaking it's gonna be on a news station\nBut it is good to have something direct when you're in your car you're just walking out for a hike it's good to have it come to you personally it's really about how to use it and then obviously what the emergency as hopefully aliens don't invade us\nIn the event that something were to happen and we get these alerts they say Americans have about eight to twelve minutes to seek shelter before something happens\nAnd in a life threatening situation that could help we just don't want to mess it up like Hawaii did the last time so that I didn't come out I was asking forgot about that there is among strange history of emergency alerts thanks Brenda thank you asking [laughter]\nYou're listening to the daily died weekend edition I'm ... and we'll be right back with more [noise] [noise] the biggest music\nFestival of the year and it's coming to their CWC I already all music\nMiss the iconic performances\n[noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] we'll come back to the daily died weekend edition\nNext up is my favorite story of the week really I Love stories about bank robbers and bank robberies\nIt takes a special person to have to go through all this stuff to finally come in and say I want to Rob a bank and then research and figure out how you're going to do it this guy in particular has an interesting story he won the lottery hit it big one Ninety million dollars\nAnd then blew through all of it he fell from the highest of highs\nAnd out of desperation turned to robbing banks Miranda you were actually lived in the area where some of the stuff was going around\nSanta Clarita native and I think like five out of his eight or nine banks that he hit were in that town and that's my home town so that's all anybody was talking about on Facebook for weeks with this peachy crews are banned it it was completely captivating and I'm ready for the Martin Scorsese as he good fellas style movie about this guy\nI remember seeing a lot of news stories about it when it's happening locally especially for you you know you think\nHave I ever run into that guy have I seen that getaway car and that's why they named him to peachy crews are better to do was get awake argues the stolen money that he got from the banks to buy this getaway car so we spoke to Natalie O'Neill she's a contributor to the Daily Beast and we started off by asking who was the P. T. crews are banned it Jim Hayes\nOh Jim have was a security guard who back in the late nineties one Ninety million dollar and the California state lottery\nAnd then over the course of the next decade sort of amazingly I managed to\nLose it all and then after everything it all came\nAccessible bank robber got away with ten of 'em in the LA area before he went then caught by the FBI last year\nSo I just had been talking for ten years in prison now and writing letter says he kind of ended up telling me everything that happened in between the time that he won the lottery and started kind of life of crime\nMy first question here is how do you strike up a relationship with a former bank robber guy in prison how do you broach the subject of tell me your story\nI called his lawyer and we had a good rapport lawyer then told me you know I\nMean she can they be the kind of guy wouldn't mind telling his story so why don't you send him a letter in prison and just a clean up for it he had already pled guilty I think it was waiting for\nActually catch him like when things turn I Know\nOne of the things was a huge mistake you hit the same bank twice\nOnce except play and then he is kicking himself for this now but then went back not too long\nLater hit the same bag but I tell her recognize them that were there before\nSo he fled without any money at that point and the lead investigator who kind of starting to get on that point said All right he failed I Know he's going to hit again and I know from ... it's not that I haven't gone out that I have\nA pretty good hunch that he located all\nAlong that same thoroughfare because here where all the thing that connect all of these banks so after\nThat failed robbery and they set up a camera along the highway and basically we're just looking for that knowing that he was probably going to strike and knowing what his vehicle was set it up and then we'll\nGo in and evidently he hit again and I don't think it it wasn't too much later entire the timeline and it was definitely less than a month\nAnd then knowing that he hit again just think that up with Ryan line and when the bank had occurred and then went through the camera footage they got a\nA help from a tip you know the bust at his house was very dramatic is walking out of the garage and they wanted him with a arts if teams and clock pistols and got him and boom that he was arrested you know being sentenced to thirty three months in prison three years of supervised release after that we know when he would get out\nAnd he had to pay back the money in restitution his release date is February twenty third twenty twenty so he still has a little bit of time in there what does he been doing with his time there and what are his plans after he gets released he's\nBeen making art in prison in trying every letter that he sent me had like some sort of elaborate picture on it like one hadn't Garfield on it is a cat and\nOh you have some of those on Twitter or something I've been so people can\nHe wants to publish a book at the end of this right\nHe's working on a on a book I Know that he's playing softball Ethan exercising and that is kind of like tapped into his more spiritual side he has a funny like upper ... view of all of it now and they said like look I'm cleaning so we're now kind of like fourth day talks for\nThe better he even said himself that it helped him more so than the money ever did and that's what I mean I Love these stories it's\nThat rise and fall it's coming into something and you know everybody internalize as like what would you do how would I react this happened to me and it's just a crazy story from\nBeing on the highest of highs to being so desperate that you have to turn to bank robbery and then obviously you know you get caught you know nobody ever gets away with anything at the end of it Natalie O'Neill contributor for the Daily Beast and freelance journalist thank you for joining us thank you

have to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nPrizes were also being awarded this past week\nOne of the more interesting a Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in medicine physiology or medicine they went to two people Dr James Alison and to a Sudoku on Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs immuno therapy quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking who were these Nobel Prize winners dreams Alison untouched to go\nAnd ... both of them that specialize in immunology studying the body's\nImmune system this turned out to be a critical part of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective and are effective in certain situations but\nThey can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells in the body along with cancer cells so that causes that causes all sorts of complications going back about Fifteen Twenty years there was another ... advance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutations in cancer cells now this\nImmune based approaches sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches\nTo treating catcher in the long time these two scientists working separately but in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that if used certain kinds of drugs\nTo target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells of T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nThat I mean what's so interesting about what they discovered was that the body's immune\nSystem as sort of its own natural check points or break so that it doesn't go overboard and attack that healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figured out how to exploit that and so they in some way they sort of latch on to the break about his immune system\nIn a way that helps and escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both scientists essentially take breaks off of the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these like ... you know commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he used to be true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think a lot of people have become aware of them through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter taking the true to and yes the TV commercials now are promoting\nThe use of ... and ... true to I think primarily lung cancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drones has shown some problem is\nThe research still obviously continues they're finding out that these things help treat those things but you know it's not a hundred percent success rate so the next step is to find out why it works the way it does work and then who would benefit most from it there's also a cost things some of these immunotherapy can cost upwards of a hundred grand per person so", "show_name": "Harvest Retirement Radio with Jay Peak", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "07"}
