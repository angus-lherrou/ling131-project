X. see that will restore your boot record\nIt's enough of a complicated process and I want you to follow the steps in order and accurately that I'm going to put a link in the show notes to or you could just Google it to a a a step by step because you want to do it accurately\nUm so you could also use this part to do it but that's a that's a little bit more tricky I'm not sure I'd recommend that I think you want to really use the built in windows recovery features so um\n[noise] yeah well yeah you can you give if you search for fix the MBR or fix you we have five booed you'll find a number of articles or don't do the ... I I Would\nSuggest not to do the one using the disc partition or cars that you can really mess up your disc if you start mess with it this partitions muse built in windows tools to do it you'll be better off\n[noise] [noise] yeah I've seen where it's ... it's a lingering in um [noise] um they they tell you that it would be a non Yulia by a ...\nYeah so even though you can't just delete the uh Linux partition and and be OK you got to kind of\nRestore everything the way it was windows recovery if you had the windows restore disc or window and ... you can also do recovery mode from there and fix it all up windows wants to boot wants to be the boom manager\nAnd is it sees Robin will say wait a minute and it'll it'll fix it all up so just put into your installed this core I'll put a link in the show notes to um\nSome set up tools that will do it this booth wreck is supposedly I have never tried this was supposedly fix it and in the future when you install Linux\n... you know you\nCan really this is not at all uncommon it's easy to get into trouble when you do a ... ... system very easy 'cause windows doesn't like to have another operating system on the hard drive\n'em and if you just delete Linux oh man you're in trouble so which is what you did I think so you you got to get a little bit more a little more work on here\nWill put it in that will put a or a guide and the shown us that should be able to save your baking speaking of Lennox I see that big news in the tech world just came out\nIBM is purchasing a Linux that for many years we recommended we use red hat remember red hat Linux you ever hear that name they become they were one of the first companies to actually make\nMoney distributing a free operating system called Linux or they're buying this man\nApparently it's worth a lot of money because IBM's buying red hat and a deal valued at thirty four billion dollars it's IBM's largest deal ever ever the third biggest in the history of us tech and it's kind of a premium red hats\nMarket capitalization it's about twenty billion so they're paying a fifty percent premium\nOn their market cap a hundred and Ninety dollars a share\nA that shows you how important Linux has become especially to uh enterprise to business and and and cloud business but while a that is a huge deal\nIBM buying red hat Linux clinics the free operating system clinics for thirty four billion dollar shows there's money and free for\nA while [noise] [laughter] I'm kind of kind of I'm taking my breath away [noise] [noise] ah\nI I don't I don't even know what to say [noise] a a show that they brought you by remote PC doesn't work with Lennox but it does work with Macintosh and windows is a great way to access a Mac or a PC remotely why would you want to do that oh I think a lot of reasons in fact\nThere's probably been a time when you say whoa I just got to work and I left to file on my computer at home or vice versa and you have to go back if you had remote PC running on those computers would be easy to get those files transfer files\nSecurely you can run any program it's great for trouble shooting I put remote PC and friends and family computers so I can but that I'm going to go over to their place fix their systems and the nice thing about remote PCs very affordable\nLess than six dollars a month for up to ten different computers but I can do one better\nActually Ninety percent better\nIf you go to a remote PC dot com and use the perma code Leo right now you'll get Ninety percent off your first year that's how confident they are this is a program you will love and use their basically giving it\nAlmost giving it away for the first year just to just so that you'll try it remote PC PC Magazine just gave it forced stars an excellent ratings saying it's effortless with a simple interface and learning curve fast performance users can easily transfer files\nBetween local of remote desktops and if you use the code Leo at remote PC dot com you'll get Ninety percent off Ninety percent off\nOne of the hill\nSean in Carlsbad, California hello Sean\nHello hello are already gone to the tech guy labs free no registration requires\nThank you thank you I I'm but didn't find what you want it I guess [laughter]\nWell I'm I Need it all [noise] um and ah my situation is that um [noise] I have for hard drives on my computer in each paid [noise] I I used to friends operating system disk and use my key from the H.\nP. okay so I could get\nYou know rid of all the extra or what they call it ...\nYeah and uh so now I have a nice ... stall of windows\nYeah well I have a situation six years down the road where my SST sixty gig SST is full [noise] so I Want to do a migration to a larger hard drive\nSure and I would love a fresh install for one thing but also I Want all\nMy settings last time I did this I lost everything from book marks to temporary files that let things run and and I had to take out all sorts of disks to reinstall\nStyle yeah the big house also can I Do both [noise]\nAh yes but not without a little bit\nI think the investigation now has centered in on Florida they think that a lot of the packages might have originated out of their\nAll do investigators naturally believe that some of the package math and delivered by hand or by Korea they now concluded that all had more likely than through the mail and a similarity across all of these packages is that the return address was the office of\nCongresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of course the name was also misspelled\nBut there are a lot of similarities that we're seeing with all of these packages they each had about that first class stamps\nOn that and they were very heavily tape in manila envelopes science with bubble wrap all the mailing labels were printed on a computer so the bottom line here at that uh fortunately no one was hurt but authorities are still\nUnsure of why these bombs seemingly to be structured similarly to python didn't go off and now the question is whether that was because of their intention to simply incite fear and not harm or if there was a technical law that prevented it from going up\nAnd because of the similarities all the with the packaging and the actual devices themselves they do believe they're all connected\nOr we don't know if it's a single person or group of people but they're all connected that way I Know experts have said that because the devices did not go off there is a treasure trove of forensic clues that they can look at anything from DNA fingerprints\nAnd that's obviously where the investigation is starting I mean they're even looking at video when the packages first made it into the postal system you know everything is tracked by video when it starts in the postal system so they're trying to like retroactively go back to see where it started and if there's any video the person may be dropping an offer something\nIt's almost like they're trying to start from the end of the construction of the device then work their way back\nSo for now the packages hop either a rise are still being sent to Quantico the lab and Virginia and what they're going to try to do is traced this as it as that could include DNA or fibers found on the packages are friends on the back of the\nStance or on the pay they'll be getting this assembling\nThese packages and attempt to trace them back to their fender and so now they're going to try and see whether the constructor of these seemingly pipe bombs whether they left them sort of\nThing that chart whether they lack some sort of air enemy wiring and maybe that was sort of their trade so there are a lot of clues that investigators now have to put together they just have a big puzzle I had at that\nAnd we learned a little bit more about the devices themselves they said they were made out of PVC pipe covered with black tape beach I like a small battery some wires maybe some broken glass for maximum damage but is there anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very few details about the ... the the fight that they were saying that these are capable of being lied explosive whether or not they are it's still unclear we know that they have taken X rays that the it's explicit\nThan are examining those and are going through the as wiring and batteries and the overall material that these are constructed from\nIt's hard to ignore who the targets are George Soros the Clintons the Obamas CNN and John Brennan Eric Holder Debbie Wasserman Schultz as you've said is the return address for all of the ten devices\nRepresentative Maxine Waters Joe Biden Robert Deniro these are all high profile Democrats and the critics of the president the administration how was the president been responding to\nThe president has largely been hunting blame off of himself and his rhetoric and back onto the media so that we thought different Trump rally from his normal show on Wednesday night it was absent from\nThe lock her up chants while he was speaking are fake news represented says as he points\nBack at the end of the ... men criticizes the media and the crowd goes wild he did however at that rally\nCalls for the media to unite the country he also tweeted on Thursday again blaming the media for that he said that have very big part of the anger that we see in our society is caused by basically fake\nNews and that it's gotten so bad that it's beyond description so what we see here is something very standard of the president uh these days is that he is not wanting to take the blame for himself I Would imagine that he would be\nPretty careful that could impact and in the mid term that works you will embrace that the blame for that and putting it back to one of his easiest targets which is the media\nYeah it's going to be interesting to see how it all shakes out the investigation is ongoing no details are going to be coming in and changing every day and the man hunt is on to see who or what group might have Sundays out\nThank you very much Lauren Meyer reporter for access thanks for joining us thank you so much [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nElection season and you know you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this year for political campaigns to reach voters is not through these ads on social media it's not ... it's not these robo calls\nIt's flooding cell phones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate the rules on automated both texting it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McKay but he's a tech reporter at ... for more on this\nAnd these are what are called peer to peer messages so use these robo calls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial media can dial more people because it's the machine during an island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls robots heck's these are actually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line and it becoming more popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use where it'll auto film whatever message it is the key as you were saying the peer to peer these campaigns need somebody to literally hit send for every single one and they say that these people can since thousands of them and our\nRight I mean they use these platforms on both the left in the rye problems like open sesame for us all opens that's me on the right hospital or to on the on the left to send these text and it's essentially building a a platform to do that at scale and of course it's not entirely unlike phone banking we\nAll know that people can go and they can call and they have political candidates often a common space with other people supporters so it's not entirely on like that in terms of being another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rape of like about Ninety percent basically if they send it to you you're more than ... percent likely to actually open it and read some of it at least so the the engagement is there\nAnd open to me which is one of these providers to Ninety percent of tech method is I read within five minutes and I mean I think that is in ... we know how impactful that could be given that we get\nSo much political email so much political mail in this election in every election now and there's so much messaging that any way to break through the voters is a big deal for campaign and\nThis is the daily died weekend edition we'll be right back with more about personalized political text messages\nAnd how to get them to stop it time for ... gestures to get the recognition\nIs there for their role influencing pop culture and public opinion and you decide which podcasts are the best way to reduce the heart radio broadcasts award for capital one\nBecause it's like hey you want to meet for dinner and hypothetical your phone could say yeah I Do and my concern is that changes fundamentally so many aspects of social interaction if we are letting our computers make those decisions for us\nBut I also have just a logistical intractable a question about how something like that would work I mean if my phone agrees to a guarantee for me\nHow do I make sure I Know that I has agreed to that and what if my friend enter and I'm not there and they're pissed off at me right and I the one to blame or as my phone to blame it ... it sounds like a nightmare\nYeah or you're just talking to a friend in person and then you double book herself because your phone did it for you\nI mean you know this is like you say we were talking about black mirror and stuff but this leads us further beyond that into\nThe movie with Joaquin Phoenix and her and then all these am I going to be talking to each other and then leave everybody at the end of it you know I mean I just love all of this future talk but it's not so far off anymore these AI things are advancing so fast you mentioned the law passed in California that they have to disclose their ...\nBecause things are moving so fast and all that regulatory stuff is always so far behind\nSome people are very against this chat bought disclosure law\nBecause they think that it might quiet or tiny innovation\nIn the ... market which actually you know these kind of automated tax service does have a real utility and so there's a lack\nOf regulation and then there may also be knee jerk need to regulate out of fear is a very uncharted territory I Would say um but we are all ready you know it's serious it's also you know we've been talking about the funny\nOr unexpected are weird ways in which these box will affect society but also bad actors can take advantage of these thoughts and turning into stand machines or other and the various uses and\nAt the moment we are at the mercy of the tech companies to try to design these product in such a way as to minimize their potential for abuse but we just\nBasically crossing our fingers now but I tried that\nAnd the trust is not always there so in the meantime the where the robots Emily ... senior writer for wired thank you very much for joining us and\n[noise]\nDon't forget to join us on social media really dive pod on Twitter and anytime something's leave us a comment give us a rating and tell us a story that you're interested in\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts mosque rumors and this is the daily died in the [noise]\n[noise] you can hear\n[noise]\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week I don't have the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] for the ongoing stories that has been happening for a few weeks now is that of the\nCentral American migrants caravan that it's making his way from Honduras there's members from Guatemala and El Salvador as well the Trump Administration is planning to dispatch about eight hundred or more active duty troops to the southern border\nTo help stop the flow of migrants into the country defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops of the border bolstering the national guard forces that are already there\nThe additional troops would provide logistical support to the border patrol the plan is not yet been finalized or formerly announced but it is expected to happen for more on the migrant carbon we spoke to Ted has and he's an immigration reporter for Politico and we started off by talking about the president's reaction to the Caribbean and the implications for the midterm elections\nWe've seen the president talked tough on this issue and this is nothing new I mean this goes back to the last time there was a caravan back in April I mean I think\nThe one difference we have here is we're now at the doorstep of November's midterm elections and this was a political issue for him obviously he really wants to make it about his policies and the need for a border wall versus what the Democrats stand for what he characterizes as open borders\nHe's saying that these countries you know under a self Salvador Guatemala they're not doing enough to keep these people there I Know Mexico's National Guard there so you know some military guys they put up a roadblock ate at one point but then they tore down right away\nI guess maybe there was too many people are they knew they weren't going to be able to handle it the countries are doing something maybe just not enough and like I said now he wants to start cutting aid I think last year these three countries had more than a combined five hundred million dollars in funding from the U.S I think so far this year it's been about two hundred million dollars\nIn aid has been shrinking in recent years to begin with back in twenty Seventeen it was\nSomewhere around seven hundred million to mostly to these three Central American countries Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and then in twenty Eighteen down to six hundred and Fifteen million and now it's been proposed by both the house and the Senate to bring it down somewhere in the five hundred million dollar range and and and the Trump Administration was actually asking for even lower\nSomewhere in four hundred million so even before all this happened President Trump was already proposing to cut aid to the Central American countries so that in itself is nothing new I mean what is interesting though is that he doesn't have an hour to do that on his own and these are bills passed by Congress and Congress will consider what amounts to give in Central American aid when the time comes\nAnd the president being very forceful on this stuff does give some political cover to Republicans who have to push this through because the Democrats are going to be on the opposite side of it with regards to the mid term do you know he's saying\nWhenever you see these people come across in these criminals and unknown middle Easterners and everything she the Democrats in mind we have to change our crappy immigration laws so he makes it about the midterms and everything and he provides a little covered by being forceful but is\nThere not much political will on the part of Congress to do something I I'm there was some immigration bills that tried to pass this past year and none of them went through even some of the ones that the White House was backing\nI mean I think you really need to consider his words in the context of where we are right now only being two weeks away from the mid term and I think this was an issue that is really important to Republican voters and it\nSeems like it's going up an interest in recent weeks and less so for Democrats essentially as a way for them to mobilize their base to get them out to the polls now whether\nAny of these proposals you know border wall flashing funding to Central America rewriting asylum laws I mean these are all really big projects and even maybe a year ago a little less than a year ago when Congress was working in a bipartisan fashion to address them\nThey really struggled to do so and they weren't able to advance any legislation and the White House would pose the bills that had the most support\nSo it's hard to imagine that after the midterms with Democrats likely to take back some ground in the house is not when it entirely that they'd come back to the table and work out a better deal\nWhat has been the reaction from the leaders of these countries Honduras Guatemala El Salvador I Know the Mexican the incoming Mexican president has suggested that the U.S Canada and Mexico work out some funding development for poor areas of Central America in southern Mexico where are these companies trying to do to reduce the type of migration\nThe presidents of the the northern triangle countries were up in Washington DC not too long ago for a summit convened by the U.S and Mexico jointly\nTo talk about these very issues\nAnd you know for the most part they're open to cooperating on security issues but there are clearly limitations in some cases those are economic limitations and not having the funding to do it and that's I mentioned before with us funding is being caught towards these kind of projects and Central America right now and then in other cases it's political and it's because of\nPolitical instability in their home country I mean I'm Doris in particular is an example where I'm the president there one Orlando Hernandez is a strong us ally but one\nNarrow reelection and doesn't really have much of a mandate to govern you definitely have different\nSituations in each country in different capacities as to how they're able to address this\nTen has an immigration reporter for Politico thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having me [noise]", "show_name": "Harvest Retirement Radio with Jay Peak", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "28"}
