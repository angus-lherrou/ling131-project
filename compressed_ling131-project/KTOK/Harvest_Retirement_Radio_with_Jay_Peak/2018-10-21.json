T. M. I.\nL. L. E. hook up aged because that's how she used to have it connected to her old TV she gave her old TV and sell because that you are without work anymore was getting I Am at the edge but now she wants to see what they are what\nHGF my only connect it to her computer monitor and um you know displaced so I'm thinking that might be something wrong with by age ...\nKind of fight just throw this thing out please [laughter] you're going to spend more money trying to figure out what's wrong and you're going to get a sub\nOptimal solution anyway and it's going to break again um there are so many companies that do this my recommendation would be to look at ... dot com\nOr that they don't have outdoor cameras at a wise cam which is\nThe least expensive but I've got these wise cameras everywhere they're so inexpensive I actually have one pointing out a window it can then it's indoor so that's okay but if she doesn't have a window I Would go to ... dot com get a they have outdoor nest cameras that worked fabulously\nOr you can see what's going on at all times you'll get alerts on your smartphone you don't have a DVR because they store the video is so much better uh all ... as long as she's got why it'll work just fine and she needs somewhere to plug it in but obviously she's got that for the old\nSystem or if you go to the wire cutter dot com and you look at their recommendations for the best outdoor security cameras they also say ... outdoor hundred sixty five dollars for the camera hundred sixty five dollars from Amazon that's you know that's going to be less than ... than fixing that DVR\nAnd you can get multiple cameras if you want to ... uh two hundred eighty dollars on Amazon and then she pays the nest service I Can't remember what it is it's not not horribly expensive and it's great because well I'll give you an example\nWe were um we were in Japan or last spring and I was just looking at the camera see what's going on in the front yard and I saw my mailbox I have one of those rural mailboxes had been knocked over I thought oh man so I go back\nAnd I was able to find exactly what happened at a car plowed into it did a little more research I have a doorbell camera from ring I was able to see the person coming getting out of the car ring or doorbell oh night she wanted to get it fixed I figured out who it was it was a\nWoman delivering newspapers next door and she was rolling up newspapers and she wasn't paying attention she planning her mailbox\nTalk to her I said don't worry about it we wanted a new mailbox anyway but I have a complete record of that I Can't tell you how useful\nIt is I have several outdoor cameras or we have outdoor cameras here as well at the studio\nAnd so and it's not expensive and it's so much better so all of these old systems where you had the big old thing that looks like a ... a camcorder and the wiring and it's going into a DVR which is recording in looping over and over again all of this is completely obsolete\nUh I think it's just nutty just to to to\nPut any more money into it because I can guarantee is going to cost you more\nThan getting a a given that security camera hundred sixty five dollars a done you have to have wife by and you have to power a you plug it in um it was pretty easy to install you know takes takes submitted to install comes with all the screws and stuff on\nThe other one if you want lights the ring dot com they sell 'em\nThere and as I said they're sponsored republic cast they sell a flood light camera that has a camera for like always work at night or the ring you have a microphone and the speaker and an alarm that you can bring you could talk to people if there's somebody outsiders store they because they get out of here you have kids and that scares the heck out of

code eco tank Leo check out\nYou never we appeared and that's all kinds of with the backdrop of increasing repression in Saudi Arabia especially against anyone who speak out against the changes or any initiatives that\nThe crown prince Mohammed bin Oman has been pursuing a kind of strange because he's also been discount contested and putting them reforms that are very much being cheered by the west that he had tried to cultivate this reputation at the progressive as a reformer in this deeply conservative Muslim country but he's than\n... with this very authoritarian harsh crackdown on dissent and this was one of the reasons that John Hall I shelled she had gone very disillusioned with the confidence I was writing columns attacking him and so the steam has\nUpset the government and of course the latest reports are a bit different about where things are going to or we'll get to that and\n... as you were saying how show gee in his early writings was a very supportive almost a go between between a lot of journalists and then when the crown prince came a little more into power and obviously would be next in line he changed his tone so obviously the you know the crown prince did not like any of that\nAnd they're saying that for something a hit or something like that to have been taken out against him it would have had to been ordered by the crown prince himself that's what leads to all of this international intrigue now and\nWhat happened and why was the order to be killed or captured or abducted or something\nOne of the updates now is that they're saying that Saudi officials are preparing some type of report to acknowledge that ... his death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong\nThere still saying that things can change in this report is not solid yet but that's kind of what we're hearing now\nRight so this is the CNN reports and what's really striking about it if it's this comes out to be the case if they do report that indeed\nI show she died while in Saudi custody first of all you know let's not forget the Saudis originally said that he was fine and you know it shows that apparently they lied from the beginning and if they now say well we only meant to interrogate him we didn't lead to kill him it was an accident\nI guess that's not out of the realm of possibility is something that President Trump I'm listening to indicate that it's the has the story that he would accept and it's not impossible I mean because because the Saudis all that they do have a history is perhaps China\nHoax people to come back to the king more rendition them I cannot and they don't really have a history of killing people\nIf he dies because of harsh interrogation techniques let's just say that's just something pretty serious it's not like they\nWere probably just trying to question this takes that step further and where's the body\nOne of these people that apparently went in had a bone saw that's why they think that he was dismembered and the president has made that Saudi Arabia one of our allies in that area the reports are that\nJared Kushner is very close friends with the crown prince also and you know they're trying to open up the area to business and things like that so I don't know if it would put a halt to it but it would really severely impact what's going on there\nAnd this is what's extraordinary them I'm I'm being told oh that like inside idea right if people are a bit frustrated with it because they're saying the Saudis have stayed with the United states has so many different things we cooperate with them on every level why should this one\nGuy this one incident got all all that and there's no indication in the ... to by any means and the relationship with I mean that's not even I don't think any administration wouldn't affiliated over and over this\nBut you have to remember it's not just any other opinion writer journalism and is that is very prominent he knew people in many many people in the U. S. foreign policy community he wrote for a very powerful newspaper ... you know frankly like when it comes down to it often when you have a single face\nOr single name that often captures the imagination of the public for more than when you say a thousand people were killed today in this war you know [laughter] so it becomes very emotional issue I Know members of Congress are very very upset about this on both sides I mean they're really mad\nAbout this and we're still waiting for any type of evidence are saying that turkey might have a lot of evidence but they're not sharing any of it just yes\nAnd the elderly people works or not the most reliable Mary ... either they have to do really well with everything that\nA lot of people are making something out of her show jeeze apple watch saying that he set it up to record and it went back to the cloud into his iPhone which is fiance had and there might be some type of recording of what that interrogation sounded like yeah\nBut the other theory on that is that for the one that three out there because they don't want to admit that they have the Saudi conflict wired\n... foreign affairs correspondent for Politico thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me\nThere has been a ton of development since that interview that we did with in the hall that kind of sets up with the whole story is about after that Turkish officials were leaking all sorts of stories to the media part of it was they said they had audio recordings of what happened inside the Saudi constantly\nThey said that Mr ... was dead within minutes and within two hours\nAll of the killers are gone there so there was a Fifteen person hit team that went in there Miranda tell us what some of these gruesome details were because\nIt plays like a spy movie all this secret shady stuff happening in these political constantly it's you know it it's crazy the secrecy that happens in there that they think that they can get away with this kind of stuff would have some of these details of how they say he died\nYeah and like you said there were Fifteen people waiting for him for hours to show up and they knew what they were going to do they have this all planned out from the beginning and like you said he was dead within minutes they separate his fingers and cut his head off\nAnd asked they cut off his head and dismembered his body there was a doctor a forensic who had been brought along so that he could assist with the deception and the disposal of some of the body parts and he had some advice for them including one was to listen to music as he put his own headphones on because that's what he like\nTo do to try to ease the tension when quote doing such work\nThey said that he was dead within minutes but how quick and fast the torture was you know I'm assuming and what were those minutes ... right exactly I'm assuming some of those minutes were spent cutting fingers off I Want to cut off your head that's kind of messy in the end of it but yeah for the doctor\nTo want to be wearing these headphones and listening to music just the run of the craziness of what's going on in front of you is just ridiculous\nReports that the one of the members of the Fifteen person assassin team world in there with the bones are right that is going to make some a gross noises\nExactly you don't want to hear this is turning to just a mess on the diplomatic side\nThe United states is struggling with how to respond to this the world is crying out that Saudi Arabia and the crown prince is directly involved in this new Trump Administration wants to tread very lightly they are an ally we do a lot of business with them they buy a lot of weapons from us in the billions of dollars\nAnd the president doesn't want to endanger that President Trump spoke to reporters and acknowledged that it certainly looks as though he's dead now what else did the president saying how what else is going on the administration\nIn addition to his comments that it quote certainly looks as though\nHer show jazz is dead he threatened very severe consequences if the Saudis are found to have murdered him and before he spoke\nTreasury secretary Steve Mnuchin pulled out of a major upcoming Saturday investment conference Mike Pompeo has been over there interviewing people trying to figure out what's gone on and he even advised that the Saudis should be given a few more days to finish and make public they're credible investigation before\nThe U.S decides how or if they want to respond\nTo give them a few more days to think about how they want to cover this I'm ... I mean there's still a lot of evidence now they're releasing video surveillance of this Fifteen Percent hit teams walking in to the consulate walking out you know with a huge briefcase will get into some of those details in just a minute\nWe never saw ... walk you know and\nHe never walked out himself this investment conference that's happening there in a Steven Mnuchin pulling out there's all sorts of companies that have pulled out\nNetflix came on the scene and they were doing a lot of movies and I'm now transitioned into all sorts of original programming T. V. shows and movies you're going to have choices all over the place and it's going to be tearing you away from the traditional TV cable bundle\nNo the other thing for an end or at that for really long there was a lot for TV network own themselves they think they should be that far and wide\nNet and not because they think well I think it's something that with their own parents ... off of that now what is your favorite fat cells I no longer right as a reason for it they want to make sure that the way that they can undermine that competition like keeping their intellectual property\nHeating their high a price parents that that if you want to know where you can only go to that and you know a lot of people think that like game of Thrones Breaking Bad is wearing family get that little kid you really want that kind of had the price of the\nFamily and that and by that\nIt's really interesting and but there will be no shortage of things to watch now so it's going to be crazy how it all shakes out Sarah Fisher media reporter for Axios thank you very much for joining us radical\nTactics [noise]\nDon't forget to join us on social media at daily diet pod on Twitter and daily podcast on\nLeave us a comment if it's raining and tell us a story that you're interested in [noise]\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts [noise]\nTime Oscar mirrors and this is the daily dive speaking [noise]\nGrab your costume I enjoy you know junior he'll be normally be a monster dash five gay and run on October twenty first tenant leaves me I'm In a bar and learn more and right and you're now at ... dot com backslash junior league it'll be Norman\nHere's a crazy question do you want to grow your business [noise] new ... been try radio radio reaches more people each week than TV or any other medium checkout I heart okay the advertising dot com you get started today my heart okay the advertising dot com\nRadio one thousand Katie okay\n[noise]\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week don't forget to check on the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without\nThe noise [laughter]\nI think one of the stories it's captured everybody's attention this week is that of the lottery the mega millions jackpot is the largest that it's ever been Powerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also\nI think between the both of them they're going to be given away one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery Miranda if you won the lottery who would be the first person you'd call\nA ... I think I called my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been in Samy mouthy forever [laughter] and so she's the only person I Know who would not try to get money out of yeah and she would know that people to call the ... maybe that last over generations\nThat's funny I bet you're going to say something like hey now I'm as rich as you guys but [laughter]\nI I mean I might say that the experts say that the first person you shouldn't be calling is actually a lawyer because there's a lot of stuff\nThat you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lot of times in states your name has to be publicly announced you can't get away I think there is only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know\nGood luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning or one in three hundred and two point six million or ... for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million so and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight quandary really and then I ... followed by Fifteen zeroes so and I miss the odds are crazy we spoke to Rodrigo told her ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer for us and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call a lawyer towards winning a big I spoke to a uh Jason Carlin he's an attorney based in New York He's actually the self proclaimed lottery lawyer he's represented more than thirty lottery winners as ... eleven\nI saw him at his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy\nI guess you'd say the expert on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much the first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners and basically protecting them from a lot of the pitfalls of winning so much money and such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first and the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option it's five hundred and forty eight million dollars is\nStill a ton of money one of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it's like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jackpot for the mega millions was also pretty large so people the the question that I get most frequently is\nCan I claim my jackpot anonymously if I win\nSo I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to and encouraged to file what's called the public record request and through that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nBe a director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game\nSo we want people's names out there you know this is\nWe want people to know who's getting the money that they've spent on the statewide damn this lottery and you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a allow the er an entity to claim the pride rent James carry his his name the director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine you can do that of course\nAnd they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nWow I I guess may maybe the only thing in that is that you could ... your name coming out because the the trustworthy L L C might get first building a there is only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota\nOhio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere\nYou're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately before you announce close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skip town if you can write when they're gonna announce it so that you're not there and you know you work in the media as you've seen when\nAnything major happens in the news\nThe media starts hunting down any pictures that they can of you or you know all the details because everybody wants to know so you know some experts is to close all that stuff down just to help avoid it\nThat's one of the first tips that I've gotten from multiple experts is yet tried to get off social media because like you said that's the first place that not just reporters look but\nPeople that might want to start contacting you for money for charity and that's another issue is that you know a lot of charities that will tend to reach out to jackpot winners they all the ... but then there are a lot they're bogus that's what they think Carlin the lottery lawyer was telling me is you know you kinda have to keep it to yourself and more weight in\nWays than just one not just a matter of not talking to people and telling them about it but yes scrub your social media if you can you have your phone number out there try to get it down just so that again like you said kind of lay people doing that 'cause especially in New Jersey inevitably it it's probably going to happen and your name will be out there but at least
