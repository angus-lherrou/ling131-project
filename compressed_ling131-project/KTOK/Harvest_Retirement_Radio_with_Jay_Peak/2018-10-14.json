know ... ... feels like a President Trump is a kindred spirit to him almost he feels like he's the same type of guy who's criticized a lot but\nCapable of doing great things we spoke to Olivia new species a Washington correspondent for New York magazine she was in the oval office when Carney was there with the president's a we spoke to her about her impressions of that\nAnd then she was also

up with players like Emmett Smith Russell Marilyn Kevin Smith and Darren ... stature\nI hard radio weekends for each time capsule [noise]\n\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week [noise] don't forget to check on a daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nOne of the most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian causes but not that had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed and they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soy use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old\nAh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space acts and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubles Russian space program\nIt's the only link that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rod pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nThis was a flight as you said a woman astronaut when us that's not one cause not go up the space station and they are and the Soyuz spacecraft which also writes up on a rocket at the same name\nThat was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of group members are already up the\nSpace station to we're going to come back now the space station always has a Soyuz capsule attached up there just in case so that's their get out of jail free card if they need to come home in an emergency but the official seal of approval on that are coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap\nOut the crew or not there's a church didn't\nSo apparently what happened is it made it through about two minutes of flight ... staging first said just second stage and what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally have the drugs they dream but it's been a long time since I've looked at that tells me there might have been something going on with one of the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened to the staging either an engine\nFailed to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the first stage to drop pre properly\nSo for one reason or another they had to abort now the rockets designed to be able to do that\nAnd they all have been since the early space age book on our side and the bread the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really been having a board option until much later than when you abort your ground control punches a big red button and\nA capsule let's go from the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely powerful and just burn for a few seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the abort but it's like getting slammed with a block of concrete right in the face\nThey said they were forced to do a ... entry what exactly does that mean because they said that during that stuff that they didn't have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of a what's going on under\nIt's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot\nAnd even at a normal retrieve you're you're looking at maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so the ballistic rich remains this is what they did in the very early space age days back and mercury and\nAbbas stock on the Soviets I'd normally when a space capsule comes back in it glides a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle and away the shield loses items such a way and the and they use guidance rockets to ... themselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways not heat shield so it's kind of this Shiloh gradual reentry that gives you four to\nFive sometimes six cheese\nA ballistic ... means you've got up over the top of the arc that whatever speed you had goes away and then you come back straight down like a bullet in because you're not scrubbing off any of that energy by moving sideways you're generating a possibly nine cheese which is a lot\nThe U.S astronaut Nick hey it was his first mission what are riding with a crazy turn of events for him\nWhat a rotten afternoon huh and they showed some video the fat\nAnd at the point that whatever happened happened that started I guess the rock I started to vibrate significantly you can see these two guys in their hands are flap on around like they're trying to learn how to apply them and it's really it's almost comical but realize that it was a top ride because normally that doesn't happen so they're really they said they were they were weightless at one point even before\nThey hit the panic buttons and cut out", "show_name": "Harvest Retirement Radio with
