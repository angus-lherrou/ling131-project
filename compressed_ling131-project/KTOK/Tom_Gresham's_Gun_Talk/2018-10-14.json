{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "Pays aren't looking for philosophy they're looking for signs they are looking for all that stuff they are looking for something real\nAnd I think that's a crucial idea for us to get in mind when Paul came to people to preach he preached about the very real Christ to walk the streets who ... who walk through Jerusalem and ... he'll the sick people who was crucified who died on the steak was buried and rose again the third day and it was real\nNot philosophy\nAnd he goes on to say to the great did you see how you you're calling rather and you know to have you noticed looking around that they're not many wise man after the flesh\nNot many noble not many mightier called\nGod has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the whys and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and you know it's not that is true to say that God has a sense of humor you can often see it and things because he seems to take a certain amount of delight in sticking things right under\nPeople's knows and they can't see them they're they're in plain sight and they can't find them he may have played a game when you're a kid cold hide the symbol and they still had been bulls in those days when I was young\nAnd you take some small object and you place it in plain sight in a room and the question is how long it will take a person to come into the room and look and look and look and see this thing that is right there in plain sight\nWhat God has chosen the base things of the world things that are despised says he chose and things which are not to bring to nothing the things that are why would God now go through this whole exercise oh here's the answer that no flash should glory in his presence\nSo there is a key right there\nIsn't that you have to have particular inside it doesn't that mean that you have to be smart it doesn't mean that you have to be able to reason better than somebody else for if you could do that and if that's how you came to it then you can be proud of yourself\nDoesn't work that way it works strictly by believing God he\nSays I Love him are you in Christ to of God is made to us wisdom and righteousness and sank to vacation in redemption\nSo that according as it is written he the glories let him glory and the lord as opposed to himself for some philosopher or some guru listen care for this message is coming up and I'll be right back with more\nFree CD of this radio program that you can share with friends and others write or call this ... and request a program title Christian mysticism a\nRight to born to weigh a post office box by six zero\nWhite House Texas Seven five seven nine one\nOr coal toll free one eight eight eight Bible forty four\nBeds one eight eight eight to four to five three or four\nPoll continues in first grade the it's too and I read them when I came to you did not come with excellent sea of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God fry determined not to know anything among you saved Jesus Christ and him crucified\nNow I suppose I have to take part his word that he was not a great speaker reading his letters makes it a little hard to believe but never mind I think what he meant was that he was into the real not into clever argumentation I'm Talking about real stuff here\nI was with un weakness in fear and much trembling in my speech in my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and the power\nWhy did I Do that\nThat your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God well we want is not for you to be buying some stupid philosophy we want you to be believing in the real the real God he does say\nWe do speak the wisdom of God in a mystery that's been hidden from before the world into our glory which none of the princes of this world knew if they have they wouldn't have crucified the lord of glory\nBut as it is written I has not seen nor ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of a man the things which God has prepared for\nThem that love him what a powerful statement he makes now we have received he said not the spirit of the world but the spirit of God so we could know the things that are freely given to us\nBy God\nHe goes on to talk about how the natural man doesn't receive the things the spirit of God they're foolishness to them because they're spiritually discern but want this Paul means when he said things that are spiritually discern well later on in second grade at the end see we're right\nThis chapter for and therefore since through God's mercy we have this ministry\nWe do not lose heart rather we have renounced secret and shameful ways we do not use deception we do not distort the word of God on the contrary by setting forth the truth plainly\nWe commend ourselves to every man's conscience and the side of God and can you get that forget about mysticism forget about secret stuff forget all that stuff Paul says we're setting forth the truth reality plainly\nAnd even if our gospel is they all did veil to those who are perishing the God of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ the image of God even though it's right there in plain sight they can't see it\nFor we preach ourselves Paul said Jesus Christ as the lord and ourselves as servants you're servants for Jesus sake\nPaul he had nothing\nBut the mindset of the people who heard him made all the difference the gospel was not hidden it was just that men did not want to deal with\nThey close their eyes not only that but the God of this world had blinded them to the real\nThey were made to believe that what they see\nIs not the truth it reminds me of this famous Groucho Marx line and you got to believe your eyes are you going to believe me\nBut what do you do\nYou drive to meaning the innate desire for meaning to live years into this comes up\nGives a flat brick wall what do you do then\nWell you can manufacture your own meaning you can begin to listen to your own feelings may be after all your feelings represent the spirit speaking to you or perhaps you can find a guru and follow him someone who claims hidden meaning that he can reveal to the chosen few\nYou know it's an odd truth than many people not satisfied with the real which is right in front of their eyes try to look for something else takes the obvious story of what happened on nine eleven\nWhat really happened seems so unreal so incredible so unsinkable\nThat some people think there must be another explanation\nSo conspiracy theories come to the rescue and ascribe a hidden secret meaning to all of this\nIt's not clear to me that the conspiracy theories have any more credibility than the real story but never mind\nAnd I think it is this drive to meaning that lead some people into Christian mysticism the real is not enough for them to have to have a deeper meaning a more personal meaning\nBut it's important to remember that meaning must always be tested against what is real and nothing could be more real than the ten commandments nothing could be more real than the teaching in the example of one Jesus Christ\nThe struggle with life can be hard enough with these to go by but it is a battle that can be one\nBut the battle has to be one on a real playing field against real challenges mysticism is their retreat from the real in effect abandons the struggle for real life and seeks meaning they think is denied to others in Jesus Christ\nNow why would they do that\n[laughter] how can they want a bang you know they want more gun control and uh to do that you have to sort of push this myth that ... that the rights of the the right to bear arms as a collective right you know for people in militias and things like that and not something for the individual such do that you have to [noise]\nYou have to basically revised or throw out the history of the gun in America which was a an individual right from the beginning reason they didn't talk about it all the time was because it was like such such as a non starter it was like breathing the air or something like you know we're going to church you know people\nOn them and had them and no one really question that right until probably the Nineteen thirties\nAnd it's interesting you put it that way because you're right way back the idea of you have a gun you have a gun for self protection for providing food for protecting your family that was trying to explain that to someone would be like saying we're here let me explain to you that we need to breathe\nLike everybody would go ... or yeah why are we even talking about\nI mean we wouldn't even and people on the sort of outskirts of society for instance I mean they wouldn't be able to survive without guns it would have been impossible for them and [noise]\nUm you know I mean I you know the idea that that some government person would calmer the state would come and say you have to ask for permission to defend yourself\nIs the antithesis of what the whole constitution is about in many ways I think how people treat the second amendment tells you a lot about how they think about freedom in general and uh that's why it's so important and that's why it's the first freedom\nBut it's interesting you say that I like that where the guy how people treat the second amendment tells you what they think about freedom and I find in the discussions we have a lot of people in America who\nI put in my armchair psychologist role here I think maybe they know that they are not protecting themselves in their family they're not doing everything they should do and the fact that I Am and\nOthers are stands in stark evidence in contrast to what they're doing and if they can make sure that we're not taking care of ourselves than they do have to feel bad about not taking care of themselves and their family is that is that going too far\nI think that that's that's definitely the case with some people I think that's definitely part of it I think the other part of it is that a lot of those people that you're mentioning\nAnd others um view the government very differently as they view it as a protector all the time and they don't want you to rely on yourself because the more you rely on the state the more important to state is and that's what they want it to be in your life\nIt's already too important in my estimation already too big and too invasive but they wanted to be more of that and I think guns are one of the things that are very tangible thing that it can take away from me or it may not allow you to have something that they view as unsafe [noise]\nUm and it can be one used by bad people but of course not when it's used by the right people in their laws typically just inhibit good people from having guns not bad people so\nWhen you talk and you've done a lot of research in this book is titled a book by the way first freedom a ride to Americans enduring history with the gun from revolution and it's basically the history of the gun and roller blade in America throughout when you talk to people do you find that there are\nA considerable number of people who really don't\nKnow what's the role fly was or I think it was much much less than it actually was [noise]\nThat it's much less I mean I'm In Washington DC right now and I would say that most people I mentioned the sort of stories of the gun ... never knew about how important it was I mean just take some takes him coal for instance that people understand\nHow what a an incredible personality was how he changed the world with a interchangeable parts long before Henry Ford that did anything of that nature and they don't understand that he was sort of the first industrial is that guns are such a big deal and that\nYou know he sold diamond and changed the way that we sell things to people and he went to England in open a factor all the things I I don't take that\nHistorians glorify him in the way they do other inventors for instance because it was a gun and they view guns in a you know in a negative way\nMore you know once you started your research you realize that the industrial revolution in America hinged upon firearms you know was interchangeable parts it was all of these advancements that we take for granted and that as you say people attribute to Henry Ford\nNo no no our Sam coke was doing it a room and who was doing it people making guns were doing it long before\nAnd that was you know gun ballet was where the industrial revolution actually took place\nThe the first industrial revolution driven by gun manufacturing I mean there are other things involved but a gun manufacturers were on the you know the cutting edge of the of the technology of the day you know Sam Cole had his factory in Hartford and it was almost it reminds me when I read about it it reminds me a little bit like Google Earth\nSomething today where people lived on campus and they were very immersed in like the business aspect of it but [noise] um he was an amazing man and it wasn't just him there were many engineers out there doing incredible things in a gun stuff why we're big driving part of that commerce in America\nYou know and I'm looking at some of the chapters you have your the peace dividend you're talking about you know a modern rifles or the fault in the fall and rise of sharp shooters or with a quote from Chris Kyle\nYou got you know you really are tracking the kind of the role of firearms what's the goal why did you do this book in the first place\n[noise] well I've been you know most I write about politics and I've been very involved in the debates Second Amendment for Fifteen Years and um it's very important to me even though I live in places where it's hard to get guns or maybe because I live in those places but\nThe reason was I think that we're always arguing about the ideology and the politics guns into safety and the mass shootings in kind of those things and they're important to talk about [noise]\nBut we never talk about is why guns are certain that it in the DNA of this country and why people [noise]\nUh you know if people always ask me you know why is America so different what's with the gun culture you know wherever I go there always are nearing the gun culture well\nIt didn't just pop up and you know Nineteen Seventy seven it's been around from the beginning and I wanted people to know what that story was and why the guy who's buying a gun today shock on air fifty whatever why he is has that guy and why he cares about that gun and why he is\nA responsible with that guy and he understands maybe the history even if it doesn't know every part of it he under its he's part of a sort of cultural continue on you know\n... and and he feels he or she feels an intrinsic connection to\nAnd I don't care if it's John Wayne the mythical west or the real west or to the revolutionary war or the people who founded the country because they had their own personal firearms which is why are we really had just become a\nWhether they can voice it or not they feel like they know what they know that they are simply the latest in the continuation from two hundred and Thirty years ago\n[noise] right I mean and it might you know I Can't think of anything else off of hand right now that has that connects people stood at length Lexington people today and America is meeting as a sort of thing that they owned an ad and I'm sure there are others but it is the very un American thing\nYou know and he mentioned every what that was a personal weapon so it after the men and men were fighting the British and I would ask them to have their weapons after you know and the men I stood at Lexington and Concord\nThey were protecting a cache of weapons and powder they weren't fighting for you know income inequality or whatever I don't want to diminish other issues but they were fighting because someone was coming to take their means of defending themselves and survival away and you know historians sort of diminished that fact all the time and that was one of the reasons I Want it to write a book about it\nWell I Would recommend the book because I think when people get this when they read it they will then be able this is the value in it certainly getting the information is one guy\nBut a more material maybe more practical value is once you've read first freedom you will be able to explain to people what is the killing culture what is it with your gun people why do you like your gun so much what's the deal here and you'll be able to say\nWell look take a deep breath let me explain to you what the deal is and they won't have gotten that information from what I think is a really excellent book David congratulations\nI appreciate you saying that very much and thank you\nPerhaps man it's a baby on Amazon and other places called a first freedom a ride to America's during history with a gun thank you David appreciate that high\nSchool here eight six six talked\nGun or what is on your my one of the open lines now there's a gun you want to tell me about the rage more you'd like to deliver for if you'd like to\nJust tell me what it was like for you for your family your friends ... who is having a hearing you say

if anything happened to her and I know that really drives me crazy when I say that because you're supposed to believe all women except for all the reports we're getting now they're popping up everywhere false accusations that people find out about the defending yourself against this is close to impossible\nClose to impossible yeah yeah a ballet lessons\nAll those questions I liked her after we worked on that guy they listen to it and all the whole she found in there the questioning that she did I thought of her she was just terrible you are listening to her report\nThat she did afterwards that break down up there and all the old and a doctor for testimony I thought well you get a better job and I even touch you doing\nYeah she came out afterwards as you said you know no no prosecutor would take this case basically there's nothing here there's there's there's nothing you could take action on you can't possibly take action against this man on the basis of what we saw and heard here\nYeah yeah but like I said I was sitting out in the middle of the hill or yelling at the radio a question that I had and nobody heard me [laughter]\nWell a lot a lot of us were yelling ... let me about yourself have you uh you're in Kansas and we keep hearing that you know where women are energized by this because women are in the ... the me too movement and women are you know going to march to the polls and vote Democrat\nAnd yet I don't know maybe that is true on the coasts but where I live and I'm Wondering where you live I Can't tell you how many women have said this is horrible

Clinton they believe in Obama and they are still going to vote that they don't care about the fact that just it's almost like a mind that you can not enter trait to\nGet in any information they will

could agree with on some things Democrats I'm Talking about elected politicians now the problem is though every elected politicians you put in who's a Democrat it reinforces\nPower of the lawsuit Feinstein a Barbara you know the whole ... ball if you will of the ultra left is so that even if you say well this is a good Democrat a vote for that person is actually vote for policy and

we are I Wish we had\nA system where you could say let's just choose the right person regardless of party but that's just not the way it is and to do that devote obviously if you're a person who supports gun rights\nYou can't you\nSorry you just can't vote for a Democrat even if that person individually as okay on gun rights that person helps below sea and Feinstein by simply by being there and being a vote to beat a person on the Democrats' side and gets them control of Congress and they get to decide\nWho heads up the committee's they get to decide which laws get our bills get brought up for vote and they get to decide who is going to be confirmed for Supreme Court justice as I said every single week leading up to two thousand sixty election\nThis election was not about Hillary
