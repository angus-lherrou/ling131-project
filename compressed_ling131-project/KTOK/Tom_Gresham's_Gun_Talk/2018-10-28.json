{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "War called toll free one eight eight eight to ...\nAnd tell us a call letters some of this radio station I'm\nAudie if we turn Halloween back into what it was supposed to be originally all Hallows eve\nIn their words if the evening before all Hallows are all saints day we can even call it good people's day he rose day what if we dressed our kids up in good costumes and taught them to do good works\nKids are little hands and they love to dress up and perform are we so damn than we can't teach good lessons from that we can't take advantage of that somehow to do something worthwhile to teach them good habits take Jesus admonition that it's better to give than to receive\nNow he didn't say this is some abstract thing he he's saying that it is genuinely really and truly better to do that maybe you believe that and maybe you don't and maybe the reason you don't believe that if you don't believe it is because you haven't really given it a try\nWhy don't you consider this getting together with some of your neighbors contact the director of a nursing home somewhere nearby and arrange for your kids to go down there and put on a little show for the nursing home people\nHave them take along gifts of fruit and yeah even candy for the old folks they have are notorious for their sweet to use these old ladies and old man life in a nursing home can be pretty bleak for old people and shame fully they don't get to see their own grandchildren and great grandchildren very often\nThe kids are too busy to bring them by so they don't see those very often maybe maybe your own kids could go down there and you could go and your friends could go and let some of these old folks hug your kids since they can't hug their own grandkids\nI Know some teens who make an annual pilgrimage to put on the show in a nursing home and they go down and they sing songs and they go around and shake hands with these people in touch them and sit down and and and talk with them and they and the old folks get to cry on them together\nIn a visit means so very much you know doing good and no one you've done good really touches your heart makes you feel good these days we talk a lot about self esteem\nYou brag about self esteem either build a false sense of self esteem but you know when you really touched somebody's life and you made their life better and you see their eyes water up when you leave and there are so sorry to see you go\nThat does something very real for your self esteem it's astonishing in a way to think of how small the difference is between extorting candy from strangers\nAnd then on the other hand putting on a show for them and actually giving them something I can imagine there are people\nIn your community that would fall flat on the floor in the doorway if the kid walked up and said we've come by to give you a gift on Halloween\nYou know I remember Halloween when I was a boy it was a night of mischief\nWe never called it Sammy and I didn't know anything about saying hey I just knew Halloween but it was a night of the celebration of Sam honey nevertheless it was an eye for pretending we were demons mischievous spirit pulled your guys it was a night for slipping up windows and playing tricks on homeowners and\nOh and where I Lived in North west Arkansas all back in those days the big thing was to go turn over outdoor toilets\nThe town I Lived in around five thousand population had a sore but around the edges of town where people were a little bit poorer they lived a little bit outside of the range of the septic system or the sewer system a lot of them had outdoor toilets you know they say ruin a path instead of room in a bath\nWell best mischievous guys we'd go out during the night and we turn these things over it was great fun well at least it was great fun until the night we turned over one that had a man in at the time we turned it over\nTruth is that most of our exploits we're in our imaginations\nAnd the worst of the stories we told about Halloween and all the bad things we did never happened at all\nFact I Need to get a bunch of guys together telling stories like that they'd be hard put to know for sure whether they really did that or whether the\nStory just got bigger with a telling over the years\nNo I'll have to say that that some perverse level there was something resembling fun involved in all that but I Can't help thinking how long it took me to learn the very real fond of giving joy to others because it really is fun it makes you feel good\nI Am frankly a little annoyed at my parents and my church for winking and nodding at the mischief of Halloween for a chuckling over all this stuff at least they could have done was disapproved the most they could have done was\nTo have taught me a better way of all people the churches ought to know that and they ought to be doing it the mischief gave me no joy learning to give some pleasure to others\nMight well have given me great joy and the ... that comes from giving\nBecome addictive just like doing evil can be addictive\nYou know for several years back in the late eighties early nineties the city of Detroit was gripped with the wave of arson Halloween in Nineteen Ninety four there were a hundred and eighty fires set on what they called devils night Halloween and became an absolute epidemic of evil feeding on the evil [noise]\nWell the citizens of Detroit got together and decided to try to do something about it merchants donated radio citizens from organizations lodges took to the street in great numbers and they organized themselves to visit every nook and plenty of Detroit once every hour next year\nThe city declared victory over the devil and the number of fires was reduced to a record low and they dub did angels night\nIt's interesting they stepped across from the evil too good to have the right idea drive out evil with good change the name change the conduct stop calling at Halloween called all saints day or call it good people's day call and good actions good deeds day\nSaints are wholly people they're good people and we can teach our children to imitate the example of good people by doing good works\nI honestly believe that kids can learn that good works can be just\nAs much fun as mischief that a lot more satisfying to twelve chapter of the book of Romans Paul said this beginning averse nine Let Love be without pretense abhor that witches evil cleave to that\nWhich is good you know you you can't judge by appearances but we do know the difference between good actions an evil actions and he said we need to learn even as little children there's absolutely no reason if it's better to give than to receive the we can't learn that if children it was better for adults is better for kids\nAbhor that which is evil cleave to what's good me kindly affection one to another with brotherly love in honor of referring one in other\nDomains last fall and business ... be fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing and hope patient and tribulation continuing instilled in prayer and then he says distributing\nTo the necessity of the saints\nLooking out for good people out there in the world and considering people that are old perhaps in and can't take care of themselves and the way that they used to do and to distribute that is to give to the necessity of these people\nGiven to hospitality learn what it's like to feed some want to bring someone into your home to be kind to people\nBless them their persecute you blessed and cursed not rejoiced with them that rejoice weep with them that we learn the lessons of sympathy of empathy and of caring about other people\nDo you think children can't learn this\nRecompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest and the side of all men and there's if it's possible as much as lies within you live peaceably with all man and you don't do that by turning over his outhouse\nBelow don't avenge yourselves but give place under raff is written vengeance is but I Will repay say lord therefore if your enemy is hungry feed him if he's thirsty give us something to drink ... doing so you will sheep\nCold of fire on his head and then comes this marvelous fundamental Christian\nTeaching don't be overcome by evil overcome evil was good\nUntil next time
