I don't know Jesus said I'm going to say to some people like that I never knew why noticed that little worried\nAt the end of the sentence get away from me you that work iniquity the Greek word that we find here is talking about lawlessness\nWho people who pay no attention to my law who won't keep my words it's it's it's a complete\nYou know a gospel that has nothing to do with obedience with law it has to do with the kind of cheap grace and it's mostly involved with performance with you know a miracles are things that you can see all of that is very impressive\nBut Jesus Says that end going to cut it folks you got to do what I tell you to do and by the way\nWe're not talking here about Buddhist Muslims or something eastern religion these people claim to be working in the name of\nJesus and if you believe what Jesus said here you ought to be able to turn your TV set on Sunday Morning and make your way across the dial and somewhere along there you ought to be able to find one of these people\nI Know you don't tell you who's who you're gonna have to figure that out for yourself but really if Jesus knew what he was talking about isn't it true that we're going to have to find them somewhere they're out there I think about that I'll be right back after this short message\nFor a free ... radio program that you can share with friends and others write or call this week only men requested the program titled may treaty with the devil\nRide to mourn joy in post office bombs five six zero White House Texas Seven five seven nine one more call toll free one eight eight eight miles forty four\nAnd tell us the call letters of this radio station\nNow Jesus winds up is what he's talking about here inverse twenty four Matthew Seventeen with an illustration\nIs therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine and does them I like him to a wise man who build his house on a rock the rain descended floods came that wins blue beat on the house it didn't fall because it was built on a rock\nAnd everyone that here's these sayings of mine in doesn't do them\nIn ... in context of what he's saying here he's talking about all kinds of people who will say Jesus is lord who we'll call him lord lord and will do what he says\nHe says those people he says idol they're like a foolish man that build his house on the sand in the rain to send it in the floods came when the winds blue and beat on a house down that came and great\nWas the ... all of it now and why would anyone build his house on the sand because it's easier maybe it's cheaper is that why he would do it I Do know in my neck of the woods\nCan buy land in the hundred year floodplain a whole lot cheaper than you can get land on the high ground\nWhat he's talking about here is a person who isn't willing to pay the price to do it right\nIt's a person who cuts corners I remember I said there are three reasons why we compromise with the devil we get tired where war weary with bearing the burden and and the heat of the day and so oftentimes when somebody comes along\nAnd do that this go this way you're willing to compromise and maybe you're afraid you're afraid to God is very displeased and rather than repent and tried to do what he says do somebody tells you oh you don't have to really do that and so you'll go follow that way\nAnd we don't want to pay the cost the continuing cost of liberty\nJesus said it would not be easy to be a Christian if that's true then fatigue will be a factor sometimes we make compromises with evil because we are just tired\nThere is a prophecy in as a forty three God\nSpeaking to Israel and versus Nineteen says behold I Will do a new thing now it's going to spring for show you not know what I'm going to make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert\nThe beach to the field will honor me\nThe dragons and the ALS will honor me because I give them water in the desert and rivers by the desert to give drink to my people my chosen\nD's have I formed for myself now what he's talking about is the ousted dragons the beast these are what he's talking about the people he has people in the wilderness as it were he said I formed all these for my self they will show forth my praise I can get it from the beach the aisles the dragons and so forth\nBut you Israel have not called upon me you have been weary of me\nWater thing to have gutsy to us you know I get praise from the birds the beach to the field snakes you name it out there all these things out here they show my praise for it day by day but you you're just tired of me aren't you\nAnd I guess when he gets right down to it what are we tired of we can begin to lay down the the burden of living God's life were just tired of him pulled right into the ...\nChapter six verse one said brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault you who are spiritual restore such a one and the spirit of maintenance considering yourself list you'll be tempted to tell you something that is hard to do it's a lot easier if\nA man's gotta fall but let it go and talk to somebody else about it and not bother going to him as a burden to be born here Paul says bear one another's burden and fulfill the law of Christ this is going to cost you something to do this you know\nSome free he says if a man thinks himself to be something when he's nothing he deceived himself but every man prove his own work\nSo he can have rejoicing and himself and other what somebody else has done every man will bear his own burden whole yeah there is a burden to be born people you can't serve Christ and not at not cost you anything\nYou got to step up to the plate as it were you got to carry that burden let him at his taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things that just simple statement if somebody's teaching you the truth support him\nDon't be deceived God is not marked for whatever I'm an SOS he's going to rape and I remember that song when my dad used to sing it you report so ever use\nWhatever the seeds they will grow\nIn a man needs to be really pretty careful pulses if you sold to the flesh you're the flesh going to rip corruption if you sold to the spirit the spirit going to reap life everlasting but don't ever think it's not going to cost you something and then he says let us not be weary in well doing\nWhen do season we will reap if we just\nDon't fade you're gonna have to hang in there folks the way is not easy it's not short\nIt's long its appeal and sometimes the temptation to lay it down as more so more than almost than we can bear\nBut we can't give it up\nHe says as we therefore have opportunity let us do good to all men especially those\nWho are of the household of faith\nNo I Know you would never intentionally make a deal with the devil you never make a treaty with him but it's entirely possible folks that you and I both would compromise with what is right because we are tired the writer Hebrew said\nSince we were surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses he just didn't eleventh chapter ... told us about all these great examples of faith and he said when you got this whole crowd of witnesses around you\nLet's throw off everything that hinders in the sand that so easily entangled us and others run with perseverance the race that is marked out for us\nThat's out of the ... and I thought that was a striking way of putting it for each of us in our future there is a race that has marked out for us and we have to run that race\nUnless we are too tired unless we're ready to make a treaty with the devil so we can lay down the burden and take it easy I'm Ronald ...\nBorn to win radio program with Ronald ... sponsored by Christian educational ministries and made possible by donations from listeners like you if

X. Y. F. M. Ninety six point one agency\nLet's say [noise]\nHeating rally it's for a pair of political rivals I'm Pam who's now Fox News well accusing President Trump shredding and Eric in value is former vice president Joe Biden fired a crowd in Nevada where Democrats that chance to flip a Senate seat in next month's midterms it's time to get up let\nBefore federal federal was the first company to load partition bullets you had to be a Hanover if you're going to use now as a petition boats\nYeah yeah for sure whether it be was the first ones it yet but not many people were buying this was in the early ... there was only for what the federal first major coffee\n[noise] oh yeah yeah otherwise you had them and this was you know this was even when I think even on Bob bagel wrote this book and Seventy Seventy mostly had\nSure All right so here's a question for you or I mean the big book of gun got to it says more stuff about hand loading and hunting rifles and this is not like glamorous competition rifles this is a hunting rifle but the two have kind of\nEmerged hunting rifles are really incorporating a lot of the stuff that we have learned and advance much we picked up from the long range shooting a competition world\nExactly ... and ... and he said for even getting a bullets at our boat credibly high ballistic called Fisher um target or controlled expansion so we're getting in some ways of both worlds especially for people hunt won\nSo the question now is and this is the million dollar question is there a reason to handle it anymore\n[noise] in many ways not especially if it's one of the reasons the six point five ... ... ... you can really really accurate factory ammunition both for match on it it doesn't cost us much\nAnd I hope you are and lowdown even\n... exactly I mean I basically I have not pool to the handle on a ... for a number of years now because I just look at and go man the factory animal is so good you know yes the bones are better\nBut the other thing is six Thirty years ago if you wanted or something and it was going to shoot a half inch you had him look now there are probably a half a dozen or doesn't manufactures animal makers who will sell you buy\nCause of animal that what you have ...\nOh yeah and often factory rifles really inexpensive factory\nRight mhm it spreads it kind of queasy Trumbull yeah yeah it's very different the world that we grew up in about eight or ... asked\nAll right so as we look at the world now that we're in one of the big changes and I was going to get you to talk about this Mac some years ago if you weren't a flat shooting rifle you just went with more and more velocity 'cause that was and so we were we were all about building a magnitude ... big you know allowed and ... and all of that\nAre not necessary anymore is it\n[noise] no no it's not necessary anymore I Do a lot of a lot of authors still believe it should be here long range they think of high velocity\nWhen the high BC bullets uh you don't need it does it you may not even that the new cartridges may not shoot quite as far as the old the hype last archery but because we range fighters we can compensate for the range sites\nAnd I will yes well\nActually the truth there is no the reason we wanted flat shooting carts just was because we were guessing at the range\nIs that we didn't know what the range was we were using all sorts of things like estimating football fields here to the nearest town on an album\nAnd write or two lines in a scope and you were supposed to be on the back in the belly of a critter and hope that the standard size critter\nAnd your ... good luck with that that's kind of money to hundred yard now to\nShed that people that got a football field but it it still wasn't as precise as a laser\n... exactly so now you've got a six point five that shoots flat enough hits hard enough and the real key is can you put it on targets of what's happened to help us put bullets on target\n[noise] well one of the biggest advantage of pie ballistic goldfish and boss is not so much they shoot flatter but they retain more energy which helps a little bit but the the trips less than ...\n... and so ... saying we still have to get to make to a certain extent you survived the electronic ... your pocket but\nA ... you can't get a precise idea of wind like you can write\nWell yeah you know we knew that\nUntil we can get our when doping drone that we send down range\n[laughter] cannot know\nTold my gosh you gotta know somebody is doing that right now right\n[noise] where most of these really looked at a place but yeah but I think that you had a\nBig advantage of even these moderate philosophy a Partridge just like the ... if ... if you make a little error they in the window estimation they kind of make they prevent you from screwing up too much\n[noise] All right let's just a practical uh example if you had a condition where I bought from Thirty years ago would drift ten inches to this one side the guy who's going to drift in it just and you use a high BC bullet up today and it's going to drift five inches\nA basically one can miss or wounded critter and the other one gets to the hit that you know now you're just sharpening knife\nYet here's your landing the bullet viable ... even even a like a small error prone envelope as by Larry side of a falling out eating\nExactly\nBullet in that age ... much easier with hype issue\n[noise] okay are we we kinda talked around this thing we said yeah maybe you know a lot of people don't need him load but why would you handle wide well more specifically why do you handle it and what do you do with your stuff when your hand learning\n[laughter] [noise] well I handle part of his job but I also still really enjoy it uh at the end stumped still it's the only way to use some of the new bullets ah because they don't come in a factory\nRight like for instance right now I'm working with well there actually is a factory I've been working recently with the ... on five PR sheet which is a slightly bigger\nRight but it's a brand new and it's there's not that many loads available is you know you get hornets of course\nYeah yeah and it will become more popular I'm sure that\nI had to do I have to do a hallowed harp on it and I and I had a gun I had a gun ... barrels at it and I wanted to use various so that was one reason I hand load and I also found some really accurate combination so was I got there the hearty ammo it's fantastic yeah\nBut I eat it a little by little bit my hand left up whether this makes any difference when you shoot some size football I don't know uh but\nIt can give you bragging rights when you're shooting with your buddy and I guess that would be the other thing hand loading still allows you to find junior load to that specific rifle and get the very best out of it\nYeah and and yet when your index it with what you're sitting around talking ... buddies and you've got some very\nThat's why I said well he's forty grains of a four sixty four and that you're there but not really a good\nYeah okay that's the kind of stuff we do I mean it it's not easy but it's kind of stuff we do the book is called the the big book of gun gas to which means of course if you don't have number one that you're going to get that one is well a ban on that as it is your website the best place
