instead of earning low wages given an extremely low levels\nThe charitable working poor tend to be far more politically conservative than the non working poor are\nBeginning to understand I think we're a compassionate conservativism comes from the idea of\nFourth charitable giving his learn reinforced in practice within intact families especially religious families secularism and family breakdown are far less prevalent among conservatives and liberals fifth\nEuropeans are far less personally charitable than people needed in the United states Europeans are also on average far into the political left of Americans\nThe net result of these five facts is that conservative generally behave more charitable a than liberals especially with respect to money donations\nSo if you're a Christian what does your world view say about all this after all we think we are supposed to give\nNot wait for the government to come and take it away from us\n[noise] you know according to one source social justice refers to a concept of a just society where justice refers to more than just the administration of law as it is based on the idea of a society which gives individuals and groups fair treatment and age just share\nOf the benefits of society\nNow there is no explanation here about what constitutes a just share of the benefits of society the whole idea of communism was from each according to his ability to each according to his needs and we all know what happened to Marxism it has collapsed spectacularly in our own generation\nFrom the same source which by the way is the online encyclopedia wicked the\nSocialism refers to a broader ray of doctrines or political movements that envision a socio economic system in which property and the distribution of wealth are subject to control by the community\nThis control may be direct exercise through popular collective such as workers councils or indirect exercise on behalf of the people by the state as an economic systems socialism is often characterized by state or worker ownership of the means of production\nNow it isn't take take very long to see what's wrong with this from a Christian worldview in the first place the Christian faith is drawn in support of the week\nIs that liberal is that conservative is it socialistic stay with me through this short break when I come back I'll explain\nMore free CD of this

Jesus where he looks ahead into the future to the time of his coming in his glory with all the angels and sitting on his thrown in heavenly glory\nAll the nations are gathered before him and he separates the people from one another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats this isn't Matthew twenty five per se thirty three he pushed the sheep on the right to go on the left him and he speaks to those on his right hand the sheep\nThen the king will say to them come you who are blessed to my father take your Inheritance The kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world oh wow this wonderful this is when we actually get to see Jesus it's when we come into his presence when we inherit the kingdom of God what did we have to do\nTo get that well\nThere are those who say nothing at all in their ... right up to a point but then Jesus goes on to say this for which means it's because of this I was hungry and you gave me something to eat I was thirsty you gave me something to drink I\nWas a stranger and you invited me in I needed close\nClose to me I was sick and you looked after me I was in prison and you came to me\nAnd the righteous will say lord ah when did we see you hungry and feed you I don't remember doing any of these things you're talking about and the king reply I tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me\nSo why is this not socialism because he addressed as many of the concerns of socialism a feeding the hungry and clothing that I could\nJust not socialism because it's personal not governmental why should we be blessed for ... for paying our taxes\nTaxes are taken from us they are not given to somebody to help\nAnd whenever you actually give close to somebody who is doesn't have warm clothes to wear in the winter time that's a personal thing you do that and you have the option of not doing it therefore what Christ is describing is not socialism\nIs personal compassion you gain no cache from Christ by being taxed by having money taken from you and given to the poor and the ideal world of the Bible there were no Texas but wait wait\nWasn't their ties oh sure there was a time but the ties was voluntary\nBut wait wait wasn't the title law yes it was but the only enforcers of that law weren't God in nature\nThere was no Internal Revenue service to collect the ties you could choose not to ties and leave God's blessings off of your economic life\nMarvelous statement in ... the third chapter about this about what no why is all this stuff going wrong in your life why is it that you know you're you're showing all these crops are doing all that stuff you don't have enough to eat\n... stealing from me God said you know every Christian voluntarily personally enters covenant with Jesus Christ our fellowship even with one another which we call the church depends first on covenant with Christ [noise]\nNo it isn't clear to me why a disciple of Jesus would want to omit any portion of his life from that covenant ... family be career be economic investments money you name it\nShe's just said if you love me keep my commandments so if you don't love him don't bother\nThere is no gain from grudging obedience there is no gain to you from co worst obedience you may know points with Jesus Christ by paying your taxes so the government can help the poor\nYou know Otis the Old Testament law had many obligations to the poor but everything was voluntary for example of it of course the twenty third chapter he says when you reap the harvest of your land you shall not make a clean residents of the corners of your field when you read\nYour not together in a gleaming of the harvest you leave them to the poor into the stranger him billboard you're God so if you were poor or if you were a soldier coming through and you're out of money and had nothing to eat you could actually go out into a man's field\nAnd collect green from the corners of the leanings of the field they were yours to take\nBut there was no obligation to carry it to the poor they had to come and get it I think Christian socialism is an oxymoron for every sacrifice made by Christian must be voluntary not coerced\nMy world view what's yours and you\nPost office box five zeros\nSeven five seven nine\nIn the usa and Canada called toll free\nEight eight eight Bible forty\nAnd visit our

feedback you know and\nYou know that this is a counter the premise of it and\nNot to mention other attributes just making the training convenient and do a lot of things we can't do on a range and and of course I felt federally didn't build that for them after they build it for myself at just\nUnder half I wasn't going to ask you how did this come about in the first place\n[noise] you know it's it's a good question I mean they don't take a step back a second I Know but what college football and like competitive Venus and such and those are the formative years of life and everything and got misled and was life badly and turn went to law school and a lawyer\nDuring the Clinton years you but you can recover from that right on recovering I Am recovering seven years and retired [laughter]\nUm you know the ... of course John journalism and and see what that was about but the moral or are they competitive shooter just love shooting 'em all discipline them one of those where do the bulls I started out those who have like a feat steel and us PSA I'm\nStill shooting ... didn't have in our area you know honestly but anyways\nUh you know and I just looked at it like sports respective I was never first response would have been fascinated with your military and for spawn are looking at the corruption but I've never never never done that just just by way of uh\nYou know football in law school that stuff so but I just love shooting always loved gun very passionate but I guess I looked at it from for science perspective hey look you know I'm looking at the skill set of running around celebrating shooting beaten accuracy just\nLook at some guy like Nick liquor during a later age like this is this something like you know new golfer racket ball and this is the real deal you know I just couldn't believe I never was exposed to it\nOr you know they've got to make in the short answer long and short or long but you know I decided to build my own tool for high volume felt right now if you're training and ironically nothing on the market was an Air America\nHas its place but you know the green got\nRan out yeah this is so different now I'm looking here on the website and it's the next level training dot com you this comes in a glock in in Smith Wesson ... pi clones if you will\nYou know these these are not you know these are not cheap these are actual tool is and I know a number of serious trainers who all have certain pistols and they use them for for training but also for practice give us an example of who uses it no I wanted to do with us or pistol\nYeah you bet it several different markets were put up like that between you know instructor and we see in her instructors but generally open enrollment instructors law enforcement of course I'm you know and and within ... years really here is if you want to just just get get wrapped practical rep for the classroom\nUm where a lot of them and ... as far and just intertwined safety with the ... the\nI mean yeah we can talk for control and grip group establishment to fight all I'm a lot of drills but who when you get the big in the hands you really see muscle awareness trigger finger discipline and I've never had a class for the correct someone on that somewhere along the way you know um but then from there I mean our ideal is really that high volume training like this\nLike I have several search around the house I just pick it up and get wrap on\n... so you got the trains side it's hardcore training and then more of a lifestyle\nOf training where you can't really keep you're like well you can't keep her life are flying around so to speak you know you're right but Serpas if I were there and like fit a functional features of life are tools and so it's yeah it it\nDo you have ports are are are you know testimonials about how this helps and how you could benefit from a certain coastal\nActually we're looking at full study right now I'm sure you and I'll be like on an actual like like the word you know a control group study I was just down there this summer I'm a doctor show in on that on request of uh of one of the um my whether you wanted it and I don't know quite what an agency\nSo anyway um but I mean the actual yeah I mean get you a question that litany of anecdotes a particularly than officer doesn't pass calls like this are they trained for the weekend that they have trained they got to have their front created a grip establishment\nRight you've got to know what you do need but didn't yeah yeah\nYeah exactly it's like Gina basketball you gotta have balance elbow I'd fault you know I mailed out right away\nIn a bad mechanics but um and then they come back and back strongly strongly their their qualifications and and I don't just want to call me that's like passing freshman English ... I mean that's like that's just a one on one thing right I mean\nI there but then there's something I Want to throw in your bike and I think it may be the part that you had mentioned that to me is the most important of the reason to get a search coastal\nYeah that is the safety aspect\nI cannot tell you and you know the stories\nHow many negligent discharges have been made which is so called unloaded guns and people are products and shooting ...
