requests for Dave than any other guest that I experience since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises become Dave great to have you back\nGeorge I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nWhen you say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into some of them really seem to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities\nOr some of the missing to your own life right\n[noise] you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family are people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put in the book just recently ...\nProbably because it's it's more of an evolution in my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know have these people are really really good people these are the drags fighting these are the upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it\nIt seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh\nI kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA runner and out of resources we've got stopped well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report\nThe who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search\nOr the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching wind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything I find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but ah it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd a sort of how it all started and I filed a series of the freedom of Information Act of course the confessional Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police

during the break there that uh you've got some imitators out there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that for a moment before we jump into the cases\n[noise] this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the named David flight is missing for one one missing in national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a cannon missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know if somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us the people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a less effect can't and missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use euro in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate and the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that\nPerson has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased they're released the report most times times they want there's a case from eighty six\nAnd are filmed impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often sound impossible distances away and there is no way no way they can walk there on their own or talk about that than I Am\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track but that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated that\nThere's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen all these numbers absolutely blown without to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search thirty miles away\nFor a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail\nWalk away we'll watch the child would set child's gonna do for the next hour they said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe they'll play in the dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit\nGet upset cry and then go to sleep and I said how many how many parents and your that your kid would run up hill nobody raised around I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise] but I have all these examples where the heights been achieved by these little ...\nWhere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nA you know it got to move we talked about a two year old boy that they traveled nine to twelve miles\nIn nine hours over two mountain ranges anywhere from ... you know the next morning unbelievably of why we found that got years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and this is Martha couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne belly bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on the bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours to have to go watch six miles per hour\nBut kids are going to war for twenty four hours with no food or water\nUm it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and blocked him there\nAnd and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child who's abducted in downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know church often we put them in the car and drove from there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody sonic cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make a difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one that happened in organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona\nReady to take a break now

cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nOn February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around and she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant

still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles and all the reports said that they stay that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and then you as university lab tech to earn some extra money [noise]\nShe loved the outdoors hike regularly on January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and was smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling\nAnd found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February third please contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nYou know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on for ... second he notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that sending to Forman teams up that trail the search\nWhether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they determined care was laughing eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base\nThey brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent a guy named Matt Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that at the care would never ever go off trail she was in al ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second Matt Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seven one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service put a team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils and it was three type written pages that outlines a search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for radio what it says one additional was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the hosts a J. O. S.\nA very strong in distinct human odor was found but no other locations\nSupervising ranger how cross of ... through our national monument and one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of the body had very strong and positive feelings on the day than a vacation to the odor\nThe following day ranger costs after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the odor was observed at the same location but only occasionally and noticed this\nAnd other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary all efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never and thousands of reports seen anything described in our national park service report as very weird and scary\nFlight that yeah\nThat's really strange is just dealing day had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is digging human flesh but there is no source or the older\nWell here's what's as other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary so\nI'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be rewritten scary\nBut ah\nWas her second hike into that area wishing nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note or where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty days search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's no\nThere's nothing left of her family anymore\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's editor for what looks like great things his name is Steven read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon told me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know\nI'm going to go against my own protocol I'm going to call the parents and I'm Glad I did but Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety nine salmon Butte trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon\nAbout seven miles southwest of Mount Hood and for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount ... around Mount Hood that I've written about before he was twenty four years old\nStreaming edition and I heart radio [noise]\nAnd now the heart radio weaken sports time capsules sports fans Sandy West\nMessages that are reflecting the rules a return text messages listened to Nick and Vicki story about seek quiet\nDuring when the very loud and ... very draining to be next to somebody who you're trying to sleep and we've got that lounge reverberations\nYou're always hoping she'd get to sleep before I come\nHere to take you back on the journey to this week in sports history that's our way back in Nineteen oh three were the first World Series begins play\nBoston Americans eat the Pittsburgh Pirates five games to three and a best to nine series this week in Nineteen thirty two it was Babe Ruth legendary call three points to center field before ... into the Wrigley Field bleachers in the fifth inning was game three of the world\nBecause I started getting the point where I was concerned because I knew she wasn't going to get much rest if I came to ban the same time you know she's been so used to me by 'em all the world\nSeries and the Yankees won seven to five this week in Nineteen fifty one third baseman Tommy Thompson hits a one house three run home run and the bottom of the ninth inning to win the national\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow is the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you a loan them you write for\nCall today and let me get started\nIn it for the New York giants Thompson's homerun wrapped up in amazing come from behind run to the giants the giants went on to lose the series to the Yankees but Tom says miraculous home run remains one of the\nNation they raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age list male Macs a patent pending formula within a greeting if that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases muscles sauce and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric\nOxide memorable moments in sports history referred to as the shot heard round the world\nThis week in Nineteen eighty Larry Holmes retains his W.

cases so I Want to jump into one of the most baffling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McCain and this is really pretty creepy\n[noise] that is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota it's a community just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old [noise]\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called mounds view again just north of Minneapolis north side this Koester area of missing

disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that\nAnd then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now in the Nevada try and go down there by you\nIt goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought you know this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I\nPut it on a map\nI said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go\nTo Sam in national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence [noise] so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and king canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about in Nevada try and go there's several thousand planes that crashed in disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents\nThings which seems reasonable but when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... where you wanted to get into or should we just go you jump into the cases of air disappearances in general\nIt was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the book from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a I grew up not far from Marshfield in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week\nAnd it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise]\nOn August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair there was a man by the Senate earners Cody twenty seven years old and Ensign Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the feral on islands and Cody was at the controls of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a needed for patrol\n[noise] we'll both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the feral on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck and the navy scrambled to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWill the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling a five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was their\nMinute eleven Fifteen Fort function calls Moffett Field again stating that that in LA had crashed\nIn the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one throw was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were life preserver over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each\nA airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel was in the tanks the radio was in perfect condition no distress call for fun and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy built in a postcard shipped to solve the blimp dip and drop to flares on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds they said all appear fairly normal but it did go into the cause and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nThere was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there's a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're in the jump into the other details about this case and then ... your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nInto the break with the journey wheel in the sky\nTo find them ... and I just log on to go to ... am done\n\n\n\n\nShe can we\nSay they're rock and roll lovers ... this week in rock and roll history start off in Nineteen Seventy eight where the members of Aerosmith bells dirty bans in jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne coliseum something and then\nThis week in Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather was attacked by a man who hit them from behind and repeat freeze can is what is the frequency hunting are in to write this song\nWhat's the frequency Kenneth this week in Nineteen eighty seven in a while twists Smokey Robinson holes in the number ... hot one hundred with one heartbeat slow song about him\nWhen smoky things like ABC\nIsn't embrace this week in Nineteen Ninety two she NATO Connor written up a\nPhoto of Pope John Paul the second on Saturday Night live protest over sexual abuse and the Roman Catholic Church the incident happened as she needs engineer live performance in out of nowhere produced a photograph of Pope John Paul second which he didn't rich and the beaches there were done silence in the Saturday Night live studio and NBC\nDid they went to commercials and this week in the year two thousand new ...

Greece's\nMuscles sauce and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide confirmed\n\n\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] for the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood there was a massive search off the coast that went on for days\nAnd they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water\nThere were lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because Jeff north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which had several strange disappearances I've documented and Jeff south\nThe Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of that point raise area\nAnd nothing immediately half half moon bay so it's one area that has just strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said they they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened\n... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left of the craft or and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\n[noise] or even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get in that case I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nIs going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened and he went to base in at the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken is if they'd been dropped from this guy several of your cases I thought the same thing\nMultiple missing for a woman bucks it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground and then some of them are dropped back into these uh locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point at one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin walk around and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot um cannot make public\nBut they uh they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and uh\nUm and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside he had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... is that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch and I asked a couple of questions it didn't\nSeem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so you know he he has a\nVery broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody who's been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call I think so um\nSo ... you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to a disappearance that I could sing my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but as I said before sometimes I think\nI related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers aren't ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood\nBecause they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water\nAnd I have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow um it's a manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation they use a control lead property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at the lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and uh\nSo you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's\nBanished like that and I have to say no other than animals livestock things that's or but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up your books and and\nYour subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I I think I'm an eye open up the phone lines you know people are going to
