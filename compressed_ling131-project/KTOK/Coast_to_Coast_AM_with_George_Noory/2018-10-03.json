[laughter] I don't do that but anyway ah he asked me what I thought was going to be\nThe the final blow of it\nAnd I hate it wouldn't get put on the spot like this because you know I'll say something and immediately apply Lewis said there's\nAt least so full of crap you know I I you know sure you know you can make prognostications improper season you can predict stuff and the weatherman does it every day but no one says he's a liar you know and ... and if he messes up no one says he's a liar well it's like what I Do is kind of like being a weatherman\n\nI feel around in a in a look around and I see what the atmosphere is and I'm Wondering what's going on and\nAnd ah\nSo I made my determinations or Jones a PIN me and he said hey so tell me what this final blows give me what do you think it is that I said it's going to be a biological attack on the United states\nMeals I agree I agree he's has um and uh I think I'm going on his show again soon probably this will be a good follow up for that yelling and talking about this ah\nBut yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states and speculate on many different occasions that this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... acts in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo they're they're preparing for some biological attack some\nContamination some toxic release um I talked to her again and function exercise is something that most people don't know about it and bring it to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do a test run they they take a lesson Maryland form of something and they released into the public\nIs test to see you know how people react to it sometimes they provide them with the antidote sometimes they see how many people checking the hospital how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for\nA the CDC and others to to to monitor the moving the disease and some people do support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently this new t._v. show\nAbout doctors called New Amsterdam are\nBarely that was a ... that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that\nIt deals with a guy who ah gets Bola Andy brings into the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow play we talked about you know the situation that happened ah with the uh Emirates plane for other planes where uh you know there was a different diseases monkey pox and uh gosh all kinds of things\nAre happening and ah it's all happening at once and they said this is a is is again of these again are forced exercise\nAnd ah\nI said you know something is going to happen where are the real thing is going to go down and when it does\nYou know we'll know that this the beginning this is the beginning of the final blow them\nAnd so I actually well and it could have been ... through the camp trails that could be you know given through mosquitoes and so today I read that the Pentagon reporter the envelopes containing biological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon\nOr the office of the president and senator Senator Ted Cruz's campaign office\nSo two packages containing rice and\nWhere is intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon\nAnd the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in and out and so they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there is at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation into the packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James ... there was an address to James Mattis achiever of naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president said Cruz's office the FBI released this statement\nThis is a statement from the ... on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious and below ups that had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility\nIs envelopes are currently undergoing further testing if this is ongoing will have no further comment on this\nShow has Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail it was addressed the Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open to contain white powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that uh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological a poison rice and\nAnd this reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact\nAh one of the other ways that they can change\nThe direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA veto biological markers that would do it actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected have you inhale it it's a you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die\nIf you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now it's so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four the Russian each called here in Oregon\nTried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nA in Dallas, Oregon and uh\nThink here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way to um distract us from it\nAh there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time is that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday\nThey'll hand down their decision and the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to the FBI doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and cabinet can be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger\nWith a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice\nAnd so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that test than emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything just peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predicted on ours Jonah show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people with this program know\nLived on this people who listen this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact numbers I remember we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger step down\nAnd we said oh you know he would probably lead retired die within three months he left the ... he left the papacy the one of my friends is really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard that we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from ...\nAnd there are several other times and then this is where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for the students out but we're not always right before damn close believe it or not we're damn close and so we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if\nThis gets out of hand [noise] they'd be prepared because if the word goes down tomorrow back cabin off some people aren't pleased we can see some more civil unrest in some of the major cities across the country [noise] so we have to prepare for that not that it will happen\nOr prepare if it does happen

talking about candidate on foreign [laughter] yeah but you know what it could all end tomorrow\nAnd you won't know what the decision will be and the people freak out those who are all you know invested in this those who are like harassing people like Mitch McConnell and others those are invested in this we need to be careful because you know anything can happen at this point\nIn with rice and being a delivered to you know the Pentagon some addressed to the president I don't understand why\nThis was not being investigated and and uh people aren't wondering if this was an attempt to assassinate the president\nFor in a in a more broader sense that'd be competition exercise because if they could send to all of the uh the people involved with the cabinet for case you know packages of rice in ... they could have killed at every single one of them are made them thinking up or too sick to vote and they said before\nA this is something that the Russian each called did back in Nineteen eighty four and this would be considered probably the second a biological attack a that would be a domestic terrorist attack to actually for a vote or decision\nTripoli six Seventy three

with you but this is the second best okay great [laughter]\nBut uh no ... yeah I have a couple of different thoughts um I Do I like how you uh you know you always see these patterns and it is interesting we're right before that that called the more that that takes tomorrow [noise]\nUm the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is you know is it possible that it is possible but it's possible that this could also be a distraction or I use that word by word but\nCould it be that actually the right side the right way and so to speak\nYeah could be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever and then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that they're targeting a course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right and then you have\nTed Cruz which if you Peru's Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to have Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the U.S while it anymore and the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of a a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know forgetting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was it was also targeted\nSure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations law but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do it for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was just work the investigation and devote a confirmation vote\nI think that it would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI's already made the decision and and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me that said well\nThey're going to wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday they said well that week's time they don't have to wait all they have to do is go back over should

the announcement the rice and was in the package is one of the of course\nSend to the president United States but what I find interesting is no reporting of is another major networks none in fact that they're focusing again on the ah there was again a cabin on board in fact right now they're talking about the protesters I just talked about confronting\nOf course Mitch McConnell and others of course getting in the faces I mean like they do it's like they're not getting in the faces of the senators\nAnd basically blaming them and saying that the Republican Party is the party of rape it and and this is this is amazingly out of line in my opinion\nYeah it's totally out of line\nSo I mean who knows who knows who's responsible for this rice it and who knows what the motive is\nBut it just all sounds like it like I said the Nineteen eighty four tempted to warning a boat or changes says you're not a vote by the Russian each called in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four it's the same ammo\nIf the same purpose to somehow stall or otherwise uh for the efforts of either the FBI investigation or the voting for senator cabinet\nYeah\nSo you got the timing of everything and I like I said there would be a biological attack there has been now we have this cat's do we have to deal with with the phones tomorrow to Eighteen eastern time I'd be fascinated to see if there's any other timing that goes

you didn't hear about it\nFor the best they all have on your levy yeah I mean she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right\nAnd uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item until the the towers went down and then that everyone was like by after that\nYou know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nI'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for [laughter]\nWell I I yeah I got but Gary wasn't planning on a or B being achieved justice [laughter] which I mean once again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's that that that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case\nWith Gary Condit that is if they were able to look through the dust clouds of the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I got out there and she gets another car good\nVery good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think a class here that you've been I Love you too man skilled at TJ in

yeah it does have an eerie quality to it in\n... you want if you want to get technical when was the brown broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what was that September eleventh\nAll right yeah I Would say just one thing but I was calling about the rice said and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from\nSomeone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to them Adderall in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination

I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a value wait a certain times and certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but I doubt metro call has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a matter

us a good story and give us your phone number Halloween story at coast to coast am dot com Halloween story coast to coast am dot com and what kind of you\nWhat do you want from people just all we need is the story in their phone number simple as that you get back at them and you generally like last year how many how many emails store you got on the year\nLike a percentage you're saying yeah yeah\nI mean so if you get a thousand emails you get like twenty of them will we get on the show between calls and emails we usually get about four email stories on in our goes to goes will be a fool three

I. dot com call now\nWhat station a mind listening to right now news radio when sounds and K T o K\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title first of all\n... this is a book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase years over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations and occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nOr and they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is on the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker\nIn the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have a big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about the city's not want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional a nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nUh some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess\nAnd now they are all modern landfills and in Europe in the U. S. are lined with a with a a water\nBarrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nSix major air pollutants your old down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe or the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution and really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in a worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nHim a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted no I've\nNever had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate\nUm and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of which cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather and our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles and the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter

than a hundred and Ninety or leaders of signed up to this most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol in Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today and they mentioned it all the nations of signed up to the Paris accords even even the the President Trump has said he's going to withdraw\nIt is kind of a universal\nThing um but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their to their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you\nAnd you are a half to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up to the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual climate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount and\nA year and has that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with the United states cutting its commitment uh they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWhich is the scandal among some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the ease the climate gate was called the University of East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOr they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker\nAnd these emails showed some very bad behavior\nUh there were a uh guys that are or were saying I'm\nA don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act other people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk Keating a data are there were people trying to you know interview or to influence the peer review process I'm\nJust I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is my interpretation is that that the scientists to these things and by the way this was a this was the primary I mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nOf they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now Eric truck driving in Indiana hello Eric\nDon't charge or is there the macho guy how's everybody doing the you're\nJust scared the heck out of my guess\nIraq to hey buddy a many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy Whitley Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with\nYellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their job to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean currents\nOr which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific the the theory basically\nWas that are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nWasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nThere was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay it's actual thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll egg and they'll make you\nStill doing its thing whoa okay go ahead John\n... my dad who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking about\nWind bills when I\nWhen I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind meals that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat\nAnd there was plenty more boy blue flame\nYou know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas while we're asking now why don't you put a generator on\nThat and we'll do ... you know electricity now come back and they said no no no and it's going to cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be born in a methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext on let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having stepmom You're welcome to spoken to him several times I heard him on\nMany shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are\nAre are using a bag lady I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to two point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just dumb old they are two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may then huh\nA ... a a young child then I'm\nHere's the point is you've already said they're more willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo watch frosty has told us is that your section thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people's daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive rally improve their

rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big uh port\nOn in in the northwest Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what the what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I I I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumped what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThese are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky is the no doubt this a lot of resemble\nHarp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite max that we used to the max\nYears ago we're seeing animated cartoon but\nThere is a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they\nCan steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast under head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex which have in our with our weather\n... when I hear about it in the new\nLuskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across a and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go man just did it exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe\nThat Adam is being gay oh engineered the chem trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the body now son well people are so much more\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's to the point now where you can go to the street and bet on\nThe stock market on the weather it didn't want her again that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't may never come up with man is not smart

a religion and spirituality and also a believer that there's a creature out there we all ...\nNo not at all to me um as as far as a big foot goes as far as you of phones go as far as angels go you can pick the topic um I Believe all of these things for me for the both of my faith\nYou look at the universe is just a vast and wanting to research thing and ah even our own planet continues to amazing baffle us with the discovery is being made day in and day out and if you just think about something like the dinosaurs for a moment\nOr if it wasn't for one guy who is out there looking around and places where you are normal person does not seeing a bone hanging out of the hillside\nWe wouldn't really know about them but we know from even books like Michael ... book forbid knock allergy\nThere have been a\nPeople of civilizations or animal life here will be for us and yet when given the account biblical eve from Adam and Eve on wood so to me it's a test of the uh what do you believe what I've given you from this point forward in spite of knowing what we're going to discover after the fact\nSpeaking of books I got from you too volumes of books on amazing but I was afraid that you sent me you're originals\nWell here's what happened in Georgia in this kind of humor is um when you produce that had contacted me uh I had an order and four foot they're actually made to order on Amazon and I had given all of\nThe copies out I had and I had what I mean I I had it in order in fruit punch bowl [laughter] and I said I have nothing to send George [laughter]\nSo I said I could make up

hear it could be an extraterrestrial it could be physical creature you could be an ape it could be dimensional we hear all kinds of things what do you think\n[noise] well [noise] ah my my own personal theories are on that or to fold\nA number one in the physical realm this is a creation this is a creature that out there uh how many of them all day yeah we don't know nobody knows\nBut based on the fact that they leave print from both hands and feet a according to some testimonies\nThey bleed having been shot a and they die as well and getting into a little later on a which to me makes them a living breathing entity like any other creature a B the greater small on the planet\nA I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart any way that they do exist and that people have every walk of life or in countering them\nUh having said that uh we\nWill get into a little story later that out of hand picked for the coast audience\nA and I have a couple of them are that do involve a UFO phenomena and my take on that is that there may be some mimicking going on here of the natural\nOkay the UFO suits so I think\nI think there's two I think one is almost like an imposter and one is the real deal\nHas anybody reportedly ever been hurt by one of these creatures\nPhysically hurt\nWell or not to my knowledge I don't have I have people\nHave been a scared out of their wits I have people that had been rushed by these things are but not attacked\nI'm you know things of this nature they um they seem to be creatures of habit\nA I Will say this getting back to human no non human dimensional on non dimensional or you hear again and again uh and it's not just me but many people are have heard from individuals that when they saw this thing\nBasically was grinning at me a a like a demon\nIn other words some people have sightings and they say you know well\nUh it had a blank face a I couldn't see it's the [noise]\nUh it had no lips and other people describe it as having this evil grim miss\nAnd

in a canoe when a\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and think keep to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd went to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later\nHe sees some ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved down to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a just been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n... yeah for the most part are people backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story a involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business\nUh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined and you know\nPercent of it is uninhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern ...\nThe main uh the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of using the gardening cool the wife is saying the husband was to shovel wisdom rate was there so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hand spades\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools\nAnd they started they left to hand spades\nOn what she called the ... the wife pulled the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for partying plants\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hands spades withdrawn they had actually called the police report depth on the property of tools and this and that\nNumber could understand who would come on their land and the tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou gonna run the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright ... and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods\nThey found one of the shovels leaning on the tree and the wife spoke out nine feet off the ground one of these one hand garden trial with a rubber handle on it\nShoved into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up show they went back to doubt they got a I guess an iPhone something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush just staying it was buried under a tree several inches thick couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shoveling the ... everybody was baffled by you know this turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was the cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives [noise]\nWell\nI said the long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside and the guardian behind the house had been trampled down there were huge footprint in the bed or tomatoes were taking the head of lettuce one mashed\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nI stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just skipped right over the warrior\nWent and had it's full of feed and then left they recall the uh the police over to see what had happened that transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big tall creatures coming in their property of walking now so it\nIsn't convincing yeah it's not like it's\nNot like these things on being seen it's not being talked about which\nIs a very odd thing you don't you don't

the abominable snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time nickel\nAnd they formed this unlikely friendship and turn that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd it did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought it looked clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nOr they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a Sanders since book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a\nAnd yet getting back to what I said earlier\nOf this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax\nThe film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taking everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know uh uh we all tune in because we're hearing things that we can get\nAnother ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nUFOs in big encounters where's the giant\nWell I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident but one day they'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being have so they were spending their time in an open area spelling out the words held than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green\nA green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating around in the dark\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the sides of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area or at night for the ICC\nWell when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one or the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in or around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nSo that the parents and the it was that bright\nYeah I mean it it it's a glowing orb of light show darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's still something really weird [noise]\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he described egg law ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow bubbles through want and\nAs a jar okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground\nAnd what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times are thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in this secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation
