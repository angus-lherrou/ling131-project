I have to talk to you off the ledge at some point tonight we have to talk about why there will eventually be a west side school to win a championship now it won't be an answer addict say insects in ... say I honestly believe that it's gonna happen I Believe that there are two schools out there\nMaybe three that that should give you hope if you're a west side fan but\nJoe you and I you been doing high school for a long time I've been doing sports for a long time seems a very strange things happen most of all your royals winning the world series a couple of years back\nSo I Know that you do something long enough eventually the law of averages wind does catch up now that I saw the west side eventually wins one is when those law of averages catches up and you just have a team get hot and run through the playoffs and\nDare I say a fluke ... state championship game I just\nDon't see it listen I covered the last west side state champion that was Midwest City we put them in the north of Nineteen Ninety five you know what I was doing that to Ninety five Mr ... still going to high school I was a freshman at the University of central Oklahoma I Am not a freshman anymore I've put out a freshmen a bunch of pounds\nYou know [laughter] I don't think the president Fifteen I've been out of more than fifty when you do that every\nYear is that the freshmen heading right now that might do it and I've been putting on the freshman Fifteen now for a good\nSo when I was just blow up the format since Mr renters already bloated up for us but I don't know this is a fall break a fight and you know\nWhat I think what we're talking about before the show is I I understand what you're saying you can see where things but we're not seen in six eight one and fixate too since they split\nUm of course the six eight to ... you know for this um some would say they split it so there'd be a west side winter I'm In one of six safe and there is not been one and there's only been three teams that are played in the state title game northern north in Latin twice in six say\nTo your your your best hopes if you want to see that kind of run here's here's a couple of things have to have a one year you're ... you are not sort of you are relying on you can and must thing the each day each day one school districts right and\nThey said they which I think they've said may unofficially that they will\nOkay so those schools have to continue to get better those populations have to continue to grow\nFamilies need to move into those areas the other thing that may play into the west sides hands is that I don't know how much genes and union NBA\nAnd ... really expand is towns and what may happen first I think you'll see it in jeans before any place else is that you've got a lot of people living in that area of the state they don't want to move\nBut they're not having kids their houses are still there\nYou know that there are still living there they're just not having more air saying when they get a sixty in six years old here in the forty years or whatever that that's see I'd like to think if I'd like to think it's forty years ... fortunately it's probably not that long I'm On Eric side in this\nI hate I hate about something flew gathering and I was going\nTo do list that I really I'm not going to you that at some point the aliens from alphabet are a good come down and kidnapped the football teams from jinx union Broken Arrow law so and then\nI don't I don't see it happening because folks are going to use those districts are going to choose to move those districts and you can be a real and I don't believe this you can choose to say there's video that you know there's a lot of Tom Foolery out there I mean you you know what not people are going to choose to go there's temporary and here is true\nBut what I'm saying is one of the top schools in ... and ... for the latest ATM from the west a as a is ending north okay how good is that the north\nHuh let's look at how good at in the north is a I think there are still waiting lists\nUm yes there oh like now after losing tonight to south more so I'm I'm my point is ... and everyone's going to split again they're going to have another a fourth high school yes there's going to be four count them for that and so I'm just looking at it you cannot and must have not shown themselves to be powers\nI just don't see things can happen all the time\nRight who knew Oklahoma was going to become a state it was much outweigh what\nBut you are but see here's the thing I think they did to shoot holes in your argument because I'm scared to do that right now again thanks\nUm you're using one where you're using the word never\nAnd what sets up well for anybody in any in any one and done situations and that's all you don't have to look that far look at the NC double a tournament you live in the NFL and wanting done situations on any given night\nThink strange things happen and the thing you have to remember and every every football coach will tell you this and it is a complete cliche dries cliches drive me nuts but but this one just for the sake of sake and bringing it up is you don't have to be\nLike you say Edmund Santa Fe when they play genes next week they don't have to be a better team than genes\nFor ten games out of the year they can be better than them on one night\nTo get some breaks go their way that's how it happens now the odds of that probably pretty steep I I don't see I definitely don't you'll west side team especially in Edmond or Norman or ... either one of those school\nEconomy not from dying is the well the other the other problem as as we're talking about before we're on the air is that a west side team is not guaranteed a spot in the state tests\nIn ... game and I might have to be too big time east side schools in order to win a championship might have to be Broken Arrow and then James\n... union and I do I I just went back and look since twenty ten okay\nYou know who's made the title game Lawton twice Norman north twice if you count six say the six day one and six eight to they're not making it to the title games that to happen so I understand what you're saying oh sure and of course I say never and I don't have a clue what's going on okay I don't have a ... I don't have a clue what's going to happen Twenty years from now\nBut my point is I see I've seen the past and I'm not seeing a deal as well I Am scene in those Tulsa area schools a strong focus on youth football as well and that is leading to these programs continually\nBringing out these players and people want to go to the school they want to move into those schools for these programs [noise] fried I violence continues ... by Farm Bureau financial services this is the Oklahoma news network [noise]\n... central we pride ourselves on providing the technology you need to make your banking you see the dark by downloading our mobility will make all your transactions with the latest that date allows you to block transactions on your bank account first between account\nGetting your dream car\nCourse finding more time for hobbies during your retirement whatever your future holds make sure you talk with the farm bureau aging together will create a plan that's right for you find the farm bureau agent that F.

colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst\nGroup and his brand new book is called an alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser\nJohn Bolton is reportedly up pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion ... for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a\nWave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it it should concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons\nAnd to Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world\nThat I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states now practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their their passions\nFor for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great that that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course have captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\n\n\n\nGenuinely blow your business you got married men dry rainy rainy and

the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not\nNot just the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\n[noise] censor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor your own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types\nOf things um uses the cloud etcetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five\nSomewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier that belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure nearby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUm but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of the constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they could show the um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might mean there was there or dominoes at play here obviously and wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nUh but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called

Decatur\nDestroyer a in the grave and race and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos set it flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario a it is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the dog and mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and to establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you\nKnow the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently was after great pressure we put on him a air to want to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely\nWould dispute that so these are issues Syria is you\nKnow clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the pitcher to gather\nYou see the Iranians certainly the Turks are sort of our allies\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so\nA lot of players here confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those\nTroops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians are they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ...\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run a and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants\nTo alternately whether it's just too rich so the the the the ... turkey is\nBuying um\nAir defense systems that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our patriots and other fads too\nTo a Russian S. four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk practice secular rise that nation a\nOr some such as his blah and southern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them or Iran's are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were\nWere they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another fallout from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influence so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia's well here's van Morrison taking us into the break with a band low

Bush draw Iraq Iran North Korea back is illegal now your book is very evil but we are in the long perpetrate evil around the world where these weapons of destruction everywhere even theory or\nOr or or ... did not do one you're going to give people year we're still lives there and that he did so worked or wrong or\n[noise] yeah well I certainly had a question there Richard it it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian of Soviet Union certainly\nWhere they kill millions are under mouth and China where they kill millions\nA and their foreign policy where they\nProvoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support uh yeah we do sell weapons her defense security cooperation agency you know has done a robust year this year the double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is we don't have any friends we just have interests and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder is is evil or certainly in my perspective on I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and I look at what they want today and it's certainly not what my country once\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization as you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world\nThey don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded to the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nFor for no reason in most places in the world\nAre and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims\nAnd of course rated in was in a western China today and that's a un report or somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have the history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that we do bad things\nThat the rest of the world you know I have I've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places and yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to\nThe United states where we enjoy the\nRule of law we aren't afraid is Richard points out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot him they had 'em for our families being carted away and yet unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese

colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military ... group and his brand new book is called an alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times\nFinally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly\nUp pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion ... for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that\nWe've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow cause of concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons\nAnd to Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate and I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states now practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated\nSome might suggest that the United states was poking the bear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of\nA civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes ah\nThat's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David we had the opportunity to\nDo more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course have captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I

and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic\nIt's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful

in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera um that that's\nDisturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds and

Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary a situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know
