order is it is it a six eight and a shorter is it a witch order wizard order what kind of magic quarter is it\nThe cancer and Perry miss the most advanced black magical order in the world and essentially we see the prince of darkness as a a ... and being that doesn't exist inside of physical space time is outside of that is not involved\nUm and does not center around the idea of worship but that to this being can actually be contacted through a actions involving um the highest forms of black magic\nAnd uh we see this being something that we can learn from directly because we can become like it it's the our position is to become God like beans\nOr in a in the elation\nOf his first foreign principle which is responsible for all things in life in the cosmos\nSo we're talking about a dark figure but you have this contract with\nWhether it's on it's dark has its mission it's not generating right it's not Satan saying in in of itself has a\nHas a a a kind of a dumbed down I'm\nA idea of this super consciousness inside of physical space time it's a\nAnd this guy stiff 'em rebellion and a a decadence and I'm a hedonism but uh the ultimate elevated form of this is a stoic looser furry and form\nWhich is where we are uh\nAre actively involved in so I'm forever action there's an opposite and equal reaction so as you see manifestations of ah forms going to a a higher spiritual form or as a decision to to forcefully moved the intellect and the psych\nThrough some physical space toward a higher uh form you're going to the replica ripples\nIn in its back wash that are going to manifest themselves as decadence in degenerate but we're also living inside of the cyclic nature of the Kelly yoga which is a an understanding of cycling time in this position that's happening right now\nIs the degenerate I'm a sales oriented um cosmological construct within the human physical ... of\nAction and form that is at its lowest uh I'm continuing Mitch it's the worst

category him or do they relish this or were they like to see a higher form of been lightened meant that would be more refined satanism\nRunny actually acts absolutely no interest in what happens to the rest of\nThe world no interest at all no we we're we're we're poll bearers of western civilization were just watching it happened the rest of us are just moving toward something that's a continually outside of that\nSo you're waiting for all of us to destroy each other than you guys move in and basically we'd be you know\nWe're not even interested in in in the earth's we're interested in transcending me on even that position when you're inside the one thing that we are really unhappy about the fact that there were so much\nA destruction of the beauty of this planet and a lot of that it's manifested in things such as an animal abused child abuse is happening we think this kind of thing is really a a really horrific actually animal abuse even worse as far as working or because of the true\nI'm a a holders of the of the planet\nYou know they were here before we were and we've come a long ways like eradicated\nA their land um their position\nIn the world you know they're they're sitting there simple rights to live so well actually I don't really like to live well I I is is that the you know we've we've ... overrun all of that and I just think that there should be some kind of vengeful action against that type of thing but it will actually give ... oh yeah absolutely\nUm you know it's interesting because like I said that statement earlier I said satanism now it's harder to find black magically well yeah I mean you will for more you are you talking about ... magic\nBut I'm Talking about how now where the ... the definition of what satanism is it's not easy I remember when I first met you and I talked over a back when you were part of the C O s\nI uh I I was trying to put a handle on what's Satan is believed or at least the way and famous believed\nAnd uh before it wasn't easy to find satanism it's getting even more difficult to divide said da da da da da ... as we go for like a like I said we go for the most ridiculous definitions to the more psychotic\nDefinitions of what it is and I was just curious if this why you left the churches\nSay no I'm ... satanism which is a fairly universally and philosophically recognized as the first manifestation of a true a church devoted to satanism too I'm an acknowledgement at the devil\nI'm as a a as a symbol for um a form of personal internal evolution and that each and every man and woman is their own satanic deity moving to try and become something greater than what they are\nUm there's within the like the last Twenty years there has been literature that has flooded the literal a cottage industry of books that have come out claiming to have been some type of\nOf former ... age old undiscovered um clandestine form of a of the satanic worship\nThat um that you can tap into and that's just not true I'm a scholar of black magic in satanism and I've researched it and it's it's either a um [noise] highly embellished\nIdeas around a satanic Didi or be blatantly meal or manifestations created by people here who are betting that you don't know anything more about it than they do what\nMost people and I remember when I first a ... interview you there are a lot of people who identified with what you say they were saying well we identify with what rex who say we we we been and are either of them and say well I find it uncomfortable because I find it uncovered that I'm agreeing with what he said because of\nYour position in the church and state now you have your own group of black magic magicians and\nI mean your message really hasn't changed all that much only that you seem to be more or less like you said Paul bearers to the fall of western civilization meaning you're standing there watching it all the collapse around you and then you'll be cleaning up and basically we won't be\nCleaning up or escape ing it altogether I mean when I ... I'm just saying that you know I I Am I'm looking at what's happening and I'm I'm recording it but I'm not part of it\nUm the the chaos compare him as a transcendent order when we say transcend that we are talking about the ultimate most uh virile form of spiritual I'm\nA bad at destiny and I just sent so\nI'm the only way that's going to actually happen is to be able to remove oneself from the human equation altogether right okay so\nUm because we see that this this ultimate deity form which actually cannot in any way be defined because she doesn't exist inside of physical space I so if we can talk about what you're trying to use language you want to try to use formula mathematics whatever transcribe you can't really\nDo that it's difficult it's difficult to actually uh quantify I've said this before when I have arguments or aliens and beaming ... demons are mainly a spiritual ended ... to not be quantified it's not touch with\nSome tangible it's something that enters in and wants to have you read on even if not physical it's got a a an energy signature it can be measured and therefore it's a it's a physical made sure that we're headed existing inside of physical space jobless rex will just put on ground zero [noise]\nChaos imperial is the group but he represents formerly the churches Satan and that we're talking about black magic we're talking about the state of the world on Halloween Night Tripoli fix up at three thirty seven hundred extremely fix up at three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis [noise] it was to ground zero we'll be back [noise]\nTruce bumps to haunted Halloween hung on a number four with seven million over the weekend for Seventeen day total of thirty eight million and hunter killer debuted below expectations and fifth place with six million really didn't get a strong a minus cinema score from opening day audiences\nImagine weekend box office we view on hard radio\n[noise] tired of crossing candy ... if the\nGame like no don't miss out on solving thousands of fun\nMommy snack apple no yogurt strawberry waffle you weren't wholesome snacks your kids on something\nTired of crushing candy best teams is the answer is a puzzle game like no other don't miss out on solving thousands of fun puzzles and\nHaiti sci fi limited time making much you can get to complete pair of glasses frames lenses work and\nPeople still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it\nReally settling is\nRushing didn't loan payment but do people degree from nova save you a ton of money it's college and I\nDon't think you're settling with no education\nYummy try ... strawberry waffle real tried strawberries credit you often crashed and crashed ...
