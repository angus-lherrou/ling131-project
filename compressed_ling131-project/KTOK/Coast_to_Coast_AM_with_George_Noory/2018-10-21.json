be yourself and you're you're the one I don't want to get an email\nI Would love that you that you are you calling in and it's interesting case because you look you've got to make a decision either

a very bad or we stop with the with the BS benefits for people\nUm on on but based on identity politics and maybe just maybe we are required opportunity to everybody I Know I I Know it's crazy I I Know we'll just go throw it out there ... lives in Georgia Jim what's going on\nLike the first time caller and I just want to hear what your audience after listening to shale\nUm I used to work for UPS I'm retired now and it's about Nineteen Ninety five for Nineteen Ninety four she gives me\nA there was a business to open up on my route and an abortion clinic and I didn't know until I went in but I I could feel that even in the oil and I looked around and I I just wonder why these women could do this but the lady the receptionist or and this was the first time in there and I had a hand truck load stuff and\nThe lady the reception has told me to take it to the last show on the left\nJust put it by the window so I you know I went back to the last ... last and they put it that by the window and it was a trash can there and I look into the trash can Joe and there were there a little baby sharks and their middle fingers are\nAnd I I definitely sick and I just I cut down you know it just and I used to they uh they get up out against abortion except at a rate you know but that changed my mind right there and then when I went back to have a lady or at the reception sign for it\nThey had a a lack of being right there and I got started that led to it\nJust ask her what it was and she said miss their new catalog and\nYellowish it was just like a ... catalog or or or Sears catalog and a half a T park\nAnd ah at prices for a full arms fingers and I was just something new and she was you know uh but you know thank goodness I I didn't have to go back and I told my boss to fire me if I went back in their\n... listen to your story use is startling good certainly read that you shared it but I I got to be honest with you I'm a bind but there was a JC penny type catalog with baby parts on it I I mean it had to be something other than a catalog well what is it what you saw a ...\nI'm\nI'm close to call it a catalogue as a title on the front where did say\nI didn't I didn't even look at it 'cause I was struggling through it and ask her why she signed up for it and I'm a born again Christian I wouldn't lie to you I mean I Know what I saw\nNo you you you you sound like I'm just really honest guy I just do that there was a catalog\nWith baby hearts would be an obvious obviously has been exposed through undercover investigation that a lot of these abortion providers orange back dealing and baby parts body parts of his disgusting it makes me sick I Would be ... we'd be startled if you saw a JC penny like catalogue with baby parts which to\nMe I mean maybe maybe you're describing maybe you're describing it incorrectly ... wasn't a catalog what'd you do you know shopping for close to that that could be\nIt ... it was ... and I looked at ... had baby parks with prices by him I I notice I Do I I'm not going to like this\nIs what would you not only to get offended but but I find it extremely hard to believe the other part of your story I find to be very believable and I'm Sorry that you ... you just say one thing you could say whatever you want boat I'm saying is if you can't tell me what the title of the catalog was I mean you're actually tonia some through like a JC penny catalog that makes no sense to me\nWhen I went through it I just I Wish [laughter]\nAs horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid as as as horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid enough to leave a book like that around for anybody to see\nIt had just come in the mail she had was brand new\nBut the thing I Want to I Want to it's just like you know a cabin on hearing and the lady that she was traumatized\nAnd I don't buy it for it because you get your traumatized you elaborate things that that happened I I mean I tell ya where I was I Can't tell you I mean they're staying traumatized me and I know what I saw\nI I Believe you you saw something like that I'm here to tell you I Know I saw a ... a lot to Jim Jim take a breath I Know to me five ... do you think you saw it I Believe you're just going to keep talking not gonna help anybody because you and I are the same side but let me say it again I Believe ...\nThat let you go I loved the gym I Love you like crazy we can't we can't have it where you're trying to talk over me of WB sense I listen to the story which is a very intriguing story give me three or four minutes but I'm I'm here to tell you that part I don't believe that you saw a catalog it looks like a JC penny catalog\nSitting around somewhere for anybody to see where you get some through it in bars fetuses and baby parts or whatever do they deal in things like that yes or you write that it's disgusting yes you are\nDo I believe that there was a good listening maybe I'm getting the wrong idea of what a JC penny got all August\nWhich to me that's a catalog that used them through the pictures of models wearing clothing or or lawn mowers or appliances\nI'm not buying that there was a magazine that did that now if somebody else up here has seen a magazine catalog what you talking about at an abortion clinic a listen\nAbsolutely and as I said before you started with ... um I Believe you believe you saw it\nBut I find it hard to believe that that exists or that the abortion clinic was dumb enough to leave something like that around but let me like a brother it is a one eight hundred

Ron deceived as he's a Republican former congressman great state of Florida running for governor of humor now Rick Scott is running for Senate he was the governor is the governor now and the ... the\nDemocrat nominee for governor who's a far left wing socialist a run I appreciate you how're you doing good how are you doing\nNow living the dream it really glad to have you on it would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there are a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people throw my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and help things are going\nWell they really why I mean we thought I'm born and raised in Florida we've seen a lot of dawn on one hand\nYou have better Ninety two but it's the worst damage I mean I turned to Panama Sandy in terms of Mexico beach in some of the area so I'm a I'm a bell servants rising wants to turn away out um they're starting to get power back off\n\nOn a structural damage because you had basically about category by\nUm I talked to some of this year they're um they're actually progress thing a lot about how to schedule which is good I thank God\nYou know one of that around neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the end the debate but it'd be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's just certain amount of damage that we're going to have a you know\nIt's secondary obviously we're talking around to see it as former congressman he's a Republican running for governor ... um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that voting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are\nTraditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast um are going to be out there is that getting to handle the jacket and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is\nThey'll probably be extraordinary accommodations or the people that work display or ... to either stay on the county yeah but I think you're looking at having additional polling location and then I think they're going to be\nA consideration for if you are or you can vote and other county uh your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that\nAnd by that that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they will look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time\nThese are resilient people I don't you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very stiff minded so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of this debt to deal with\nAppreciate having ... and a five to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor of the great state of Florida rung you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years and I love the way to go back all the time my mom was there and my sisters are there and I suddenly understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there is there is a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern bureau Florida that is very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center right or center left but a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guy that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County huge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics like Venezuelans\nAnd the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism they don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually\nDoesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country had been in the Congress\nThe elements hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent in the ... movement against Israel they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great that huge at one level\nJose Gillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA tunnel indivisible capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause the Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't they find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left\nA which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's ... he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government is also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants\nMedicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic or I've never met\nA Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon\nWhy is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic vote is not monolithic I mean in Florida\n[noise]\n\nYou're likely to have you welcome you to use the weekend with Joe patch one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty\n... dot com [noise]\nFacebook Twitter is ... ... email the live video feed is there is well my heritage are listed there the interviews the monologues go check it out we resented the entire site and I'd be interested in what you think about it when we go to the bowl large their little light Jew H ... who's in New York I don't know what's going on\nI like to make a couple of comments and see what you're thinking you're listening thank God I didn't know how I have heard that they're studies showing an increase in polio and TV\nI Know I'm Wondering you know I Know the drug problem in gangs and terrorists but why are we paying more attention\nBecause of how I that's my comment my second comment is I'm I'm taking a course at a local college and and I even though you can watch on the news\nNobody wanted and I have to say I'm probably one of the least popular student in my in my class\nAnd then thirdly yeah\nMovement that we're experiencing now I don't think it was just overnight I think in the back in the mid thirties we add another socialist which we overcame but\nI don't think they ever gave up I think they don't try I my comment in fact be interested in hearing what you think about that\nNorm I think those are great comments and you're right there was a poll polio white I'm speaking that's going around an instructor was a U.S senator yesterday and they're calling you polio like paralysis that's happened to your children something called a a family and we still need to pay attention about my my father a big body of\nWhat were you when he was little and and um that was a real big problem back in the day we allegedly overcame what there's something else going on now and yeah there are real health issues are real you know\nHealth issues to the general public when we're talking about the drug um or the outbreak that we're seeing now you're seeing some cities are dominant three handing out needles to people do they think that's going to stop the spread of disease I mean you've got illegals coming across the border where you have no idea of what their medical condition is and when you\nAsk you about your shoulder racist so yeah these are important questions hopefully the president as you can actually over your issue in this country I Am asking you\nWorks to close the border and build the wall hopefully use also were dressing you know as a byproduct these issues that you brought up as far as going to college in this day and age you got a bunch of lemmings a bunch of drones that have been trained by um by professors that are either hippies themselves or leftovers from socialist wannabe you drug induced to for use\nIn the day I've never seen 'em or I never thought that I Would see in my life a group of people that we look at it as a A R O U D election all elite\nAccess stupidly NBC so incredibly incorrect and on the wrong side of just about everything you truly your stomach to me I'm ... and you're right the first socialism and the control of the masses has been around for as long as the man has been on our\nAge never going to stop that's why we can't stop the other side can stop pushing back\nWhen you have to push back we have to say this is it okay for me this is an okay for my America this is an okay for one by what my family to be left with when I Move on that's really how you take care of it let me go to um candy who's in a in Florida and he got about a minute for you what's happening\nAnd I\nGo online that's diamond in the movie did you go on line or two Democrats the movie dot com they go there because they should be able to tell you weren't flying there's nothing near you\nTalk to him all the time they're good friends on I'll find out what the story user dimension being widely distributed um I thought that that would tell you that you'd be able to do with the word is where you are in a United States flag is settled law law lawn ornament there's something wrong with anybody who would you think about ah let me see er\nI don't have a longer time I've got like thirty seconds for your great Megan fast go\nHey this is Greg ... Florida last night or whatever\nOr or the other day and opened up my official John election sample ballot and there's a note on yeah it says Haskell county is under a dish award or provide each sample ballot Spanish within the next election how could they how could\nThey do that never ever ever never happened you got to be a US citizen to vote you should have a ... on an understanding of English as well got to go to Ryan in the morning you'll see you next week\nOr semi automatic\nOn Eric I this is Martha Stewart now you can ... great chasing the nursing home and you forget about friends in some cases instead of me for green says the same market and released their meal parishioners fresh ingredients it's my wonderful either ... or a brain tumor\nAnd right yeah you can try to eat for free and married and then they get time I'm offering three three Martha and morally meals to every one\nWay or imagine cooking better be used to stay here for ten years like chicken and more like a new basically every le Mars and money to help you at least you're getting your on your cable and around in\nA free meal I mean I'm forty six eight time worrying if you're looking for a detail free won't last long\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn that one part in the future of this country for the foreign contract the getting out and going to make\nA smart Trump or we love having or on each and Laura Lee Trump on Twitter writes\nAbout the crap out right now\nI'm just saying and I follow you and your husband maybe I'm just going to say I haven't gotten to follow them\nWhen I was perfectly fine or a or a health care free shipping 'em or you\nKnow it's interesting that you bring a cabinet have been calling at the Capitol about what had happened shortly but I feel like things might cool down before the midterms in Dianne Feinstein yesterday like gave us a gold and\nSomebody asks for if you guys when the Senate if the Democrats win the Senate will you reopen investigations into no justice cabinet Laura she said yes\nYeah well that that's not surprising anyone because he saw how crazy\nThey got during the actual confirmation contacts\nIt's really terrifying it finally showing their true colors that Democrats really don't stand firm I kept trying to get stronger and make it go against the president and your strike and then I'll tell you\nI never even seen that you don't like it or to get out there can be kind of actually winning you don't try and stop them\nI don't really think you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is winning for the country again and and they know that he's draining the swamp and they were terrified because the old way of life is over and they knew before and and it's very scary for people who are living the highlights in Washington DC\nAre not going in and and voting on behalf of their constituents so it makes them scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he's\nHe's doing this because he loves his country now as a whole anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before um which is all the more reason that we need all the Republican support we can in Congress\nThat is a lawyer Trump but really great to talk to you if your brother in law I asked the ... I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this\nWhat was your knee jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process what it looked like\nYour mother in law was really going to take the stuff\nYeah I actually that all of them down and said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous athlete or a\nDay during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it wouldn't get to this level rise up\nBut but I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew that my father in law can do this job he's a businessman the is do smart when it comes to negotiating you see when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what pair of trade um\nHe's really great at that than I knew back then he would be great at it um for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um it it it's so much bigger than any of us but\nThat's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future and the country and if\nWe can take a couple of planes and arrows here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and countries ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or her husband was there with her father in law is the president ... Mbeki twenty six teams of because you've just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the electric come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I knew that they were trying to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty and forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on the television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been a newsroom for a long time as well yesterday le left but I didn't know was going to be like this so\nWhat what it was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and I ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because I Would be\nAll different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it was very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for forever if you know he became president ...\nBut um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn\nChild I mean they talk about it is it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to think came president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their own way of life was going to come to an end so\nUm I have to say that it it's just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you ever ... have any family members you to my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband and father in law of course is\nThe president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can see that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote\nIn Texas where I should you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent he was doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your brother in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being challenged from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know he's a former left wing socialist disco ward you look at places like Michigan were Debbie Stabenow has been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show that Israel's seat this really use gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the ... you can go vote for him is really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I speak to you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will be on your day ironically and Michigan I'm miss it so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's what a lot of people against and even people in his own party sometimes money and get them to\nThink about what could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted along side president and and really pushes agenda forward\nWe can see so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what social and them look like the look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states and America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward\nIt's really very frightening socialism has never work the fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that should shock everybody to a degree that you you not only are going to get out and do it in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nUm it it's very area and I know that it felt like a fight and twenty things seem to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly was the fight isn't over you and you can't get back we can't relax we can't be complacent me half to get out\nAnd got to vote and put people in Congress who we are going to vote with the president\nIs running if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to W. issues are delicious who's his wife is from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting is there are people waiting in line for food and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first students may him in the country it is horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country because you've ...\nYou've got people who are actually showing this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nLower last question I really appreciate your time and by the way of blood or in Minnesota we go for breach stations or we were very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul and keep your kids are hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying voters suitable impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cut you can take more of your money away it will drive jobs out of the country\nThat's what they're running on and the factors there almost fifty fifty right now almost every poll you see what is it that we're doing wrong you went to ... done junior the president's ... the Fox news sanity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close it's crazy to me\nWell I don't know Joe that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the\nCold War and ... and a great point I don't really think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid to tell a pollster that call them or\nThem on the street said they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood has done such a a number on on people whenever they come out in support of the president or as a Republican and um so I think it does make people a little\nHesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] no\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nHey\n[laughter] I mean what are your stations across the land Joe ... ... email all the more weight there was a live video feed as well plus the\nBlaze radio network it's the weekend with Joe ... won a hundred ... all one Seventy eighty\nJoe ... said a ... is a great political commentator ripped off their shoes and investigative\nJournalist she's got her on television show and she also was his mental and raising money for this ... movie the movie about the abortion doctor that was killing people\nUm who is now ... sentences behind bond prison bars wanted to get what they were about how hard it was to raise money for the movie plus of course we have a dog Pocahontas were abducted germs Michel ...\nGood how are you doing I'm doing great ... taken a ton of want to jump into the ... uh which sort of piqued my interest the other day that's why I reached out to you but acute knocks dark with Elizabeth Warren of turns out he was one one thousand twenty four\nNative American so I'm Out in the left media the show now says she's basically white good uh Cherokee queen [laughter] that's right what am I missing here\nShe has been vindicated I I'm I'm I'm never\nFlabbergasted by the lengths to which\nThe identity politics left will go to write you try and unwind\nBlatant life this is a woman who advanced her career by manufacturing a Native American ancestry that it's been debunked over and over and over again and I I really do believe that her staff was\nConvinced that by releasing the results of tests\nThat showed that she possibly\nHad Native American ancestry six to ten generations back yeah but that was based on a proxy of Native American blood line right and in other words the researcher\nUsed South American genetic markers or some sort of of estimation for whether or not she really at this ancestry come on Joe this is someone who identified as a woman of color right in order to secure position in a in a prestigious Ivy League university\nIn a very real way Rachel does all is about as black is this woman is Native American and you're right you're using like ... as Dr hoping they're praying that the south American blood somehow has some native blood and there is no proof in other words she's wider than I'll ever be a fight and in\nFact by statistics that were quoted and none other than the New York times it turns out that this one one one one thousand twenty four fraction of a possible Native American bloodline makes makes sure her last\nIn other words that that the average white American right more Native American ancestry than she does\nA hundred percent but you're absolutely right about that in the Boston Globe tried to say that she was one thirty second at the uh\nThe most and one one thousand twenty four at the least they even had to update that four hours later to say okay maybe one sixty fours at at the moment [laughter] was it was an I'm Italian I'm English I'm polish and Irish or you know these things and I'm I'm I'm actually about\nTwo thirds Italian the snow falls into place I have no clue one one thousand sixty fours anything else\nAnd nobody can ever we I don't think you'd never really find that out but they have one tiny little marker on one time ... scale amazing Trump's you don't need a million dollars in apologized or help me understand\nYeah yeah you know the the rich irony in a serious point is that this week I'm a very important cases being litigated by legitimate Asian American students have um suit Harvard University which awarded\nElizabeth Warren this a position as a as a professor right because of her fake claim and those Asian American students have on earth do all sorts of admissions\nDocuments showing that they were discriminated because they were Asian American and there were too many of them in the university system and it just goes to show you that you know the the ... the Olympics of grievance and the Olympics of identity politics brings us exactly to the to this point in time and it and it's\nAnd it and I think so many people are sick and tired of it I mean for the twenty five plus years that I have been an outspoken conservative quote unquote of color and yeah I'm darker than Brock Obama\nI've had all of these white progressive left is shouting at me that I'm not really my ethnicity because of my beliefs\nAnd that to me really is is the real offense here of of white liberal progressive telling true legitimate quote unquote people of color that they're not people of color while they're bracing phony like Rachel do at all and and Elizabeth Warren\nAnd all through shown getting in there as well yes now ... dot com boom to read her blog or what you do the room as you know you're going to reduce showing your TV where she's at noon incredible investigative reporting um I wanted to talk to about ... I didn't know what your attachment was doing ... turns out it was really hard to\nRaise money for this movie it's basically a movie about\nWell it's actually called the wine with America's biggest serial killer I Believe this guy was America's biggest serial killer one show so much trouble to make obviously a very interesting um ... million one story\nWell of the bottom line is that the a radical abortion is in the Democratic party and on the left\nI Do not want to acknowledge the horrors that are committed in the name of so called reproductive choice and my attachment to the movie into the story goes back to two thousand eleven when almost nobody else was paying attention to the story and I first blogged about the grand jury report\n\n\nLike great to have you it is the weekend with Joe ... re devilish of all\nGood on corrupt the blues that you've got to love the show ...\nThat's the exact perfect me for any sort of a tour that Hillary Clinton indoor dog would do would go on to do it together forget about it in by the way um there was a new story on drug drug friday that suggested Hillary Clinton is considering yet another road to ...\n... ...\nWhat on earth this woman thinks that she is owed so big it is so weird to me my goodness oh there you go to the vote was a lot of people want to be heard that in a lot of different topics that we get out it's going to be New York and Victoria I've a jury what's going on\nHow Joe thanks for taking my call you about people coming across\nThe border at the same time which I don't like we don't think it's gonna happen thank God but um I was wondering I'm I wanted to get your take on what you think about that [laughter]\nI don't think these people have banning are elated no shot at all I can just imagine that the reason that they're going to be coming over with and we're going to be catching now that you know all the children what do you think\nAnd I know there was there there is no doubt I'm ... you'll you'll be where you are a good way I wanted to I wanted\nYour debit yeah they they they got that they they run the show a little bit bit delayed would just buy a beer is no doubt in my mind that that we can't know whether these people were healthy or not we don't know if they're breeding diseases we get that's why we have the legal process by which people can come here\nBut I think that she hung up I just I just don't mark that not just tell her that she can't hear it because they're running our abide\nBy that I I Try to stay stay one either what a majority it's a good question and we don't know it certainly is a health issue for our country\nAnd for people and when you bring that up you would think that the you know the hollering loving and caring sympathetically afterwards say oh but you're right we should look out for our children to understand it's not really about have you bought a year it's about people who were coming here\nBecause the less for some reason for this or something so much it's a very strange to me it would really question the question like is going to be Mike in Michigan like what's going on\nHigh or just want to make it on the numbers are so scared right now okay\nOh that's working class just all around the country or set up a alive crap aside or actually a lot more democratic or we call I got\nI get calls during the day to get my are or how we can go after suffering well\nI'd never in my life like it'd be even better so I don't know what the hell they're talking to you it's not me\nI get I get a call ... while on\nEvery day you know what I think about the kind of ...

I'd I Would have to see that case that doesn't make any sense obviously I mean obviously I was obviously people who are weren't born in in Africa are being called African American now when certainly are racially able to write that it doesn't really matter what your race is um if you are in fact\nOf African heritage you should be able to claim that not all if there's a there's there's no box for

gotta send it to be yourself and use it you're going out and get an email\nI Would love to do that joy appreciate your calling it it's interesting case because you look you've got to make a decision either anybody of African heritage is a person that gets this benefit or bad or anybody I'm Hispanic heritage is against this benefit or that or anybody you know an Asian or heritage businessmen of it or that or we\nWe're going to BS benefits for people um on on but based on identity politics and maybe just maybe we all ... to ... to everybody I Know I I Know it's crazy\nI Know\nWhat was going to throw it out there ... lives in Georgia Jim what's going on\nLike a first time caller and I just want to hear what your audience after listening to shale\nUm I used to work for UPS I'm retired now and it's about Nineteen Ninety five for Nineteen Ninety four she gives me\nA there was a hell of a business to open up on my route you know that's an abortion clinic and I didn't know until I went in but I I could feel the evil in the oil and I looked around and I I just wonder why these women could do this but\nThe lady the receptionist or and this was the first time in there and I had a hand truck load stuff and\nThe lady the reception has told me to take it to the last show on the left and just put it by the window so I you know I went back to the last ... left and they put it that by the window and it was a trash can there and I'll look into the trash can go and there were there a little baby parked in their middle fingers are\nAnd I I definitely sick and I just I cut down you know it just and I used to be a ... about an anti abortion except under rate you know but that changed my mind right there and then when I went back to have the lady uh at the reception sign for it\nThey had a a lack of being right there and I\nKind of started that led to it I just ask her what it was and she knew catalog and\nIt was it was just like a ... catalog or or or stares catalog and a half a T park and ah at prices for a photo finishes arms fingers\nAnd I was just it was something new and she was you know uh but you know thank goodness I didn't have to go back and I told my boss to fire me if I went back in their\n... listen to your story use is startling good certainly rather you shared it but I I got to be honest with you I'm a bind but there was a JC penny type catalog with baby parts on it I mean it had to be something other than a catalog well what does it mean I don't know what you saw what was going to\nGo out and\nI'm usually called the catalogue as a title on the front would have to say\nI didn't I didn't even look at it 'cause I watched ... through it and ask her why she signed up for it and I'm a born again Christian I wouldn't lie to you I mean I Know what I saw\nNo you you you you sound like I'm just really honest guy I just believe there was a catalog\nWith baby hearts would be an army is obviously has been exposed through undercover investigation that a lot of these abortion providers orange bag dealing in baby Parchin body parts it was disgusting it makes me sick I Would be ... we'd be startled if you saw a JC penny like catalogue would baby parts which to\nMe I mean maybe maybe you're describing maybe you're describing it incorrectly ... was it a catalog what'd you do you know shopping for close to that that could be\nIt it was it at I look in there and it had baby parks with prices by him I I notice I go out for not going to like this\nIs what would you not only to get offended but but I find it extremely hard to believe the other part of your story I find to be very believable and I'm Sorry that you ... you know you and I say one thing you could say whatever you want bought I'm saying is if you tell me what the title of a catalog was\nI mean you're actually tonia song through like a JC penny catalogued it makes no sense to me\nWhen I went through it I just I Wish [laughter]\nAs horrible as abortion providers are they're not do it as as horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid enough to leave a book like that around for anybody to see\nIt had just come in the mail she had was brand new\nBut the thing I Want to I Want to it's just like you know Kevin ... and the lady said she was traumatized\nAnd I don't buy it for it because you if you're traumatized you elaborate things that that happened I I mean I tell ya where I was I can tell you I mean they're staying traumatized me and I know what I saw\nI I I Believe you you saw something like that I'm here to tell you know I saw a ... a lot of Jim Jim ... I Know to me five ... you saw it I Believe you're just going to keep talking not going to help anybody because you and I are on the same side but let me say it again I Believe ...\nThat let you go I loved the gym I Love your like crazy we can't we can't have it where you try to talk over me a sense I listen to the story which is a very intriguing story give you three or four minutes but I'm I'm here to tell you that part I don't believe that you saw a catalog it looks like a JC penny catalog\nSitting around somewhere for anybody to see where you get some through it in bars fetuses and baby parts or whatever do they deal with things like that yes are you write that it's disgusting yes you are\nDo I believe that there was a good listening maybe I'm getting the wrong idea of what a JC penny got all August\nBut to me that's a catalog that used them through the pictures of models wearing clothing or or lawn mowers or appliances\nI'm not buying that there was a magazine that did that now if somebody else up here has seen a magazine catalog what you talking about at an abortion clinic a listen\nAbsolutely and as I said before you started with over ... ...

as he's a Republican\nFormer congressman break state of Florida running for governor of humor now Rick Scott is running for Senate he was the governor is the governor now and the ... the Democrat nominee for governor who's a far left wing socialist\nA run I appreciate you how are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing I'm living the dream it really glad to have you on it would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there are a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people throw my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and help things are going\nWell they really why I mean we thought I'm born and raised in Florida we've seen a lot of dawn on one hand\nYou have that in Ninety two but that's the worst damage I mean I turned to Panama Sandy and in terms of Mexico beach in that area so\nI'm a I'm a bell servants rising wants to turn away out um they're starting to get power back off\nOn a structural damage because you had basically about category I\nUm I talked to some of the Arabs they're um they're actually progress thing a lot about how to schedule which is good I thank God\nYou know one of that threat neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the end the debate but it'd be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's just certain amount of damage that we're going to have a you know\nIt's secondary obviously we're talking around to see it as former congressman he's a Republican running for governor ... um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that\nVoting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast I'm going to be out there is that getting to handle the jacket and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations or the people that work display\nOr just the people you're still in the county yeah so I think you're looking at having additional\nPolling location and then I think they're going to be a consideration for if you are just a you can vote and other county uh your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that and by that that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they well look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very stiff minded so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of this\nDebt to deal with I think they will have an opportunity to cast a vote\nIs a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor of the great state of Florida rung you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida was there for Twenty one years old I Love the ... go back all the time my mom was there my sisters are there and I thought I understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there is there is a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming and and the southern Europe learned about it is very heavily populated he's used habit of fight whether it's center right or center left but a lot of like the school districts and school board\nAnd and a lot of the the sheriff's officers do lean left or how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guy that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics like Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home countries are we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country that had been in Congress\nYelling and hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which has prominent into bbs movement against Israel they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great\nThat you get one of those it Gillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA total of indivisible capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause a Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more anti Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't this time they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really aligned with the radical left a which\nIs really a very hostile to Israel now\nHe's in he's like he's really he's also a part of freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government is also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's\nIt's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon\nWhy is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy don't the day that they have always been able to I think that the the Hispanic vote is not monolithic I mean in Florida\nYou know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics in South Florida um and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nLike great to have your welcome to use the weekend with Joe ... one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty\n... dot com [noise]\nFacebook Twitter Instagram emailed a live video feed is there is well my heritage are listed there the interviews the monologues go check it out we redesigned the entire site and I'd be interested in hearing what you think about it when we go to the ... why do they know about who's in New York I don't know what's going on\nI like to make a couple of comments and see what your trunk and you're listening thank God I didn't know how I heard that that is showing an increase in polio on TV I Know I'm Wondering you\nKnow I Know a drug problem in gangs and terrorists but why are we paying more attention\nTo how I got a comment I can come back in time I'm taking a look at a local college and and I didn't do you watch on the news\nNobody wanted and I have to say I'm probably one of the popular in my in my class\nAnd thirdly yeah\nMovement that we're experiencing now I don't think it was\nJust overnight I think in the back in the mid thirty we add another socialist on which we all the time but I don't think they gave up I think he'll try I my comment in fact be interested in hearing what you think about that\nNormal I think those are great comments and you're right there was a poll polio white\nI'm speaking that's going around an instructor was a U.S senator yesterday and they're calling it\nPolio paralysis that's happened to your children to something called a a family and we still need to pay attention about my my father because he ... he was little and um that was a real big problem back in the day we allegedly over Cambridge but there's something else going on now and yeah there are real health issues are real you know\nHealth issues to the general public when we're talking about the drug or a or B outbreak there we're seeing now\nYou're seeing some cities are dumb enough to be hitting got needles to people that I think that's going to stop the spread disease but you've got illegals coming across the border we have no idea of what their medical condition is that when you ask about that you are called a racist so yeah these are important questions hopefully the presidents\nAs you tax the opiate issue in this country or an assay works\nTo to close the border to build the wall hopefully he's also addressing\nYou know as a byproduct these issues that you brought up as far as going to college in this day and age you got a bunch of lemmings a bunch of drones that have been trained by um by professors that are either hippies themselves or leftovers from socialist want to be drug induced tip you use in the day I've never seen\nA or I never thought that I Would see in my life a group of people that we look at it as a as our ... elite\nXO stupidly it'd be so incredibly incorrect and on the wrong side of just about everything you truly your stomach to me I'm ... and you're right the push for socialism and the control of the masses has been around for as long as the man has been on earth\nIt's never going to stop that's why we can't stop the other side to stop pushing back\nWe have to push back we have to say this is an okay for me this was an okay for my America this was an okay for what by what my family to be left with when I Move on and that's really how you how you take care of it let me go to I'm Judy who's in a in Florida gator got about a minute for you what's up but\nI Do I just want to say it's a matter of what they want to take a call and I'm looking for the Democrats and I can't find that in my area at all and I

in September twenty twelve he spoke with a prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty

am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em\nBecause you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and\nHe really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics\nWe're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right in there and have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find these people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know as say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer would take a picture and\nAnd the you know the fake media would be totally surprising where are you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to\nPull off his mask and so these guys are very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry write them\nUp that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it would just I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually\nUm there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did\nBut a jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini

Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas his website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nI think it was about [noise] a couple of years after the say on he was in a really bad car accident he was with his ...\nEyes car accident and his healing processes hated by painkillers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted them morphine and he for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes it was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before\nNow what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret to do the trick is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on us Thomas or I Am not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but\nMaybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop\nHis son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this they out and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case as fun as it is and as exciting as it is it is not going to be the first break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no\nI I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight\nShe doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do step on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement\nThe end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote a wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open\nMinded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now since here in my desire to undo this

Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing\nBut you know again I'm history books being what they are that times are you the last um\n[noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Burma and she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close\nEngland came to losing your island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this is what their MO was they used to go in weight on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially France\nAnd they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course the because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with a brush\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he ate style and doesn't want anything to do with um never trust them\nI'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who\nGather together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar to the time\nThat style and in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we want to be from\nShow to answer your question around about fashion um church show like that for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to be homeless vowing only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand we weren't\nGetting things from Russia we didn't know much about that rate for I think of FDR had known about butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been a strand of course we weren't getting that\nUntil decades and decades later\nRight yeah the New York times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure I ... I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying or pieces are ...\nMillion FDR it seemed to have them in reading your book an FDR was very anxious to get a face to face was down and I don't know if this was because he admired him or like when he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStolen didn't need us we need it style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good they're doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horses in midstream and go toward styling\nRead um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they will just says well I don't care I Want to do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us so\nHitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran\nI think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct\nThey have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA skilled at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still looks pretty robust or you know he you know my my standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOne by one he knocked

leaders is is absolutely incredible we haven't even talked about this year I'm you know it was it's been used as a legitimate weapon sense three thirty one B. C.\nI got everyone from a recipe it into the apostle John in the Bible isn't poison and political poisonings hit their peak right around the renaissance Italian Renaissance on the fourteenth\nCentury and even today food tasters are used to sort of navigate that um you know everything [laughter]\nAnd here's some people who have actually tried to poison other people throughout history\nOr you know it sounds outlandish that our president can be poisonous wherever it's it's actually quite a kind of thing\nThe emperor Claudio us the pole in Mark Anthony Neal Petra Queen Elizabeth King Henry the eighth Abraham Lincoln these people all were so worried about poison and they all had foods officers so they were a little bit more sophisticated about this\nWe actually have um\nIn America we have the presidential food safety thing and there's a set up\nA security zone where the first family can eat without complication then they can cockpit of a you know food screeners and people who watch

article\nHoudini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm way Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we just practice I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be fraud where did that you know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um that\nKind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics\nWe're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and he would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and you'd be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in the abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer who take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprised if it were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA joy ... was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife uh we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... to find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did\nBreak off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and\nIn his mind putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to ...\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit was surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware\nOf who d'nese reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid was I going to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got a jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best

discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website in Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens\nHe was in a really bad car accident and he was with his sister ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile say\nAnd I I'm with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike\nNow pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the ... do you do on its own that\nYou're kind of breaking up on us Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very steel and speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James Pike\nThis is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research\nBrings it into the than says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case as fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his medium abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it that it does or doesn't I I just it it it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do the same ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden\nShe's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's do that on the top one will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and\nSo I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to do this mistake\nHow all those lost

living the paradox of enlightenment\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini he's um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they want it to kill him but I think they wanted to say\nBack off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that uh\nYoung student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and they were having them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time that\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why it passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for\n'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry Reid show up with it\n... from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer we take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprising you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it would I just wanted to ask you briefly about a ... is there are so Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and\nI think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] but do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading\nNow we get into the say aunts and and uh we should back up and explain that aren't Houdini deathbed in Detroit\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I Am a bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best [noise]\nWell I'm not interested in it but I just want to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause back and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and how we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother here it she had already passed the spirit Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and then hit on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to ...\nWell that gets this letter and she really bond in writing the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul spirit was surviving gap and so she got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur\nFord was well aware of who ... his reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid Thomas I got to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in with a
