phone lines they'll let me say hello and welcome to align one each Lisa in California Hi Lisa\nHi how are you living the dream which habit of\nCalling um I actually ties into what the last caller was talking about um with the shooting how how you get that\nChurches physically forget I mean there are a whole nother story in our movie theaters and other places tricky ... how would you get that at church\nHey action sort out the bad guys again versus the good guy with a gun and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy you know and I certainly\nWhen I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility not only protect myself that anybody that night and it might come under attack against the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a church is a ... that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas still allowed to in many places but at the same time they are also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that\nPoint if you're going to if you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is this if you're not going to allow me to carry my gun in\nAnd you should but if you're not going to allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun that you weren't too to get a license foreign you've gone through the classes for a and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we could look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado\nThat guy quite literally avoided six southern theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns but once the interview tacked did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their twelve people died\nSo we are I think that you have to work in conjunction to synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't um or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance and exit\nThis way anybody getting ... getting out or anybody getting getting me there can be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility and and they want to cause harm\nYou're gonna you're gonna identify them before they can pull the trigger one time\nSure and I got ... they can certainly get it at a church\nWill they will be doing it in the in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so so but people that we pay to be our legislators are representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House\nYou can't get anywhere near the place until you have a full body scan so why can't they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah it is I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play and like I say that the economic a\nFull body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know those are those are those items that it's not just\nThat have an accent that the people around now and then the church probably qualified people that are going to be there any way to get out that kind of ended up in their training and call and right now I just feel like it\nLike I said it's not just I don't agree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost more ... think that it's not a realistic\nWell I I I think you'll you'll carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by guys like you and me\nCongregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through stuff to get the license to be able to carry like but also you you just have a bus system where you

eleven days it was a\n... there were living amazing days come on let's\nAppreciate I had a great time you know fortunately I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat but um you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president of loyal to the president\nYou know I did some a media this morning I was on CNN and try to spend what I said that I call the president a liar it's not what I said the president is telling the it's like that and he's curbing the truth is doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger in your eyeball 'cause he knows it's\nGoing to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rocker\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've been working CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean when you walk in it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there was a definitive spin\nWhen you walk into that ... did you know you really get you know some some folks from them and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these at or this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figured that could kill me with the base but that's fine people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I got fired Fifteen months ago I was it loyal to the president's Joe you would have figured it out by now or I wrote a very ... very funny book\nAbout my relationship with him you know what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were like young\nYou know his father's deceased but I'm back in the seventies when his dad was working with him and mentoring in what they were like so this was a real fun book to write a rocket called yesterday uh she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent but Bush said\nIt was great each couldn't wait to show it to her father Kurt ... one of his best friend said the same thing you know 'cause I listen I\nI I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing last too bad I'm In New York or I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... of course short for pack and we will so why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like yesterday I got to tell you\nMy mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it the you know then it there's micro aggressions Reagan president state your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional\nFeeling you could ever politically incorrect things just stay a and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they are offended by right\nThere was a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place now like a Stradivarius that he does a ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm ... my personality\nBut I agree it's embodies or move to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president he's out now going up his great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he's running for president were you a surprise I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him but he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies\nAnd you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media you know that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and uh\nIt took him a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely looked for a cost an out and tries to tell me your fake news editor at a cost to eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but it but again if I thought it was really really good pick\nUp a time I understand what happened but um when you were in that job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you did you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price\nI thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought that would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what Adam and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe ... era as the press secretary I did the first press conference\nAnd I'm so sorry that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team\nAnd also want to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net my counseling\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets contacts yeah\nHe was being very of seat we than flattering to me and he begging me effectively to do a profile story with him yeah trail me around and I was like well I'm not Steve Bannon and I'm not there are self promoting myself when I\nUse of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that guy changed ran over to CNN with it but he waited he wrote this ridiculously\n... you know exaggerated article and then you really should take you know four or five days later people and I'm like the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we wanted ambushes and see if we can get him out of the white or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so\nWhat's your thoughts are if you went back and if you went and checked out the pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like\nYou were a guy who wasn't gonna pull any puncture just who's going to be very direct you're going to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with a retired minister Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that\nYou got suckered in a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happen to me but you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like do whatever you want to do we want to trust people\nHe ate Joe I made a mistake it's a vicious by first place down the area I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something do worse for Wall Street is literally the best person down there so while\nI Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is and so for me\nUh a lot of my book is also about that well that you know where I got up\nDusted myself off I was sort of like mayhem on the all the commercial coming through the car crash right and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because we never want to do is be on your back for too long yeah you don't want that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book\nI Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it as a kid writing it was really enjoyable for me to do a lot of research that\nThe headline news when Glenn Beck was off so I don't hate CNN I just know that they're not delivering the news and an unbiased fashion go ahead\nOkay I I have a four year degree in journalism and I think that Trump for example that are not ready for it right\nNow he didn't do that he didn't do that now that you bought hook line and sinker that you bought hook line and sinker you bought you bought a hook line and sinker Angela stop you can't be hurt if I'm speaking it doesn't work that way\nThat I did like I don't have to let you answer because your mate something up and you bought a deal with them you have you told you call back with call back with you for your journalism degree next time I read twenty eight awards for\nExcellence in journalism from the AP from Michigan association of broadcasters video arcade fee I Know the job CNN is purposely misleading people like you because it's effective it worked on you that's the problem\nSo look don't make this garbage job you want to believe CNN you wanna like what's going on us because you agree with them do

John I Bush a couple of things are important number one when you call do a radio show 'em you can't both be heard at the same time so you make an allegation then I Want to comment on it you got to stop for a second and then I'll let you can to you but the fact\nThat she wouldn't have stopped talking she thought that she would whether she kept talking unfortunately for you I have the microphone and I have control of of what's being heard at any given time I know I have a decision to make either both of us speak the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to your either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking\nUm it's not going to be both ways though I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue\nBut if you're gonna make allegation after about an allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to ... because there were there were a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true in fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... it was one of my focus just not true or the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very uh there are bad people on both sides there are very fine people on both sides\nThat if they were talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate a war heroes or soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments because they feel like they can and they really can't it's against the law first of all and second leads to debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay the return of history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yeah\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people and I said absolutely so he's been he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked a disabled reporter\nAlso ally yes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms where I I guess I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks as have stay like that the ... he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands in his in his forums as as most people do\nAnd the president went through I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know just spoken to in a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good it's good of you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are a ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even considering running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of a reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do the reporting till two veteran sixteen\nOr maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not sometimes he acts like a door that way the president and he does have that way and he speaks that way do look at me with Donald Trump um stupid or something you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant want it to hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and we're not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker with the fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong\nAnd don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide to know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you you may in fact at the end of the day no more than I Do but you failed any debate when you walk in picking your superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics were so bringing next time I get a little but you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate sharia\nOn this great great to be with\nYou I'm really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention it appears to be a plaintiff some short and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen at that jet is one of the famous jets set foot off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots uh when they came after our fleet at one point to Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on cut off the shelf and that really got him under control doesn't it\nWell what's interesting it was John Hi bushy use the executive director of the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute which is interesting to watch is thirty thirty five years later Ronald Reagan is praised by both sides and the media doesn't necessarily ever say anything negative about um\nThis guy I don't think a hundred years from now we're going to see anything good about them so it it's almost like a Reagan walked slowly carrying a big stick it out a big smile worst Trump just gets in your face used in in your opinion is that'd be the stark difference between the two because when you look at accomplishments like you said they're almost exactly the same\nYeah that's a that's a fascinating question you oppose because I I think about that every day I\nTrump is not such a bright white light you know the relationship so intense that I too cannot imagine twenty thirty forty years from now somehow that dates and media looking back you know it was the deer\nMentors or tourists not trauma threatened the national but also say during the ranking taste\nYou never thought it would have been imaginable either a you know\nUh they may not have that as soon as intensely war with each other not not at all but Reagan was the target of the liberal press every day he was an office there is no doubt about it and it's only really because of his remarkable successes but as you look back at him in his facts are facts\nAre stubborn things and and people not look at the Reagan presidency and they have to give a nod yeah what side of the fence that you might be on\nGuard reviews John Hi Bush executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute I'm I Wonder if you have an opinion on this and all of anybody's ask you this before but\nWhat was Ronald Reagan's um relationship with the media going in Donald Trump for forty years was a media darling in New York LA Washington everywhere they loved him because he met money they put him on\nPeople would watch the show and they put 'em on people would advertise on the show this yeah this relationship went downhill in a matter of three years that's all we're talking about here three years ago right before he announced he was still let me do you darling was Ronald\nReagan in good with the media before he ran or ... I I get the feeling that he was\nThey were actually he was a it was really hot yeah yeah you know I mean he got to remember Reagan started off as an outsider even with his own party they everyone many many thought he was way too far to the right so but at the end you have to remember to\nWant to wait before Reagan's first election he was down to Jimmy Carter by ten points you know it was not certain that he would when\nAnd when he came to office the press you know he was this is Amy of all done she was you know right wing not\nEverybody can learn about bedtime for bombs or whatever it might headline everywhere right\nAbsolutely and that you know they make fun of writing and say I can only speak if he was speaking off of three by five car and you know it wasn't smart it wasn't well read it was that was absolutely not the truth and I think as Reagan continue to perform\nIn like Trump succeed and achieve those goals uh they they they had to change their mind about Reagan I think by the time he got into a second term\nThey started to understanding what they had the front of them are already saw reading and for the success was but it really did take you know ... or one or two more presidency before the press really started to ...\nIt's kind of amazing or a last question and I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repairing this\nRelationship where do you see him going forward just doing exactly what worked so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's a failure is horrible news or something a foe been and there's something else but the bottom line is these crowds of a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see him doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if you walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing ... not going to happen and that's because\nIt's interesting it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision to go to war with the media but but now that the media has made the decision to go to war with Trump yeah\nThat's a very different thing I don't think the media and I I think they've kind of a na you know that kind of ... now and and now they're they're they're in an enemy camp and against him no matter what I don't think there's a truce that's on the horizon ever and I think that's going to be the case and so a\nSale Trump like Reagan hops aboard Marie once logical circle around the city\nI I agree with that I get is absolutely right it's a great introduction to we appreciate John Hi Bush or back after this over the weekend stare\nFixing or else for alerts and offers to be automatic text message Muscatine originally applying\nHello America this is Martha Stewart now you can cook great tasting dinners at home and it's easy to forget about frozen foods takeout instead during me for great home cooked food introducing Martha and release them Neal kids\nRepression fresh ingredients with my wonderful easy to follow recipes delivered break your door\nAnd right now you can try three for free for a very limited time I'm offering three free Martha ... eastern meals to everyone anywhere\nImagined cooking butter based at stake for sheer pork tenderloin key stuffed chicken and more with new recipes every week Martha ... helps you put a delicious dinner on your table and around thirty minutes\nFor three free meals and free shipping to young to two four six eight ten Jeff text word young to two four six eight Penn for details hurry three free won't last long taxed young to two four six eight ten\nCoast to coast\nLate night every night live on news radio one thousand Katie okay [noise]\nI drive us when we can with Joe package we have very little time but don't they don't leave you hanging you've got less than a minute do it\nCome on Doug you've got you've got like forty five seconds romantic drum up trying to leave you hanging let's go\nWhitewater new carpeting put in a candy bar and waiting oh well I Want her to go back to ensure Clinton's or or\nYou can be civil or anyone or any party was trying to destroy everything you work or right\nAnd that's perfect vote call Republicans unpatriotic Americans to get out and vote against a party and the people that are trying to destroy everything of America has the\nPoor and worked for for two hundred and forty two year Doug I Gotcha I appreciate you enjoy the rest of the Jimmy bark about Martin I called the guy with the kiddy bar in his mouth [laughter]\nCome on man it's like you and to show right there we got to get out of your average that you guys are hanging out at ...

appreciate you how are you\nA good joke thanks for having me on you know what what an incredible time we're living in right now want to get into the incredible succession the positivity\nThat came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI says was this idiot that sends out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what do you think yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history\nOf uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening to blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do you know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to greet how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a low on right let me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it and again it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms have these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e fighters advice early on and said you know some let's stop talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that um is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him the demography bomber the cold and you know for our good bomber ... ... people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a\nStandard shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I would say a Joe I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had to miss the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing ... do you want to take some ground there's the second I looked out\nThe was take them I now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about foreign minister head of the shootings so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for\nBut they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton you know urge incivility or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs\nI I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know I it is the the year where frankly President Trump or can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact that it's thirty five forty years later\nThe media looks back on a regular you know lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative than President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point but thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to redo that the economy for decades in in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to you again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair it'd be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... ... you worked on this night and day I remember you\nYour jaw I Want to come on but I only been up to minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American to pay taxes got a break every American who pays taxes has a bigger paychecks many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff here again or promising yes\nTo start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas are manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was

Islamic focus just not true of the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very uh there are bad people on both sides they are very fine people on both sides\nThat if they were talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate war heroes or soldiers or leaders\nThat's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments cause they feel like they can\nAnd they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yep\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people in that side absolutely so he's been he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and\nAnd the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on you actually believe that he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest\nThat he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled a reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms where I I guess I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks as have stay like that that he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands in his in his forms as as most people do\nAnd the president what I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know spoke at a at a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even consider running when he was a Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo is he ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do a report until two veteran sixteen\nOr maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not sometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he does is he is that way and he speaks that way do we'll give you a double trouble um stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets you're saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant to hand motion to do and if you ever done\nThat before and one not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker what's a fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong\nThey don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you you may in fact of being a little more than I Do but you failed but any debate when you walk in picking your superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level with anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you a straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics work so bring it next time I get to enjoy it but you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate jour you\nI'm just great to be with\nYou I Am really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention or it appears to be a plaintiff some shortness of beautiful flags waving the breeze ... what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen at that jet is one of the famous jets that flew off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots are when they came after our fleet at one point in Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on could offer you self and that really got him under control doesn't it\nGuard reviews John Hi Bush executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute I'm I Wonder if you have an opinion on this and all of anybody's ask you this before but\nWhat was Ronald Reagan's um relationship with the media going in Donald Trump for forty years was a media darling in New York LA Washington everywhere they loved him because he met money they put him on people would watch the show\nAnd they put 'em on people would advertise on the show this yeah this relationship went downhill in a matter of three years that's all we're talking about here three years ago right before he announced he was still let me do you darling was Ronald Reagan in good with the media before he ran or ... I I get the feeling that he was\nThe what actually wasn't it was really hot yeah yeah you know I mean he got to remember\nReagan started off as an outsider even with his own party ... many many thought he was way too far to the right so but at the end you have to remember to a one week before Reagan's first election he was down to Jimmy Carter by ten points you know it was not certain that he would when\nAnd when he came to office the press you know he was just a meal Don ... he was you know right wing not\nEverybody about bedtime bedtime for bombs that were made headline everywhere right\nAbsolutely and that you know they make fun of writing and say I can only speak if he was speaking off of three by five car and you know it wasn't smart it wasn't well read it was that was absolutely not the truth and I think as Reagan continue to perform\nIn like Trump sixtieth and achieve those goals uh they they ... they had to change their mind about Reagan I think\nBy the time he got into a second term\nThey started the understanding what they had the front of them are already saw reading and for the success was but it really did take you know ... or one or two more presidency before the press really started just ...\nIt's kind of amazing or a last question and I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repair this relationship where do you see him going forward just doing exactly what worked so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's a failure he was horrible and he says something ...\nAnd if something goes but the bottom line is these crowds of a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see him doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if you walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing hauling the press is not going to happen and and that's because it's interesting it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media but\nBut now that the media has made the decision to go to war with Trump yeah\nThat's a very different thing I don't think the media and I I think they've kind of a na you know that kind of ... now and and now they're they're they're in an enemy campaigned against him no matter what I don't think there's a truce that's on the horizon ever and I think that's going to be the case and so uh\nSo Trump like Reagan hops aboard

science behind what was this since ... science fiction story\nThat people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play\nBut it really is in many respects ... one of the first major big selling science fiction works and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like it was like a I robot\nBoth the ... version and then the robot that came before as most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation a and in fact in that very first\nVersion of I robot before the asthma version of a robot um the robot that is created in the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties so it sits down and read

have you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in in the implications\nOf the er the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important I mean we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nA ... that there are other places around the world outside the Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nI always try to tell people that film wasn't the first ever which wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are you know the first for trout America\nThe victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep it alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nThe honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed\nCountries are still being being executed for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course all the things on the planet\nThat have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one

we've been punted to find how fleeting a bumper on purpose it doesn't sound\nLike it would be Halloween bumper but it is for anybody who's seen the Netflix series the hunting of hill house [laughter] because that's been the theme they play a kind of a slowdown ... version of it in the promos let me tell you what a great show that was\nUm Stephen King praised it a ... it's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner ... deserves it just your great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book\nRight has very little to do with any of the other versions of the hunting appeal house that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions were these slightly changed the title\nA but it was it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but they just it's that good so if you're looking for something\nTo be a little bit spooky more in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting appeal house on Netflix um is is just one of the rare or the Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie is that\nThey they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it would almost scared me more than I could see it I I don't know if I could have handled it if I had seen it so stick look it up and

I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test and said yeah it was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get the best and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anyone\nI didn't write ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs to all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great work of a literature and place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know only oh America\nWhat's the uh ... and the population you said under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween or ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see that kind of bumped like that or is it just it's like it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some this is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff demanding restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their\nWhole start to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October\nWhich will never go well\nI Do it really is I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the tapes as open so I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but I but what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum so ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round to stay on roads and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are their rules a lake or curbs that they that are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it actually ... year round you any other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance they are the barrel grouchy the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town and fail and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting over on the people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar inside of a part of you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights\nOver start start heading the train and start having their cars so there that's really good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you to take some time so by midnight nobody around an aloe and\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad [laughter] you're not really that that\nReally got to get them up before the ... or maybe the two in the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list things do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list [laughter]\nThings are and have a great night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to Ross well in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that\nComing up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween of starting on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn coast to coast day I'm All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget the men from the train next on coast to coast am\nAnd now look back at this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen oh one sixty three year old schoolteacher named any medicine Taylor becomes the first person to take the plunge over Niagara Falls in a barrel with the help them to assistance Taylor strapped herself into a leather harness inside an old wouldn't Hitler barrel five feet high and three feet in diameter\nKnock violently from side to side by the Rapids and then propelled over the edge of horseshoe falls Taylor reached the short lived around twenty minutes after her journey began\nAfter a brief flurry of photo ops and speaking engagements Taylor's fame\nCool and she was unable to make the fortune for which had hope this week in Nineteen thirty one eight months ahead of schedule New York governor Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the George Washington bridge over the Hudson River\nFour thousand seven hundred and sixty foot long suspension bridge the longest in the world that the time connected Fort Lee New Jersey with Washington Heights in New York City\nOne year later it carry five million cars from New York and New Jersey and back again\nThis week in Nineteen sixty two in a televised speech of extraordinary gravity president John F. Kennedy announces a U.S spy planes have discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba\nKennedy announced that he was ordering an evil quarantine them Cuba to prevent so we'd shift transporting any more offensive weapons to the island was known as the Cuban missile crisis essentially ended on October\nTwenty eight when the Soviets announced they would dismantle and remove all weapons in Cuba\nAnd this week in twenty twelve Lance Armstrong is formerly stripped him seven Tour de France titles he won from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand five and banned for life from competitive cycling it was a dramatic\nFall from grace from the one time global cycling icon who inspired millions of people have to survive in cancer that's your look back at this week in history [noise]\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result\nIs a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in Seventy not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news riding that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public uh unnecessarily and at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press or there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail\nAnd Lynch somebody before trial just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train [noise]\nUh but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two\nWhere true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime\nBefore her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or to satisfies the details of somebody's death like a lot of these\nTrue crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham\nAnd not run for your life\nOr all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not wading into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about\nUp people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStave victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next on coast to coast am this is Ian puppet [noise]\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bonded with one atom of oxygen boom you're just created

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all their Claire geographic patterns and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curse just north of Portland\nThe fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve blood the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is they uh uh\nThe uh by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and break through his hadn't had had\nBeen achieved that had been done to make their way into courtrooms bought a it was it was a very slow process and it is a very infant tile stage\n[noise] men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer tracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out\nHad been a they had the Dodgers had human conduct connected then\nSo you you may have been the very first person that ever started putting this this case together in this way\nWell yes we were ... except for the end of the the\nThe the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was\nOn the loose from in Nineteen eleven a Nineteen\nTwelve which will runner and he was killing a lot of people but the earlier crimes we what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced\nTo have started this and Nineteen eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow we don't get noted walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got an as it nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year or so successfully\nNominal luck and it is not all ... ... I had told my daughter\nThat ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... and seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years honeybee out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would cover is track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we would just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with\nAgainst the uh with uh with with the last last murders and the series\nSo ah we ... it's just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a\nEvidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it\nBecause it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then excessively\nAfter that um it is is the years went forward and yet ...\nThere was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were sometimes there were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five\nThe ah I think that he while he use an ax to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something\nThat he would use if somebody was awake and could front of him but um it was not what he was trying to do but it's why he would do if you had to do\nTo get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do\n... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\nTheir general adds to the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of ourselves that we don't like to talk about a crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but they're they are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we covered them up\nCrime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader ... by the way the last book I read what the real crime but with the real world leader\nA it's a book by um [noise] that's why it's a A R rated Weinstein I could have a last name\nOr the uh I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry\nKnow there should be a it'd be it\nAnd and one of the things I've learned from reading that is the white America Walker who was a an avid reader crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader crime stories or a Henry Fielding it it's very common among writers to be avid reader Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because uh ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports I mean I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand that but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive thing\nIdling hang on to that thought on crime stories as this world pick it up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed and coast to coast am\nAdopt you asking presents multiple choice tanking\nYour daughter just had her for ... do you see yourself in her shoes\nHow could he

that\n[noise] you're fading out I was not able to hear a lot of them\nAre fading out no Kennedy that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day and writing crime at night\nThey were saying that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about\nThe man a crime I didn't make a go wherever it and thought oh entry into the subject I got hooked like a\nA I was I was a documentary about the murders and all those guys were called ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well done documentary him far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was my thing which is that it's relatively obvious\nThat the murders are a part of a serious so I started going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about fairies but the the our became\nA week the week of actually became five or six years I'm ... I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime book her yeah yeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day of somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution that we've tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed and why the community overall would benefit from his or her death\nAnd it became\nBecame an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought well heck this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions ... and then they would get passed around these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in the man from the tree and you're trying to bring it even though it's a hundred plus years leader in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that had happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On an exactly what happened to their town and how their town was\nBall do not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nThe um ... there was an interesting thing that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who uh was a\nA a ... his great great aunt had been\nWas one of the victims of the crime\nEngine and he had always believed that uh uh the man who uh\nWas accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released it always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book that in our book that uh um\nIt wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to it yeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a show he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was this other fellow I I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different\nBut uh it it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all books all good books or search for understanding and a lot of the\nBook is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these ... that these murders occurred in\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to\nMe but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was\nOne of the ... or what\nHow people lived that they they lived rich meaningful lie is\nA ... ... people in\nUrban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened to all of the things that happen to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they\nThey they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened to you happen to us happened to them\nUh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately\nIt is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they live or die terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town\nOr a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about\nThe atmosphere of the town for the um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed ... communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context\nI that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are and then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that illustrates the point you were just banking and that has to do with the the taco in the case of soccer with him then that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck oh\nWe had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nAnd Italian community um a\nPickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the tally in American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important in a crime story that is what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us do you think could lead to the ...\nIowa I'm and did the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching

not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then what there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nA ... or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also\nReally inform us as to how many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of family and what about is is that it was then and it is now but there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends

fireman so that you can spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment Kennedy thanks so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America well\n... that there is something odd about him the vet he he was not terribly young it was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nA his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that has ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity ... along so that you know the early patterns or not that tight but the\nLater patterns get closer and closer to the first crime\nIt's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that that's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr ... had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHad tiny widely spaced teeth\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look at that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that it in any sense of justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] and the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just an barking and come to the United states\nWell I don't know and you know there is speculation\nIn the book has a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you can have a speculative answer it's up to you\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before he killed the uh the Newt and family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there's an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much which respect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while you have if he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't but like a nice guy and he said he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried\nIt carried a banker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents through and about his life the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\n[noise] but it still isn't that's that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there had been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was a nurse and ours is is generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken\nTruly makes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear of over ... know norm at do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this the ... on the train is that from his crime that he was not\nEven not acting and fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with his for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first the story of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book\nAnd and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen and\nGoing to say well here's what that James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about ah this this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they are going\nTo do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity Filippo dawn in front of the book but various still more story to be discovered there\nYeah very interested in a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers you're coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also those Clinton minimum to\nEr and I made throw in a strange question about the Boston spring learned that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give me the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian\nSign up no go zone or free email newsletter get it today it's ... am done\n[noise]\n\nThere are a lot of kids in this country who didn't have a parent or their baseball games more recitals because their parents were serving in faraway places\nNow their parents are coming up\nI'm from battle some with wound you can see some with wound you can see like post traumatic stress disorder\nEvery day wounded warrior project assists wounded warriors and their families with the warriors to work program a program that helps warriors translate their military experience to civilian job experience and they help employers find the right warrior for the right job\nIs to be a total programming ... computers\nReally glad she's home 'cause I Can't even my dad's marshmallow like around ...\nI was to gather when ... when I was there for three and a brand new school and he's just a certainly\nIf you're looking for proven professional contacts wounded warrior project at find W.

about the man from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer Bill James is the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer\nA and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was tenor and blogger but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know it means like even today we don't think about those people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks\nAgo I got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence from a ... like one of the ...\nYeah I really watch any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the less murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and the has been the ... guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right uh you know what I'm Will Gary ...\nNo way down it disappeared ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be that he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured he might have worked out it got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but thank you for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThey give you that hey you know actually

being Halloween town\nAnd then I also part of that there are kind of kind of horror land right you go down the street of Salem you're going to see not just which is ... which cost and you're going to the Frankenstein monster and you're gonna see Harry Potter in Baltimore to you're going to see you know the Addams family all these guys there either by informing the actual street performers or as visitors\nUm to point that if you're a horror fan like horror movies than sailing you've got to kind of put that on your bucket list along with the no universal studios and some others in Hollywood those are the places you want to go to the\nUm horror movie side so it's become a mecca for that as well so it has all these facets the kind of tired of them are dark I guess the ... the common denominator but they're all different than their own way\nWe're talking with W ... a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts um and at the same time with you left the pirates right 'cause there's a there's a connection for private tears in ...\nI say all built on the maritime trade there were some of the first people in the ... in ... well not the country at the time before leaving the country who sent who've mapped out the Asian roots of trade like the first ever millionaire was a failing like because there were so good that trade overseas\nAnd of course that comes with pirates there's actually a pirate museum there and say on the line with the other stuff that you can kind of learn about you know they have similar stories to most of these coasts where all the kind of pirates had out here and there so they have a whole entire pirate chapter of their history as well which again is another kind of weird layer the story of film that have\nLike I said earlier like two dozen layers above just being the side of a trial and back and fixing to\nThe uh yeah and it it's not just a trial of course to rate is in the series but that those trials it was so fascinating to\nTo talk about it earlier this year in in for people who have\nCaused inside or you know back and listen to the show it was ... I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which ones\nWere originally let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test and said yep was really sorry about that then you go what are some of the people said no I'm not going to get better and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anyone\nI didn't write ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs to all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great work of a literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh in the population using under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the the Halloween or ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see that kind of bumped like that or is it\nJust is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days October\nOh math math I mean some of the some of his only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist and Paul not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff demanding restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their\nWhole started to pull a tourist and still happens the biggest one is October which\nWill never go well I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the states is open so I I I Would never have gotten their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but I think what the realizing is there's so many tourists coming to say on all over the course of a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round to stay on grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want to risk just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially like ... year round if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance they are the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century a graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic tables and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nThat do that there's there's on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people have the nights over ... start hitting the train and start having their cars so\nThere that's really lately and ten pm\n[noise] yeah I Believe it the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to shut it kept pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you to take some time so by midnight money around on Halloween\nIs ironic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad [laughter] really bad then\nThey got to get them up before the ... or maybe that's the real wishing happens after all the tourists plea GW locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and mayhem Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket

experiments that inspired Frankenstein so as you're heading into the holiday weekend a and getting up to a Halloween on the way a this is a it's a fun story to read because it it goes to show you the science behind what was this since ... science fiction story\nThat people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play\nBut it really is in many respects ... one of the first major big selling Science Diction works and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like ... it was like a I robot\nBoth the ... version and then the robot that came before as most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation a and in fact in the very first\nVersion of a robot before the ... version of a robot um the robot that is created\nIn the very first version of I robot which was in the Nineteen thirties so it sits down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding\nOf life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot com to a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they had recently uncovered but but if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in shape the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important that we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... and the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that are ... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that sell the first ever which wasn't the last one that was shot and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are you\nKnow the first for trout America the victim was in Connecticut in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries but\nWe don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep it alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which is killed\nThe honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being asked you for being what to do with the strange thing about that to me of course all the the the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet\nOnly one which city and that's still in Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween and the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the book to\nAnd then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either that's

because that's been the theme\nThey play is kind of a slowdown spooky version of it in the promos let me tell you what a great show that was um Stephen King praised at a ... it's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner ... deserves it just your great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book\nRight [laughter] there's very little to do with any of the other versions of the hunting appeal how's that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions where these slightly change the title\nA but it was just ... it was great but I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but uh\nIs it that good so if you're looking for something to be a little bit spooky more in the area of terror than horror very\nSuspenseful the hunting appeal house on Netflix um is is just one of the rare\nA Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie is that they they make a point\nTo do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... and ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it would almost scared me more than I could see and I I don't know if I go to handle it if I had seen it so stick a liquid that you're going
