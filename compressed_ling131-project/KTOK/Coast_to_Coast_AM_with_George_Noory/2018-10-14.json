we're extremely trusting as human beings well I'm going to go to your website and I'm going to be safe I mean that's\nObvious and re save not obvious\nIn fact we keep hearing about the breach is an open you're doing something about to protect yourself\n\nThe headline from NBC News so it could be fake news NBC News the same outlet that his pretending to president is holding Roberts Lee up on high while ignoring the fact that he talked um globally about Ulysses S grant beating oily\nBut it fits their narrative better to pretend like you said the part about lead\nSo NBC News fake news NBC says Facebook says hackers so personal info oh fourteen million people being exposed data including relationship status birth date hometown education and the Fifteen most recent churches Facebook said David Ingram wrote this\nFacebook set on friday that hackers were able to access to personal information of fourteen million people through security flaws of the company first disclosed last month and other data exposed in return for major such as raising chickens\nAnd searches so if you're not connected with me but you were able to hack into my account you know where I Am you know what I'm looking up in other words I have no privacy of his website\nIt all\nBack to the story Facebook sending a blog post that people would be able to check whether they were affected by the attack by visiting your Facebook help center on line the company also said that in the coming days it would send customized messages to users to explain what information might have an access\nThe social networking company disclosed two weeks ago that a security flaw in Facebook's view as feature\nHad allowed ... ended up potentially into and potentially take over people's profiles Facebook the world's largest social media network of more than two billion users has faced rising criticism that it's failed to protect people's privacy they disclosed this year that personal information of up to eighty seven million people\nWas taken by the maker of a quiz up and then wrongly handed over to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica Facebook did not say who might have been behind the leaves the jak or certain groups of people were targeted but it said it was working with the forties including the FBI to investigate\nThink about that you truly go to one of these Web sites and that's all Facebook is a freaking website some do first made up a website in college in the hopes of finding hot chicks on campus though Facebook is what they started getting rid of a judgment at Facebook\nThat you know blossomed into well yeah everybody wants to go meet hot guys and girls sure it would that we can share picture to Ellis is my family to connect to that and then it became\nA very powerful outlet it used to be that if you if you follow somebody you solve their stuff every time they follow Jewish all your stuff every time then they started employing something they call an algorithm\nThat they didn't make up a term obviously algorithms that around but they've got an algorithm that actually says\nI Know what you're looking at I Know would advertise you clicked on I Know who you most respond

what I don't want you to see and then it's I'm only going to send you the stuff we want you to see and now that we're floating around in a website that were started in trying to find hot chicks on campus now we have no idea whether we have any privacy at all\nI mean it's logical and rational to think I've connected with Martin on Facebook I should be able to see Martin stuff if you took the connection\nIf I'm not connected to him I shouldn't be able to see his stuff maybe as profile picture of your lets me maybe the fact that he has a profile that's fine but whatever he doesn't want me to see I shouldn't say\nThese hackers were able to go on there and see everything everything end in some instances we let me know how many really very able to take over the actual social media\nPresence that's next to me man that's crazy and still these stories are reported so infrequently\nWe have no idea what people are doing on Facebook and Twitter with our stuff we found out not long ago from project berets awesome James O'Keefe that Twitter actually has mushy language that will silence Jew if they don't like what you say\nOr they will read all of your direct messages because they feel like it and it's like a whole lot whole lotta nothing we can do about it it's so weird to me it just makes me a less trusting person\nWhat website can attract trust mind [noise] to dress the

Fox News President Trump in Richmond, Kentucky to host a GOP campaign rally where he announced his support for congressman Andy bar you also is adjusting the slogans slightly for running twenty twenty I\nNo I mean let's face it to her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and that's what they got that ... they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you want to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed to sway but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson resolutely right last question on Kavanaugh notable onto the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left is screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him I mean again it's ridiculous\nAnd I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their money for we're not going to kick him off the court 'cause we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and they they've been\nThey've had this primal screams cents a day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you\nKnow I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of hunting room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task growing hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage just administration from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican the great state of Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Garret who character you supported the president as it all Republicans and has been all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and\nAnd this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helps people of the major amount of people that were paying that find that tax the an Affordable Care act were middle class people\nThat were harmed horribly you guys did a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you were a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this is a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care plan and keep it ya\nFamilies who have their previous reduce probably five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside to be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing can be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer every new ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and again they're just estimates and in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mom and care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks year you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if you could afford them and of course a seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you said a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that for me center if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of coverage for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do through regulation right so the ... the protection in terms of pre existing conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were\nJust giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they'd been priced out of the bond care exchanges we're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford\nHealth insurance for once okay no this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when when the ...\nUnion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because they want single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects aren't preexisting condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nUh they think they can win the election but no I mean there are long term goal obviously is Bernie Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts a tour his single payer\nGovernment run bureaucratic system that will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business taxes at least double and it's still wouldn't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching to write down the number thirty two trillion then realized how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime I ... um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned briefly I feel strongly that knowing that the Senate\nWould you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly but the houses are starting to look like

I mean to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable Doug of a I heard today somebody may mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... tank and he's ... he didn't work all the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational thing to politically people can make this happen\nI that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you are right except for these things go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments are emerging that associates so as\nWe watch this you know Obama when he was an officer and talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look I've read I Am I'm\nThis of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst in for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big for its bridges\nYeah no I I think so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fat some the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nHad been very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really\nProfound to thanks [noise] first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in in income or into a household and then what goes out for ... like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay we're at the lowest level the percentage of income go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better salesman they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat\nThan they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash\nExported and we're actually exporting no more than we're importing had a great question from a call yesterday who said if we're we've got all this oil we keep on exporting it will just keep it\nRefunded ourselves and I know that it's a it's a global market that's why but maybe you can break down exactly how that works next I'm going to do that yeah you bet that's easy\nTo appreciate Doug Adler he's again of the managing\nDirector and also the senior vice president of investments over imaging to associate so we started dug and half or more than Twenty years now when it comes to stuff like we saw happening when the stock market this past week and great information is always one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com stay writer news\nMessaging ... earning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and giving you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur some thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just had an outline did incredibly this president said I'm not giving in this justice Kavanaugh decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and\nPull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House a lot of people especially the press department said I I Am it's a strange one why\nBecause I refused I just refused flat out from day one to talk to the the fake news I I ...

the good there we've redesigned the website Go check it out also\nThe blaze radio network it is the weekend with Joe ... have you you're always glad to catch up with my former governor the former governor of the great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well what the heck does that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about ... we're talking about liquefied natural gas we get into an war as well uh ... appreciate you how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much where I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know Texas but it's a it's what I called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I I can see their travel on Facebook\nAnd on Twitter and so on you or your or a globetrotters now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia we did you know that that was going to entail all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution a run his off that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we are now\nSelling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent as groups and\nUh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as\nA as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American\nEnergy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIs the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining ... putting terms is going to ruin trade\nAnd in no time flat biggie you stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade them in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the bill how does that go down\nThat have he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury\nMinutiae and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross gay all have a a a role to play in that and and so absolutely there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth and uh every everybody's on the same team\nI Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know\n... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes and what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade you and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a young and came back in here uh after they laid out some really tough ah a sanction or not sanctions but ...\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose\nA they know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want to stay in our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nAny good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming onto the great guidance of a\nGreat job it now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got\nTo see what these trade deals were especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little bigot everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it as these things are outdated you know think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two running side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are still a developing at the energy sources that we were buying\nAnd now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada boat\nVery different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president would say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh U.

Lee up on high while ignoring the fact that he talked um globally about Ulysses Grant beating lead\nBut it fits their narrative better to pretend like you said the part about lead\nSo NBC News fake news NBC says Facebook says hackers so personal info oh fourteen million people these supposed data including relationship status birth date hometown education and the Fifteen most recent searches Facebook said\nDavid Ingram wrote this\nFacebook set on friday that hackers were able to access to personal information of forty million people through security flaws of the company first disclosed last month and other data exposed and good information such as raising chickens and searches\nSo if you're not connected with me but you were able to hack into my account you know where I Am you know what I'm looking up in other words I have no privacy of his website it all\nBack to the story Facebook sending a blog post that people would be able to check whether they were affected by the attack by visiting your Facebook help center on line the company also said that in the coming days it would send customized messages to users to explain what information might have been access\nTo social networking company disclosed two weeks ago that a security flaw in Facebook's view as feature had allowed ... ended up potentially into and potentially take over people's profiles Facebook the world's largest social media network of more than two billion users has faced rising criticism that it's failed to protect people's privacy\nAnd disclosed this year that personal information of up to eighty seven million people\nWas taken by the maker of a quiz up\nAnd then wrongly handed over to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica\nFacebook did not say who might have been behind the latest attack or certain groups of people were targeted but it said it was working with the forties including the FBI to investigate\nThinking about that you truly go to one of these Web sites and that's all Facebook is a freaking website\nSome do first made up a website in college in the hopes of finding hot chicks on campus though Facebook is what they started getting rid of a judgment at Facebook\nThat you know blossomed into well yeah everybody wants to go meet hot guys and girls sure what the hell are you\nSure picture to Ellis is going to be able to connect to that and then it became a very

no idea whether we have any privacy at all\nI mean it's logical and rational to think I've connected with\nMartin on Facebook I should be able to see Martin stuff if you took the connection if I'm not connected to him I shouldn't be able to see his stuff maybe as profile picture of your lets me maybe the fact that he has a profile but it's fine but whatever he doesn't want me to see I shouldn't

next to me man that's crazy and\nStill be stories and reporting so infrequently\nWe have no idea what people are doing on Facebook and Twitter with our stuff we found out not long ago from project

once the name is out there instead of the Feinstein teams saying let's get you some help and let's get a psychiatry psychologist to talk you through this figure out what happened she instead says here's a far left wing resist lawyer and this lady Deborah cats go and talk to her I mean I I don't think that's the right move either were you on that\nNow I mean let's face it to her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle\nOf her and Brett Kavanaugh and that so they got they they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you ought to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed is way but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a center on John seriously right last question on Kavanaugh known them onto the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left the screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him I mean again it's ridiculous\nAnd I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their Montreal we're not going to kick them off the court because we're so unhappy that he's on the court well\nThey're an angry mob and they they've been\nThey've had this primal screams since the day after the election when the wrong person corner them one you\nKnow I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous insecure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this ministry from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican the great state of Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Gary ... used supported the president as that all Republicans and I was that all Americans 'cause their paychecks are bigger and\nAnd do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually help the people of the major amount of people that were paying that find that taxing the an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys it a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a a political thing just strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you like health care plan and keep your families who have their premiums reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they they are pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or a bomb you and then in addition to that allow companies to offer me new ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get in there just estimates in Wisconsin for example health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mama care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year or they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I didn't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guarantee remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if he can afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you said it's not going to go and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions are untouched nobody is saying those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that for the center of you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection terms or preexisting conditions you could always go on the Obamacare exchanges were\nJust giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the care exchanges we're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford\nHealth insurance for once okay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because Romney one single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base is that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protection preexisting condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nOr they think they can win the election but no I mean they're long term goal obviously is Bernie ... Sanders your Medicare for all which just which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts it tore his single payer\nGovernment run bureaucratic system that will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right there by the way that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs for like thirty eight trillion dollars every buddies individual income tax at least have to double business taxes at least double still won't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching the right down to number thirty two trillion\nThen realize how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson a one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime my friend um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned briefly\nI feel strongly that the ... they would you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly but the house is starting to look like it's up for grabs were this blue wave was being talked about for six months\nDo you think that the moves by ... Feinstein and and uh and Cory bookers barbecues and all these people in that process\nWhere do you think that's going to motivate conservatives and Republicans to get up off their hands and go and

all white they're also the live video stream you use the weekend with Joe packs led to have\nYou long for the ride so talking about a ride the stock market as we took a bumpy ride some say a roller coaster some say just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever it's opening markets thing or potential question I always go to my friend Doug Adler use the manager director and senior vice president of investments ruby dreams that associates a Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJoe I'm great thank you so all the president has to say that the fed is logo\nAnd that when we get eleven hundred points it due to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know be I think we stock market as a slot machine anyway so but I don't really worry about my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about it can you point to one thing that made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of things Joe it what's always interesting about the market is\nThings that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrug it off drugs it off and then suddenly it it it matters I think what's kinda manifested here as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough a a photo if you will in in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies are pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil is gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything toward Seventy but still that's much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that you know those of all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell button\nDo do you have a video ... managing director senior vice president over the river dreams that associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state inflation\nTarget of two percent going here and then when you start to she mentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy as much stronger than it was when President Trump took office right you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah\nThey want to just right and so they're trying to do that meaning a slow

Institute in Virginia and William cells as they set aside he and he guide you\nThrough these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that they exist from my experience in love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the shadow thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you still and have a good side he'll\nTell me first of all what led you to even create such as this tendency I out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd I was not a believer in this be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored um and for\nIt took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience\nAnd it was it was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your ... your tire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is now you had your out of body experience with self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise uh that I that\nI learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nAnd was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but\nThe first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room a going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm out\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself\n... ... that said I think\nIs the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience them in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is\nNot the sort of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is then at the ... of the universe\nJust one of them yeah yes and\nBut you can experience at first and and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the pistons information's in the in ... why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human\nAnd it has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because especially they feel real you know he was playing because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined what an entertainment is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity\nExperience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nIs no um when I teach my classes I there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your classes you teach at them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism many [laughter] ... it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great invention only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in check

them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber and then I present\nPeople that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its functions in different names and different cultures\nBut nothing that I went to ... we\nWe presented in I\nThink I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in\nA very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious

percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness\nTo your non physical body because you're having it doesn't mean you've accident your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that's I ... on because that happened if I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now the ... you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many\nOther um experiences have seen unexplored every one when they sleep we all humans are moving out of face from our body sets with sleep is mhm\nWe take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during\nAn out of body experience losing ... image you're looking at\n[laughter] it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream began or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ... bc\nTemporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess for play ... and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game\nBut very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between that and imagination\n... that's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience or and and you can have multiple experiences\nFor instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences\nWhere I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get\nInformation given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOf what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or ... anyone other than yourself\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important yes\nBecause all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say\nEducational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left backed up special your religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience that menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of the first Adam ... hearing aids which means for ... years old that people recline recount painting and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that you don't get sucked into that stuff but you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer on of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that we\nEat out any ridiculous and you realize it's\nYou know there's so much of a court and stuff that we need to know about ourselves the\nGreatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self\n... that's the core issue\nInvolved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge of self if every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke one day and I knew what we were and where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'll be no wars are being ... no ... none of that\nWould occur ... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you do see experience if your fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a close look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative energy if if there is not like there's negative entered its you were going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that as well\nWell you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and\nYou have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had lived one once where I went it was a dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\n... owns a motorcycle and\nHe was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection of anything and it was the name was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension which\nLooks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we can't each other yeah and I don't know is that an added well out of body travel most likely\nMhm well it could have been\nIt wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about a consensus realities are created by a collective\nGroup of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist in in a multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start them learn nice what is essentially the rules a non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWere used a linear time right in the gravity we're used to air yeah when when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my workshops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they well thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which is an astral info dot org you'll find out about all of this book and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well\nAnd when we come back we're going to attack about since Colorado and some of the great history but the forgotten town that's Colorado Sylvie back I only see you're listening to ... am\nInto a fashions requiring mission to study at the academy for four years and to train aboard shift each summer the basic format that remains at the academy to this day this week in Nineteen sixty eight Apollo standing in the first manned Apollo mission\nWhen it happens\nIt happens here news radio one thousand Katie okay [noise]\n\n\n\nWell welcome back to the coast to coast am so Mike yesterday her website it's called managed to legends dot com and I love the beginning of it it does [laughter] welcome to the blue moon hunted history chores Ruben probably scaring the public's since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie\nLisa I'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the ... out of it was lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercials they can you really saved pianist commercials is is that there's a sharing anyway let's go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but what do what is your first experience with her normal\nWell this I've been seeing go since I was me an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say I'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and unite the paranormal can even immunity and also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirit out of Longmont, Colorado\nMhm and so\nThe two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name the spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and leave we call it a little faith because every year we try to sponsor it in a different community\nAnd by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the night supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that what I decided to do\nAnd interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to shift for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book ghosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the shipper publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through you're going to thyroid cancer and how you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that\nI like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWhat do you mean seeing it you've you've I see it and I actually feel it\nI ... like image to examples that\nI can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny that I can actually sense things [noise] um I met him path I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I hadn't\nVery ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun and kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California is a time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and your she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it\nWas really rundown\n[laughter] extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans\nAnd said that we would pass the house in five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you well after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter] yeah\nSo I actually called the owner's son\nAnd he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this is before she died and then he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like\nWow I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you know things will allow Lou ... everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter]\nI Can't wait till the ghost\nOf Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom must be on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named\nI knew I wanted to do with the Joneses friends so young\nStep mom's go turn [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally\n[laughter] oh it has to be validated you\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in ... springs right tell us a little of the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right\nYeah oh well this was his home base he used to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know\nWhere we live in Little Rock he's ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the\nMan he was fascinated with managing springs especially because we had some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter ... springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my ... will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not\nThe the end of the American Native Americans knew about these sacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways I'm just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck\nWill go up and um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that because of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas\nTesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it will be he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like\nDiving into buildings and in like ... pilots [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out

blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were just talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nUm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight them and they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nShe'll be manager confirmed that\nSnow yes all of this worked up beautifully [laughter]\nThan eating now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing during the time the fourth book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team\nBecause the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nIn this book was reaching out for at least trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes you seem to be the you like the public is for the east coast today [laughter]\nYou I think that is the main thing is it's meant to be one you have a wave really connecting history with you you do the research is like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goes the likes of the little girl that bounce the ball isn't she do I'm like no leave in ... ... and friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited no\nNo that's not if they are they're just kicking you being a trick to improve\nTheir it's here they are in prison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the ... and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not\nAnd everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know there we do have the votes that come out at midnight you know Tom or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for if he wants to see them with your eye\nIs at the in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night ... ... that is the best time\nIs a transition time why\nIf the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes the judge it makes perhaps when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast rate and it\nI call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and then the Rockies we had a beautiful because of the way that bounces off the rocks and that led to the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now hunted or did you met with non ... and the gas the ghost follow you\nRight they do on like two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding\n[laughter] but um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managers who were on a timer because whenever I was walking her name's bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend said well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very hunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah you have to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the uh did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh\nHave you tried to say it's happening it won't so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic tricks I'm really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there other other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's the essence\nPart right there oh yeah you know this family hotel right there on that a native ... very sacred Native American land and vulgar right there it seems to be a a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even as to part with ... with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up light up with the red energy\nI find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains this very sacred land it's very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine as you were right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of a war of the pikes peak they believe was the naval of the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\n[noise] you know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very fatty Ernie I Love that stuff [laughter] you know hikes peak gets very popular and it has a lot\nOf um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it and um we're going to take a break in just a minute maybe you can tell us a little bit about

T.\nV. a ... or ... I think that's what the native youths used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nOne why are we going to call that connected to the mother okay yeah it's connected\nTo the mother and think about the native is the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThere and the natives knew that if the of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHere and cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw UFO when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon was cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships and they were hovering just about oh a hundred\nHundred yards with other than it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because even today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone exactly\nExactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm erratic flight plan or exactly up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter ...\nA fascinating and they didn't know what to they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not\nThere weren't a lot of people around yeah but a lot of people saw this I mean just outrageously crazy and he followed his story in Kansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing and the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly know when farmers in Colorado are saying that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there are two hundred or a\nA UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal conventions and one of my friends is named Dan ... and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot or come to his back door opened his door actually um [noise]\nHe um the big foot actually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some big hair [laughter] and um then has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal\nAnd he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick lessen the rocks and I've been back there with him and so all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot of you might not\nHave you seen in the writing\nA he believes that my friend he only if it's um they you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believes that his property is a poor hole\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider the possibility that\nMay be big foot is a missing link maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm mainly seen something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell Jimmy ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about this uh these stories and goes and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher because that's what I mean I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking under the right name of course the Native Americans wouldn't have called this creature Bigfoot now would say [laughter]\nI wouldn't have gone Chinese would know\nThat there was a hundred and fifty four different names by the Native American Indians depending on\nWhere they lived in the Rockies where they relocated a hundred and fifty four different names that's why we had a communication problem here I mean I can think of a few names right off the hand but I mean that's why I'm doing research on this was so fascinating it open so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story makes sense\nYou know if all of a thing being once we decide on a name you know sasquatch I think most big foot tall it likes to call it um you know that is just a name that it's been come up within the last few years I mean relatively speaking maybe fifty years I don't know\nI yeah I I'm but I my question more it's more about the hotter the Native Americans feel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the men issue springs area and garden of the guards in the areas near pikes peak\nWell that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true now I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had some\nThe American advertising federation presents at

I ... out of body ventured idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer\nBut I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise uh that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a hit in the ...\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hypnotic therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your hope he will get you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night\nAnd the next after a series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side note I when I become aware I realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I ...\nMy arm entered the wall and when I ...\nYou reach the arm out\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that\nWas my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body ... guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit\nShocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here and a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally paying the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one and then yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience that first

and this is in ... you had already been teaching about this war\nYes yeah so um I was familiar with it but most out of body experience to just be clear or or spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a fleet paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps you face that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as cars science has been part of that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and there were no I'm all over\nOr their vibrating or there are hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to these travels the experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese\nBut they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the mind\nOf their mind mirror is just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In a ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that's you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it\nMy main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have\nThe literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional fell right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's ... into a restaurant in southern dot org and there are great resources on there\nAnd I and I found this isn't the ways that you can take yourself into and it will be in there and you want to

I didn't realize it was that you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that\nWas my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... you need that said I think\nIs the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that's around as you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience I'm In other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not\nThe sort of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize\nThat the physical world is just the innocence up at ... at the ... of the universe\nOne of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and\nYou know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all of the system's information the dean dean why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any
