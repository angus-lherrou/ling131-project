the uh ever take care of the study of America let that go on for months\nAnd they disbanded that finally got the best of the police chief [noise] um [noise] some of them moved to city hall and you may

contracts in this case it is over a\nCivilian and that was shot by police officer\nResponding to another shooting so they've taken the intersection for going on two weeks now at a believer ... pedophile pedophile being Harvey Milk they've decided to rename the street and um they've been there for two weeks now and it's time to let the city habits street back it's ridiculous\nHow is it possible that a few dozen antifa protesters can take over an intersection in the downtown area of the city for you're telling me weeks and the police do nothing about it\nBasically for the most part they let them know bell dog jaw they're talking about and then they decided to grow up at the end of a workday I don't know what the what what what the motivation is they just pick and choose what they want to do something\nAs a covered in the news or people angry about what's going on\nIn a cover the the uh the left slant to appear unfortunately we don't really have a non biased news network\nSo you don't have television condemning this kind of misbehavior they cover it is if they have a valid point\nOut of our local conservative talk show radio host up here in in Portland no we don't have a voice saying otherwise\nWell it does is Portland to conceal carry steak can you have your own weapon yes isn't it somewhat\nRisk either be pulling people out of cars and stopping them and

warning residents at the panhandle to be preparing to\nWhich group of both liberals and conservatives in this country than are borderline psychotic and they resorted to screaming and climbed up the doors like animals or better yet like zombies trying to get into government buildings is verdicts reading confirmations or voted upon\nSomebody called me and said was disingenuous receipt of conservatives are doing it well no not really yes liberals are doing it more so we're seeing more of the liberals doing it because of the unpopular votes and the unpopular choices that they don't particularly liked and yet they are going psychotic\nBut there are some that are responding butter justice psychotic vi V. are those are the right there responding so yes everyone is driving a nail into the cockpit of America\nMore so one side to the other teams actions that we're ... we're basically motivated by sure emotionally now been motivated by fearless rage it's beyond most you know it's all about right and this is getting dangerous why that would be prudent to tell people\nThat perhaps it's time to heal and choose our battles no one will listen because there are been debt is to be settled in revenge is a dish but his best serve cold in America\nSo whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never\nGet that bad quiet and then I fear mongering for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\nBut it's certainly cynics bitter theory in order to keep telling yourself that America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed and living\nThrough a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and it is a real experience that I talked about that in the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern day at a modern city modern needs to be like when I ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine the United states the civil war would be similar\nExcept that we have the Internet that's the difference say I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different\nTo the normal news cycle regularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and would they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or direct you to Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it certainly set the ball rolling because it's\nIt was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that the members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attacks happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks Seattle we have the rights that attack that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nTalked about the Russian each cult an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if the responses overwhelming and police department's going to keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent\nAnd the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either be the military working within already militarized police\nOr the police working against the military there also be restrained to start with how or if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I\nDon't know if there will go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\nAnd the reason why we think this\nIs because we live back in history and we all know that it was the union believed to be into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now but if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\n\nLike Republican against Democrat conserve against liberal no on how it's going to be that's not what a civil war will be in the United states if this happens no it's not modern civil war would have many so called sight seeing\nThe dirty war of South America there were several sides that we're fighting there were the parent is kind of nice there's the radical ... the communist common east of the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews sewn into the police the moderate de la ... I can go down all the list of who are fighting against to\n\nThe age group would have their own band of terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture of course the government had access to the police they had access to corrupt cops had access to ... military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well your poll by the way was part of that group\nFeeding America we didn't have a left wing group incite violence or insurgency that which marker response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be an anti ... because they're usually the ones that carry out all this stuff\n\nThis stuff hits the fan\n[noise] over the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick Kimmons there was a black man\nWho was shot by police afterwards members of anti five blocks streets directed traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police looked on and allow the harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAn elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti ... what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob where they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police looked on\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made the right hand turn instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car and the other surrounding the demand was out numbered probably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing wrong\nAnd it could have wound up\nWith him being beaten shot once again the police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nI had about three thousand dollars worth of damage done to his car\n\nOnce again of a civil war breaks out there that are here or in the United states would not be two sides fighting\nWe can see hundreds of sides with hundreds of agendas yearning and fighting for independence\nTheir separatist groups that America militia groups keeper storm front patriot prayer Proud Boys Christian sects Muslim groups all these guys could come together and feel the flames for civil war others are just the\nKennedys could be criminal gangs I give them is Thirteen black nationalist groups white nationalist sovereign citizens generally any armed organized group with some kind of history to it now with the Internet\n\nWe would see more organized insurgency through social networking\n\nIs anybody remembers the purge threat August fifteenth twenty four team the mainstream news was reported\nOn the events

how it's done and that's not how it's going to be done on how civil wars are fought now people have to go to work people have to bring home food\nI mean does it neglected is being should rich missing

it hasn't been declared we can say that it isn't happening here right well it is happening here\n\nThe civil war we're now in ... actually can be identified as a patchwork of affiliated insurgency groups and their counterparts engage again light skirmishes along the overlapping edges of their networks mix with occasional high value terrorist attacks\nAgainst soft and hard targets targets and

everything we have an opinion about everything but it doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identify the war you're not going to identify it during

security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus sitcoms let's\nCheck in with our expert on the Internet Lauren Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus for him so hopeless\nIs is a Google a social networking platform as it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise]\nUm there's going to be missed what it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it\nReally in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy Facebook\nSo there was no separate income stream and coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people to come to regret it given what's been going on\nBut sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now\nThis brief that occurred ... of the right at the top of the currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise] apparently\nThere is that they really didn't is they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school and the kinds of information that were that were\nTheoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that while the stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why they're petition and they cut us out on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but by the it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting a demotion the setting of Google Plus over a period of about\nA month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and uh it would've been a lot better off if they had in the meantime all of us\nWho've with using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go or experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial version of Google ... which operates further Gees we the the the businesses where you pay about five bucks a month or per head\nUsing of that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially [noise] uh and\nThen we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably ... ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place that's a time\nAt ... at the end at the time it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that

thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing beyond space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nAll right with the out the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests no would science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggests that there is a consciousness existing independently functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talked about near death experiences\nAnd if you'd asked me a few years ago wasn't near death experience I Would if that isn't that just to help the nation that happens when someone about to die like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple\nUh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person it out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that it suggested a some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you it's coast to coast am dot

some\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think at like hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the ... cycle ... says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\n[noise] years ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in present meant experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true\nAnd I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that\nMatter the classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out zeroes and ones in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty present zeros and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once heroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd and people do people have that ability going up\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project was which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around event that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically in a ... at a single moment\nThat we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened\nBefore the plane hit the towers before the\nYeah before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr in jail or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor ... she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say doll which trickery its magic but the the if you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\n[noise] [noise] well I've heard of of food and bending party which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending metal for example and ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller than\nThere are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gallery very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending it's in the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say in the direct quotes from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of Keller success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability and convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo yeah there has been a lot of debate about him but the documents suggest that studies were around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that down totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people can get your book\nShore my website is my name mark over and they are gay G.

but it is going to be a powerful storm either way likely making landfall we're looking at it and maybe new into one o'clock timeframe still a little bit of time for this to move a little bit but thank lunchtime early afternoon when landfall will be going into a really become a reality Fox\nBack Marc over with us and we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up to ... this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was an Asian perhaps it gets into a window into a reality that we typically don't even our eyes I I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have their in cardiac arrest resuscitated and the experimenter is talk to them soon after they're able to soon after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for example Dr ... a party at from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest come back and described that's near death experience and why is that significant\nIn cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma and medicate the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is from doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience ...\nWhere he heard something in the room it was later found to be the difficulty later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamp and we know when that hit her later went off and it made it very distinct it's down\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the\nAttending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experienced and memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWho's looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark ... six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets the theory\nYou can't see those radio signals what's out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us\nAt our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up enough to get a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientists you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot damage\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist anti materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and these\nAh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious as goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing you ... you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically a I liked it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about psych medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded pins in X her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nBack chemically the brain and their work they do affect chemical you the consciousness meaning of the mind so by changing biologically biochemical leave the brain through these medications or even an aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches\nGoing back to psych ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious of the minds of those things that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine in the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation\nIn other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness you damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience\nIt's not the producer of consciousness when\nWhat do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UCA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks for physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life yes and in some cases the medical records are found\nSo it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical\nSomething else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another often simply\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm On the go ahead\nGeorge and

had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on doubting with water which\nIn yes okay I've seen it work the at work and then seeing the drillers calm and drill right to that same to adapt\nAnd there it is ... and ... you\nKnow again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that there's something there that we don't fully understand\nAnd then can we say that it's the dolls or the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow is er and I've seen it with three different methods brass Raj wheeler sticks and tendons\nOver a map mhm okay I'll watch Penn over a map which was the most strangest one of all that somebody could could could find water and yet there it is up comes to water [laughter]\nSo are is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the electromagnetic flocks in the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties who knows\nWhat she has a scientist we need to we in science cannot ignored cannot ignore going all the way back\nYour your your guest mentioned William James\nOkay all that whole period when all of this a lot of this early early research started\nInto shall we say five ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I I've never seen a U.S I've ever seen what I could call a UFO nice guy and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw it when I never did before but I saw\nYou know so I can I can put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the rain\nComes within\nWithin just now maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling yeah\nThey can feel it it's a it's they're reading comic but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal of pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things steam and just said we're on her way using it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough\nAnd that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field a physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nSo there are things in the ... the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically this has opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right

she can remember\nShe is communicated with the D.C sit at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which obsessed with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practice studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more he has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on coast to coast Maureen welcome\nA thank you so much for having me we could afford to this fine uh Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful\nWoman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is salmon and feel often when I was younger I\nSee her walking around town you know dressed and her her garb and very regal looking very um you know she's a big prize on a person and ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms you did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but let's just say the town in Salem not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those\nDays it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed the whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right\nFor the type of these and then it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said the civility what year are who did it start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought the girls insane [laughter]\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I mean it was normal I did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother wouldn't just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just that you know she'd come my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that if you don't want Marlene ... from my\nFamily for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and you're waiting for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so\nIt's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by and my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the others that you could carry through\n\nNow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and ah I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting\n'cause she had a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy\nOn and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know ... that was her truth out she was very unique that what you said so the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about the earth anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England new ghost project Maureen since two thousand one what is that\nA well rounded doing much better than me to tell the story but he has that story\nAfter and uh near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special court a class that he took\nTo try to keep them busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically have started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that came up program he had to do it on something so he chose you know feeling on go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining and I would focus\nBut it's a team of individuals that you know over the years\nI learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get a you go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee one look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown all you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation some people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house and then just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as\nAs it says we've done more than a hundred investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nMore than you conclude about what this may be or make a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes jar what do you think they are\n\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them\nUm we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have\nSomething go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice\nOh I see it as much as you probably try to try to stay focused ... you know you get involved in these things\nYou do definitely down you can put yourself in their place and and realized that you know our own you know mortality right so it\nCan you come face to face with dealing with that on many occasions if it could be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest case you've come across strangers skittish\nStranger case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times and just about all the time you would never tell me where we were going on because they keep me honest right so I'm not Googling\nLine that information eager for\n'em to one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case it's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take an hour\nYou know ha ha ha ha so yeah exactly I'm sure I'm sure are on\nYou know he's very creative right so I said\nOh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to the home it's just you know little ranch style house and we we get there and if that's meant to guys there wanted they just wouldn't really rough and tumble you know and this one guy you know like run I think his name was moose and the\nBig big guy covered in tattoos and we just try to you know just\nOverwhelming right sit there and so why is just looking at me and we get in the house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mayor is shattered glass table from busted and it just looked like something went through the house with a bat\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know my phone's been ringing with all the Arabs on it and my wallet went missing and now he's telling me all these things and he kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up\nSo after a few minutes and thinking oh dear God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this isn't meant no it's not and he was getting adamant that you know it wasn't and I talked to\nUse and brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right I'm elite Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any rags me down on the on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself\nAnd I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl you got to be careful\nYou know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know it's there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she and he said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want\nTo hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary hey we'll be back in the moment with more on coast to coast than\nThis audio is for your review and now for broadcast Internet posting or distribution to

know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr ... or did\nNot find is that by the leaving me\nAnd I first book uh goes chronicles is ... is the second book on the series a marine and I didn't investigation was daytime investigations jumped him and called me up and asked me to check out his house so I gather ... we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it has been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... ah and ah they kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and\nAh one of them move separated me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that\nThat the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and ah so he won in marina comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fair was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's\nIt's one that's left an impression with us\nI think so what kind of equipment do you bring with you\nA very on on on the particular case uh the you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more pieces of equipment or\nThe smaller case the lesser amount but you always want to um you know tried to ah bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance if you have reports\nOf a ... be unseen you might\nBring more video equipment are and you're like thermal or I or whatever that you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and I was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies according according to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nThat I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that they weren't really well I was ... times in the world while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nWork with a a lot of White Houses or a funds for him and we do you know public go sons and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On board of directors of course on top of a White House that we do these haunted toys and one time we were in this um [noise]\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you and say is windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and those who want to do it in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them I'm doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on ...\nThe outside towards the door and she got about halfway down the side of the ... you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself as she came in and they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for like a surrogate generally walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I it's her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat the vocation is where the coast guard because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard records in women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing I'm\nA ... the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public a ghost town on a ... light host and a bit pool meal main we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was\nUnder\nRenovation at that time it was sitting at a picnic table in the in the room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen and I saw a dog will crush the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the the there was no\nIt was founded outside jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman and she says right would you see that's just that's our dog she says describe much sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe that she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know run there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved them leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so I Would like housekeepers afterward took care of them till the dog actually died and I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much matches\nBecause she has a dog that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean is two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it's certainly saw it would appear to me at the upper Russia\nWhen it's still hangs
