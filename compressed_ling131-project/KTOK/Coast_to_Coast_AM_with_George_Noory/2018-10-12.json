Soviet Russia Mao's China and as I've talked about many times the Argentine dirty war\nSo what if something happened that we treated small uprising or a big surprise me and that uprising turned into full on civil war\nI keep in mind that insurrection combative and revolutionary events history had small skirmishes before the big ones that are up to ... and this is why now\nWe should take a page from history and understand that we're about to witness the return\nOf what would be called the mob or the mob rule or the vigilante justice or perhaps even something a lot worse and the reason why I said this is because of the fact that a\nCouple of nights ago I did a show called new in New justice no peace and ah I attempted to point out that the traditional way we think of civil war in this country is crowding the fact\nThat we're already in one end while no one will attribute school shootings to beat the gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of civil war and progress our leaders both left and right acknowledged that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the after the November election\nPresident Trump warned that there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections and he stated that the rights of the American people were under threat from violent people\nI'm sure he mentioned he did mention that they were on the on the left and many people have told me the left or violent Clyde you've got to start talking about how the left or violent yes they are violent\nI've seen that myself here in my own home town I seen it all over the country now this type of rhetoric do the Donald Trump talked about the violence if we don't win\nIs now being foot noted in being pointed out by the news that you know they basically saying we'll see you see you see he wants to violence\nYou see the arguments are such that they can be both ways and extremism became\nEven more intense after CNN's Christian um and poor\nSat down with the interview with Hillary Clinton I'll listen to what Christian ... said she talks about the mirror and the black nearing or the dark nearing and the idea of a vast left wing conspiracy against Donald Trump and listen to what Hillary Clinton's response was\nCayenne Conway the presidential advisor talked about this process and she said it ... left wing conspiracy it echoes what you said about when your husband was being presented by investigations back in the Nineteen Abbas white right wing conspiracy\nSocial you comment on that merit language and secondly these anyway even a conservative think speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America should try to get back to some civility and to try to make it even if we have to include disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see us return to civility listening to one and now there are working out our differences that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now\nWhen the Republican Senate denied\nThe right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland\nA Kurd I think anything that they stole a justice from that I think they did I mean to keep a court said open for a year\nOr to deny it distinguish jurists they could have voted down they could have said well for ideological reasons philosophical reason that we're not going to vote for him but no they don't ...\nAnd that was such a breach a horn of Africa and the constitutional responsibility of a Senate to advise and can harp on Mount ...\nThat you cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house band or\nActually that lady can start a dark\nSo she says when we get the Senate back ... ability will start again but until then civility or instability if you will will not continue\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy you stand for and what you care about and that's why she said I Believe we're fortunate enough to win back the White House in the Senate that's when civility can started getting there you have a declaration of civil war and a license for violence\nDonald Trump said violence if the Republicans don't get the vote Hillary Clinton says violence until we get the boat or we we haven't since really until we get the votes so\nMotive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary not not that the vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and instability you can create in order to change the direction of the vote and that's that's very disconcerting\nAnd ... it's on president I mean while while the media will say that Trump's words are to be expected they failed to expound upon the comments she made Hillary Clinton made no one not even her interviewer\nChristian I'm a poor cheating stop her and say wait a minute wait a minute are you saying you know civil war would continue or it's really ... I mean she didn't say this is reckless she didn't say you're fueling the fire you know the fire it's already been started\nConsequences be damned a civil war has to happen in order to take over the ... that's\nThat's what I'm getting from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump I mean her claimed civility can return when Democrats have power is it a mission that the ends justify the meat I mean this is at a\nTime when Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nMailed a merry mailed and rice in powder or run out of restaurants sent death threats I mean Hillary Clinton or just Democrats to be even more on civil [noise]\nI mean [noise] ... [noise]\nI mean I said two nights ago that this is a civil war New York post yesterday said this is these are words the civil war [noise] and now hearing Hillary Clinton I'm beginning to think well look if they're going to keep being angry and keep doing these problems up until the the boat and then they changed the boat and then the Republicans get violent\n[noise] what what are we in [noise] what is it true belief except at three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six Seventy three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\nNot the real truth that pits you off when you hear it because no one wants to hear the ugly truth they just want to hear troop that makes them feel good and the truth is that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\nRecently said that there would be violence Trump's that they'd be violence if the Republicans did not win the Senate\nAnd the other equipment says there'll be continued instability unless they do when Joe unless the or the Democrats do win so both of them it's kind of said that well we know what everybody is going to do and and they're not saying don't do that they're not saying don't they're just saying this is going to happen it's like it's inevitable witty and that's the thing that bothers me about this\nYear we have no choice they're like you're going to happen regardless whether you want to live\nWell and we're already seeing we're already seeing the the the uh\nThe aftermath of this I mean but the the left wing media say if you ever been to a Trump rally it's a mob and they said well have you ever see what happened during the cabin are hearing it was a mob and uh they're all saying it's not a mob anti thoughts about a mob you know and what are you saying there protesting there protesting peacefully\nBut pounding on the doors in screaming and yelling and ended up costing people in the blocking traffic and then telling some white guy in a car these white by a white guy I mean it's just insanity it doesn't make any sense\n[laughter] better Clyde a U.S keep on keep on doing what you're doing and I'll be less I appreciate\nThat thank you so much uh I I got this from surely I call my biases my values I'm biased on

right nor does it make the moral morality is when you do good to others morality is when you do good to yourself morality is when you love God morality is\nWhen you continue to spread hope and and you

this so uh you know\nI don't know it just seems to be this is what they're talking about and so then when people started commenting about the whole I uh what Hillary\nClinton said and what Donald

...\nThat the rule of law in this in this city not at all ah\nIt it's like you know the same as living right without the knowledge but we still have the same kind of their employees you know I don't know if you're saying you know a little before last they shut a major bridge going across the river to live as\nWell when we when we have okay well we have groups that are ah basically blocking

would be a ice takeover here the icy takeover in ah Oregon\nSame thing happened in fact they were saying that what he did was\nUnconstitutional in and would be a and I think there is somebody actually suing him for what happened there but we also have a governor here that is very corrupt she's actually a there are a lot of things that she's doing right now\nBut in my opinion uh would would probably weren't arrest as well for some reason we have two very corrupt leaders\nA mere Portland is a corrupt leader and the mayor in a\nIn a new governor of Oregon and super corrupt\nAnd both of them are in power right now\nAnd so either going to wait it out to the election but in my opinion [noise] somebody's got to be done sooner than later [noise] and uh after and this is why we're in the position

let all this debt run up and all this you know free\nMoney and stuff and the and the Democrats say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's got to be fact I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything that there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument and its argument in hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy no that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yet there's very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and do everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her as well it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero hour\nAnd and are newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the big us what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes\nAnd this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global his\nLawn you know here you had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying there timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ... meter ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a\nTwo thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally comment and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprise when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nHum and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just ...\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year\nAnd Trump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or at best Trump polls on\nNotice after we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble laughing pass next to the end of next year but there is there's a fifty fifty chance of happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nForty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit in China made the biggest one was the only stock market that violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up to even but it's still violated but the U.S markets looked like the ... going to open up two to three hundred points tomorrow now that's minor compared to\nFourteen hundred points over just the last\n... stay with us we're going to come right back we'll talk more take phone calls with you next on coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now

Nineteen thirty six harnessing the power of the mighty Colorado River the Hoover Dam begin sending electricity over transmission lines spending two hundred and sixty six miles of mountains and desert to run the lights radios and so's Los Angeles\nThis week in Nineteen fifty six New York Yankees right hander Don Larsen pitches the first no hitter in the history of the world series\nEven better it

went outside to find a sizable hole in the rear end of her car a matching hole in the gravel driveway underneath the car and then the whole bowling ball size media right\nWhile media rights are fairly common and media right hitting a car is not car is after all very small objects on a very large planet in fact as far as scientists know it is only happen twice before once in Illinois during the Nineteen thirties and one's in St Louis and this week in Nineteen Ninety eight the U.S house of representatives\nVotes to proceed towards impeaching President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury\nAnd obstruction of justice by December Nineteen Ninety eight the Republican led house gathered enough information from investigation committee to vote in favor of impeachment which in turn sent the case in the Senate\nBill Clinton was the first president to be impeached by the house of representatives Andrew Johnson in Eighteen sixty eight Johnson was also when\nYou look back and says we can history\nMichael on his way out subject Callahan Fox News still a tropical storm but just barely the remnants of one was hurricane Michael now moving across coastal Virginia and soon headed out to sea back in Florida the clean up as\nLeader one dollar deal gay\n\n\n\nMan walking back to cruise to re done with us we'll get to your calls as well Harry within the can you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they would predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the differences George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent that we're so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money that\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nOn George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people of the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just go into Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be kind of solution to be in the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting and people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farming commodity products to you know of transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world that makes people\nAngry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said as soon as they are all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing is well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and continuity Arizonans and get things started with a side Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a fight ... city tour in Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're going to take your deposits\nAnd work in a kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money other\nThan you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms to have to\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits and savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly when it happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext up we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr that I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars for the hurricanes struck him because of all the corruption there which is the ...\nThe reason why the recovery has been slow the former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in ... here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work enough tax payer for having to pay for their relief\nAnd the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people laugh not happening up here uh in New York the former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people leave the state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas or formerly all red state which is now only purple a to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having now I'm going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote in our herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times and like\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China what ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question there's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody is big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIt is there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be a long before we ... so I think that's kind of a good thing\nOr in in the early Nineteen hundreds and hundreds no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have one or two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political jeez this trade war we said in zero hour before this became obvious this is going to last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but they're certainly\nGoing to be huge a

E. R. dot com\nNow George thinks that it's not going to happen and I don't know I kind of think it will\nBut I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few links and because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is\nThat they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans or to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTo thousands here in one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollar voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well here's a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like a did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger\nOnly made the rich richer is only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted to volunteer as opposed to check because I wanted them to be forced to spend that red line them you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or ... you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and to have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good them\nWell hello there George an area that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but I'm the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with all those\nI I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank because that's where all the leverage is been there was kind of opposite in the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms were over expanding and borrowing money and those ...\nAnd more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do with bank if governments have ticks procreate money or pork how they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and that was going to be in the in the bigger money center bag so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America Wells Fargo or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOr tell yeah okay thank you and\nI think yeah I guess in that part of one of my question I asked\nA direct tonight at ... at one of my ... Hi I'm ... I cannot act like hey wait a second line\nRight yup they put all about timing\nIt all of that one of my garden moment I call it um what part of it you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so\nMy Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much as I'm at a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can't insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few cows and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get out\nYes you're going to be weightless all of all that and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people going to hit for the positives more Iceland went down and basically all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't\nPledge doses reserves and well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a

Russians as\nWell welcome to the program Dr many mate is on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nAnd for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders are my first came out many people ask me if they'll click based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor it's confidential\nAdopted bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be paid anything he told by a sense and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPie stories from my readers and to my audience and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I had the experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls for that so many ... that [noise] um you know\nIf you've got a lot of ... about the near death experience\nMhm [noise] but the um term near death experience you know it's clear that document moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right\nI think he estimated at something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but\nIt's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were announced clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how microbes precious death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\n[noise] in other words I'm having had all these clothes closet that I and to have a deep repudiation of life and I also have over my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and they and then increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the ... um couple the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything that might just kind of ... the ... yeah\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone\nAbout them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why did they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous as themselves don't know it's called in how Jeanette transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOr this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um yeah\nAnd I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact\nThem and I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow so he was flown back into the don't you send for Washington DC\nAnd the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThe abuse still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and ...\nHere altruism you\nKnow he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive in one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required his cheeks swab\n... that's it yeah it just it takes a lot to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bang and then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know\n... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells and they gave him these injections for five days\nAnd then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nAnd Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psyche Rome has that help or hurt your ... your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common you know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it\nI'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post deaf contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death\nContact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife\nAnd many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife um in in fact you know an atheist and they've not sticks have these experiences well as religious people\nYou see that every one is like you and I I tend to believe you agree with you\nOK but when you say that what's the basis for what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP\nOr telepathy or the cognitive beams and other things you've talked about such as visions hundred voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of sake experiences such as ESP\nAnd collapse of the arc strongly common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that person then you\nSay oh you must be ... I was just thinking about you right now is that's\nVery common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than the others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nNumber ... ... with the labor is why we've got the fog everyone's talking about like the famous people ...

paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nUm that actually happened to my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they're so until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWith dying patients and they found\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people received messages in dreams which on the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the message\nChats the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we could save coming from the spirit world\n[noise] you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear mhm\nYou know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\n... there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\n[noise] well that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I didn't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although\nWe don't really know and and how how did we know it's right you know so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't it the cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I thought I I just saw these where it said this is\nA world of illusion ... and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with his favorite told Julius Caesar the where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he northern ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole mini\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they'd disregard things which could be dismissed\nThat superstition there's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and oh yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's going to win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else some loss\nIn ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that it is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear\nI think people are I don't believe in\n[noise] they don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\n\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses\nAre what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the ... and on his doctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded\nThere was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on\nAnd then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures and he wanted his teeth back\nRight you have you\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wild yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr Mr polar mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same event\nSo I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five feet you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pre cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight just log on to ... am dot com\n[noise] on the ground is what we want our soldiers are deployed to protect freedom abroad but now the bring those men and women among\nOur moods on the ground military veterans are twice as likely to fall victim ... euro degenerative disease that robs them of the power to use their legs\nSomeone close\nTo solve some looser you love your own or multiple losing the ability to breeze [noise]\nWhere an alert to the world around them as their bodies graduate the\nWas your last must be stopped\nJoining a a less associations ...\nCan walk to the seat last dot org born\nTo honor and comfort to men and women of our armed forces around the world men and women who have put our dreams and our futures above their own ...\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area make over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call a\nNews radio one thousand Katie okay am Andy Kaye X Y FM Ninety six point one aged ... to\n... heads out their seat belt the clean up the begins ... Callahan Fox News this monster storm devastated the Gulf Coast and our panhandle orders governor Rick Scott how the devastation caused by hurricane Michael so many families have lost everything\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone who's hearing voices as certain qualities that would distinguish the say came from a psychotic experience for example if someone hears the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery and in\nFact it may be more than one voice to hear the voices talking to each other about the person\nThe voices might be a accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and to be ... feet when\nThey may occur only once had price in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing a voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether that person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family\nIf then if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other than ... aside from the of the nation for example the thought to order or paranoid I'd be a ... or you know feelings have ...\n... people talking about and that type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is that conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it had happened there is a psychologist that did it and experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had to each one of them go to a different emergency room and different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices and in each case\nThe patients while they were patients they were actors pretending to be patient\nAha that they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... there were admitted to the war they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the word the patients that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their parents their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors couldn't figure that out\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nWell that's true but but the patients didn't\nEffect because well the patients live with it they they know the on a cell well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that said\nAll right let's take some calls here for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have like my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London and then they go and I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European front\n... well that's where I used to go as out of body experience when I was little and there are a whole bunch of other up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were out in spirit that not ... and\nThey were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be any\n[laughter] but you did that it is a remote viewing huh\nNo I ...
