they are outraged about something else\nBut they are turning up we got to turn up I said all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win and saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you gotta stay we can't just be fat how being\nLazy and expect this stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz he

how do you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama dude and fixed everything how can Obama even for a second even think to himself yeah I did that because we're\nNot we're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media will yeah like I said oh no this is the new normal one point ... percent lifted that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that front because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact that in bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of the ticket\nI mean that's the only way you know his his\nMoney is coming from all places other than like this\nBecause you know those are Texas the values that he espoused or you know

very positive we said you know really was no ... rode\nOut for me always as by Kavanaugh said last week some of us wake up on the sunrise side of the mountain right\nI'm sure that great time to be alive as president is doing a fantastic job in keeping us peaceful and prosperous some you can art and you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think is why the mainstream media refused to cover them they've never seen a positive data point that they have it ignored enough and I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy jealous God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among\nAfrican Americans and Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans in women teenagers and veterans and\nAnd the growth rate is up but even today got very little coverage anywhere\nBut there was an accident have one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and

they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominate joy Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting\nJudge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this says this is about the strike destroying a man's life\nBecause he he was nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open in passing the terms of not three twenty twenty and America has had it\nAmericans are smart and they're watching this process people are disgusted

it's the Senate Judiciary committee and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice in the air this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on

inject for a long time now in social media recently guess what fifty million people there from Asia to just really out there and and they're still rolling you you're still scratching me they're still stopping conservatives from having a voice here there was this this professor\nCan we can with Joe packs one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty\nFive or ... year before we wrap it up a and\nAgain we look forward to this vote is going to happen in the guess forty five minutes or so from now as we do show live again a lot of you will get the show after the voters happened and uh and I just want to remind you that this radio station that you're listening to the show on will be all over what's happening with ... votes and make sure you keep it right here let me go to the ... lines do and Marie in New York Marie what's going on\nI'm Joe I I was visiting a main this week\nWe're packing up\nTo leave to go home Thursday march we had the news on and our room and there was a tape burning across the TV that there was a college in Maine that was a loading a feat busloads go down there and a reminder Susan Collins to make sure she was voting no\nTo her after I imagine but uh this was a an offer of a credit if you got on the bus so to me uh this is almost like a ... um I find my grand kids that are going to our local schools\nYou know that uh the pledge of allegiance is optional um if you do the pledge allegiance you get kinda pushed around a little bit over I Believe\nSo uh I'm kinda disheartening at our school systems in this country um\nWell I'm ... I'm a strong advocate of getting rid of the department of education living mistakes take care of education the way he was supposed to be Jimmy Carter with the department of education employees and to me it's a waste of fifty some odd billion dollars a year as far as giving credit for somebody going in protesting\nI Would I Would love to see where that actually happened and I would love to follow up on that you know what school it was\nA I forgot the name seven years old and I forget to watch anyway\nNo way listening Seventy still young you got plenty of time so do you favor or send me an email at ... dot com and if you remember where that school was I'd love to follow up on it\nIf it's a state sponsored taxpayer subsidized school there's no way they should be doing something like that private school they've got different rules but that would be ridiculous to do to give somebody a benefit for protesting on one side of an issue over the other let me go to line three Patricia ... Patricia what's going on\nHi how are you I'm living the dream was happening\nI think if I can get on that movie that's coming out from off but then after a week ago I call it they can that crack convening crap from allies\nNice and I think that I Love the pullout dying\nFind ... hit me by egg\nFace should apologize capital of family and for the public and I think if they don't like it here and they're thinking now kept on now is shaping poured that now having you know I Know with the money up land line grab you and the and burning yeah\nFamily up in the Arab that Bush Trump to let you can only and that they can crack felt blindsided and get like they were kids they don't get the way they go on and Wellman shops but they were doing a lot of shopping like half a guess firmed and how common state in the kitchen\nBut we still are still coming in\nAnd help me clean and having\nThat American where at that race that whole like later they haven't gotten to where we come back and kind of high tech evil horrible people and in fact find someone like her\nBut just shy appreciate your maturity to board him too but but and and don't hold your breath because none of those people are going to be apologizing in fact are dying and Feinstein just friday just yesterday said are you just went down a litany of why Brett Kavanaugh should not be the guy and it had very little to do\nInterestingly very little to do with the allegations that she leads to her office leaked about Christine Blasey Ford very little to do with that\nHer complaint was that he showed drew interrupting her interrupting other members and his anger you show that he doesn't know the temperament to be on the court that's being able to do with no\nHe doesn't have the temperament to be on the court\nOh by the way members on the left on that committee interrupted Chuck Grassley the Republicans nonstop\nI guess they have the temperament to be on the Senate Judiciary committee and to be senators but he doesn't know the temperament to be on the court when he was honestly emotionally reacting to people treating his family like crap\nPeople calling him a gang rape is he had every right to react the way that he did and die and Feinstein is all of this new she knows that she is let me go back to and say Hi to Dan in Tampa download on on high\nHey Joe thank you all for taking my call but I bet\nThat's all I just want to make a comment and then I Want to get a question as to bite you and I'll hang up\nOr down vote I think\nWe've had it I think it's been years that we've had a beyond that this rule they want to pick your president they want to make the rules people are tired of the math contradictions convoluted logic\nThe same political correctness pseudo wise retention it's all over there and the tide is turning and thank God for that\nAnd I think a great president was the one who started this and put us on the threshold IRA\nI'm thankful for that you know um and I and I heard your last call and your great for doing what she did diamond and still semi gods and hope is a a princess than Donald Trump junior for your listeners should be taking the mantle from his father and he should be running someday cause that\nHe's fired definitely\nOh man I mean that great this family it's not just hey nothing but crucifixion Kuwaitis liberal paid back at what they do to that family grateful just by\nEverything that they do is just absolutely disgraceful and you know what it is getting to know where you can throw the kitchen sink at him and for all the power let them you can throw a refrigerator ride them it doesn't matter he never went you\nHe's going to and they're still go and write down I don't I don't have much time what's the question\nWhat do you think now we do that house and Mr yeah\nYou think that what what would the increase can process the like and and what what grounds that we have or in the school because that's all they talk about\nThe left will say it's obstruction of justice if they should win the house and they will interact with\nTheir with their job for the bill claims bill claimed that he tried to do call me to not investigate the women to be more bill said that he tried to obstruct justice to stop calling me know you look you and I agree he didn't do that\nBut those are the grounds they'll say obstruction of justice I think they will in fact impeach him and I think the Senate would would uh would find him not guilty so nothing would happen\nBut that's the whole thing and it's a great question because the\nThe voters in this country have to realize if you vote for Democrats in November one month from today if you vote for Democrats you're voting for impeachment you're voting for open borders you're voting for abolishing

emails than a one of the world's few science based paranormal investigators he's done a firsthand research into all the different phenomenon and this is cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well we'll have to ask them about that but he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA study in this kind of stuff psychics goes on and houses ... miracles that's you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about his miracles but also Bigfoot lake monsters and you know a lot of things like that UFOs reincarnation crop circles all sorts of goodies\nAnd he is known for solving mysteries um the Santa Fe court house goes in two thousand seven\nUh also will have to ask you about

I mean I I Love will if we need a trademark that that's great\nI Know right I should have went over there and check out the domain hurry up get it for me please [laughter] somebody's got snagged that right off of it\nThat's fun stuff so you're very similar to me he got the old TV background and the passion to know the truth and to study everything and try to pull it altogether so when I you know found you know I was like oh my\nGosh he's like he's like this was great so now how have you been able to go all across the planet I mean you've been everywhere this this is this is good\n[noise] well there's a there's a it's a good question actually if you point out there's a level of money and [laughter]\nRain grow by some sort of X. files department but I'm not simply\nYou know I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of a magazine a couple of inquire new things like that but I Am but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I tried to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so part of the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like for if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at goats again\nAll right you know like they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there is a monster out there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and\nSo that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa notes where uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just is what it is you just can't help but it's it's in your mind that's what you do you you would if you were at that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would be what a what a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nAnd all these sorts of another one example is a body for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition that if you cut appeared if you kill them apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband\nSo there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass me credit coming together\nOn my way may I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] actually I Do it and do it at midnight\nRight in Harlem willfully night that's right will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it as fun I see it\nAs a I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think us fall whether I think of orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which is an led goblins and\nAnd it varies bond funds things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they kicked the fun out of it in the tradition data that and\nAnd ah I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have in a band rapper with\nUs he is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as coastal folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know there's a lot

local news international happenings always up to date on air and online that Katie okay dot com\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on ... ... talking with Ben Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that ... that he had found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you exactly\nI was just such an offensive of like the first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they x-ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I Want to offer but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go and train your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist often are actually at the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you know yeah\nI don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers okay but he did it yes so that he can see all the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here was you know we need to go back to the days when people were mommy for soles of of of you know purgatory this that you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nNo no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily a strict with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have ... they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years um\nOf course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask\nWell your people were having to be creative you know boy though\nYou'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a kids' costumes and what you find is that the\nFirst the first record that I found up Halloween masks\nAre really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your past the molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turned into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's ... it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the sexy police\nOfficer or a drag yeah and of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I\nI sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell a ... a good question you know I think that um you know following mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations\nOf Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we're with each\nInteract with each you know ... a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far\nIn Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum who doesn't like to dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kid just eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nYou know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual go you know where you\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that because he had that he was this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to are asking about this the panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is Willis ... tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\nAre they up Thanksgiving this week in Nineteen fifty seven the Soviet Union inauguration space age with its launch of the world's first artificial satellite spacecraft\nTo his name's Nick after the Russian word for satellite the U.S government military and scientific community were caught off guard by the Soviet technological achievements and they're United efforts to catch up with the Soviets heralded the beginning of the space race\nThis week in Nineteen sixty five so called didn't arrive at the Kennedy international airport in New York City the first visit by renting post to the United states during his pac\nOne day American visit limited entirely to New York city hall visited St Patrick's cathedral met with President Lyndon Johnson and other actors and one adult film star that's your look back at this week in history\nDifference but the one in two hundred Americans living with chronic disease or I was thinking of ... which are in terrible to me that's the ... foundation of America take steps walks will empower\nInspired and connect you with other patients and caregivers in your community there one hundred twenty take steps walked across the country because I knew what can you answer registering did you see the take steps\nBattles and Katie okay am an ex X Y Amsterdam Ninety six point one agency to\nAlmost a\nLifetime job begins I'm rich Dennison Fox News the Senate on Saturday confirming Brett Kavanaugh onto a seat on the Supreme Court followed by a swearing in Republicans and Democrats still reeling from a long process\nGot a great story part of Orem al\n... your guy that has overcome a severe issue\nI I went to light the light bulb went on and I started to research on the ...

oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGhost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about\nThat let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creeping from you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grabs her grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that's if for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before\nUm before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is coming to a team you know thou shalt not suffer which to live\nOn and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more\nUh obviously comes up every every year coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nHum and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to see James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go to them and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it it said a word you board or strictly prohibited anyone using ... board will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nSo concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is\nUh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party\nSo the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights and uh\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to Christmas [laughter] just the way it was right down the\nMarathon borrow either right away I assumed\nYou'd freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nThey were great under you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came in that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here that\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um\nThat uh what's his face with a lot fewer seats for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup\nYup never on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now so well\nKnowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street\nThe location maybe there's team of him and do you know they'll take readings for three hours or sick or whatever else will go home and analyze\nThe

Sinclair now we can talk to him about so many things but tonight we're going to talk about the we're ... we're going to talk about the flicks didn't wear wall\nSo Paul Sinclair Paul welcome to coast to coast how are you\nI'm good can come and thank you very much for allowing me to come on here and shut a bit of information um you know when I first started researching for the truth proof the story of the flexed and kept in little snippets of information would\nCome through and I in all fairness I never expected myself\nDoing as much in depth research about too because I'm I'm not here tonight to subscribe to the idea of like cancer or what but I Do believe\nSome thing exists something very real otherwise you know to being reported income over a period of hundreds of is you know through the through the ages of ... I mean [laughter]\nAnd ancient piece of where the where the story originates from Coney which is the full extent stock which is probably the most important archaeological sites in Britain and one of the most important sites in the uh\nYou know some of your listeners may not have even heard of it were were researching I'm\nStuck out his mentally fit middle stone age or just give me give you the outline of oh yeah absolutely\nIt's it is a key logical side dating back to nine thousand base\nMiddle stone age just after the ice age people federal\nAnd these people were just home together that they actually settled on flicks didn't stuck\nIt in the lake of going now we've got ... to me to have cows run across stuck it in some places you can feel the ground reverberate because he's so ... ... ... and\nThe people I mean there's the evidence of how home ever built\nIt by the Israeli settlers in the u._k. and what was interesting in the research it turns out that the archeologists also found read their school in like a dress with\nHoles and for our eyes and leather straps told the mumble they believe that the only people or shame on them they practice the ship\nA now I'm not saying that is the reason we have the stories of the flexed and well we'll put it is interesting that when you sort of cast your mind to was that transformation into other animals and other based as they started combing through\nFrom these early people I mean I think we have to consider these things as I say I don't particularly think there's a person running round in quotes off times howling at the moon but I'm One hundred percent believe that the people who've come forward and told me the stories of the flakes too well we'll\nTelling the truth I mean\nIf you like a refuge was built county in the ... century I took place called ... corner inflicts them\nIt was built by a king all this can be research listeners you know it's not just things that poll is made up\nA and the king was stunned and he ... he gave a night the job of building the refuge and the night it's a fabulous name what's called a home so he built this refuge to protect Trump travelers from an infestation of salvage based\nOn the scene like\nYeah it's fabulous some spots where the name spittle hospital comes from which was built to that's why they call it spits O'Connor\nOr at least they be devoured I I was lucky enough to contact the people in our own ... what is now the ... in ... after they've been stopped safe being a refugee hundreds of years ago because this wasn't nine\nFifty seven but this refuge was built so we're going back a long way obviously not far back as the early settlers of stock or\nA bill had but it was due to protect travelers from an investigation of Savage beast\nLeast they be devoured it said now I look to that date in the ... some of the ...\nAnd that's what it says under is documentation on the line that you'll find that says this we we must also not forget ... ... you know during this time we will divide wolves prevalent in the u._k. and best so\nYou know ... we're not necessarily to an entirely talking about too where will this these stories that are quite

the u._k. out there right now early morning for him and we're talking about basically the werewolf of London the selection werewolf in particular\nAnd uh if you go to our website there's some really great sketches\nFrom some of the a witness\nTestimonies of what was seen and we were just talking\nPreviously with Paul about the uh werewolf that was seen holding something and if you go to the site you'll see featured a these sketches that Paul did by the way he's an artist as well and just just when you see when you see it coming to life\nWhile someone's you know drawn it it's a it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses now Paul wonderful artist uh sketching that you did I Know that you're an artist as well and a former carpenter\nAnd so now what you do is you like to ... year retired and you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nA ... you know that that is the story I mean the the ... gallons of ... ... this\nCattle grazing it's looked slum whether it be in the old sort of like but I imagine imagine the sediments and everything is produced so to ... very fertile ground\nWell yeah yeah I don't think that's why the cows and not race offices in it you know the first thing in\nThe Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it I think that you know\nAnd he did it a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching heads and ... and places that they shouldn't be in um private one and um it was a place called Fox ... in green Dale which is\nEight miles from flicks than any still lives in Glendale and it's an interesting story\nHe said it was with a friend said need noted for the past week or two weeks that something was ripping the prey out to be snazzy what might it might snow to catch the rub it in the has the other game small game\nAnd it was the ice is proper so to Britain ... born and bred and he's with pretty ragged him out to ... as\nYou said but we couldn't ... he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you know still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a Roosevelt ... as you look over towards the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching\nIn the daytime and there's a large hedge hall forums and things about he said he probably eight to ten ... so he sort of turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and he's peripheral vision and then looked and saw it\nOn the left over the head ... he said but he thought he was a U hauls it meant halls so hate older bless each with only want to give them also just\nSuck ... believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is that this thing was as big as a small pony or you you know your house\nIt's an interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait experts a horse to lend to move forward because the momentum this thing just one that I'm stuck like a magnet\nHe said something to me and I look at that\nIs it and he was the most ... thing he'd ever seen them before you run away he said he was on all fours\nAnd he said if you still don't get to that being over seven foot and looked like a body builder he said you know if anybody tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of about ...\nAnd ... and he said he's able to do sort of Britain billing cooler you know like a box that do go all the stuff that you both areas\nAnd that what he's citing he says well he said I went on to the edge to them to try and get the if it's just to protect myself it says although there's nothing we could have done it this thing I decided he was going to come across to us they said the speed it covered\nCrossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible\nUm you know ... miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast corny but if you if you go further down the coast towards home or in the papers probably two years ago they were the ... there were featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd it was such as supposed to be aware of it was such a going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we go we will type creature reported it moving along the coast and they could go for the coast you got\nOld folklore don't let your own legends of talks with glowing red eyes the ... the ravens Scott ... they too hot food\nAnd you know these stories after they've come down to being hounded down in time that I think that's grains of truth in the story so that was the right thing in the Nineteen seventies and they lived in Britain all his life and\nHe's never seen it since he's never seen it before that I'd never seen it after that\nWhich is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story about this thing was negative to that Saturday you would think that they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it Kony was made\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talk to people before uh we had um\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's in a remote viewer in I Would have heard target big flood and as she targeted she had mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know she is looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these portals\nAnd they would end time warps and and they would just go through one time warp and then another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know in ... where where human would see I'm\nI'm I find I find it also interesting uh when you were saying that Ari yes is there the world's oldest the operational radar base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens\nAnd I think I remember seeing a sure thing\nThat might be my thought about it puts out people just ... it does it's cutting in and out so well is showing no actually it's all now I'm a I'm Sorry about that listeners to join me to hang up and you got me back up you know well\nWell you're fine right now for sure and will do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it I think it's very strange that this operation a radar base the oldest one is in the midst of all of these happenings that you're talking about\nThat's correct thrown in June ... briefly jumping to them to the animal mutilation taking place\nThere's a ... which are they living miles from stocks the world as the crow flies and that one's close that one closed about Seventy to basically said sixty eight but he was still operational baseball clean fill Seventy two [noise]\nAnd that's on the edge of the north sea audio Ben tune that remain\nOkay now he's gone [laughter]\nSo it will definitely contacting back on one of his other phones that he has there isn't that crazy brand new song a brand new batteries and it goes out\n... strange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that I don't know I don't know\nYou always on the story [laughter] we'll just wing\nContinues here on coast to coast am I'm tiny Willis and we've got Paul Sinclair is our guest we're and talk more about the police didn't

ago\nThe werewolf infliction\nAnd other crazy crazy things that are going on in the area that he lives around\nAnd he's learning them in east studying them and he writes about them and tonight we get to hear about them ourselves so first time ever on coast to coast and already on his second phone so we've cleared up the phone deal\nSo Paul I'm welcome back with your new phone hopefully this one will last a little bit longer and strange things happened when we talk about strange subjects I'm\nVery much [laughter] yeah yeah that was kind of funky for sure\nWell Ghani honestly they were brand new but I'm On a wire phone now so ... which would be fine um you know when we were jumping into the store you know trying to give listeners a breakdown of why they why the area\nSpecial and how the stories of coming through and a little bit of history about the area and everything's quite close to the coast as well Tony you\nKnow in most instances but only like four miles away from the coast to the point\nAnd these and the this coastline around bread linked to slumber them to the un speech and the rugged cliffs with absolute must have network of sea caves some of them have never been never be an end to it I mean if if we romance with the notion that this was a real living flesh and blood creature breathing\nBreathing and surviving then I suppose it could function in in these areas simply\nBecause of our ... in ... anybody would get a bit of research would find the ... and there's more ships being wrecked out to say than anywhere else in the u._k. you can't get close to these cliffs\nA you know I'm not saying that that's where these things and how they believe is just an angle to look at the\nBoats I'm staying quite close to flexed and county and twelve miles away there's a huge area of would love to know if you're in North Yorkshire called ... Dale [noise]\nAnd we can sort of accurately they to the summer of two thousand and six and three young men or mountain bikes\nSort of setting the trailers and doing what oh well all you guys are ... women girls as well with doing a good so to ride around the woodland pots\nAnd this one may fall into the big for type ... is nevertheless an interesting story or late evening still light on the the ... the ... about four foot high and there's all trees all around them as the recycling down these parts\nOf the ... mountain became aware and shouted tuition says can you see that they said about forty four away from them that on the path in the ... and moving that going down ... down these hills\nIs what they described as an upright gorilla now they described it says ... because he didn't appear to be ruining\nAnd that they that black fur covered very big uh you know what I think we're talking like over eight feet tall\nA while to get the ... before it's all in the city for four to ... votes at least\nAnd these things they described it says like it was on a track\nYour ... you know they couldn't see legs and they said they were living up around ... Dale they were familiar with most of the\nThe ... the phone or on rocks and an ally of the ... there's no way that it wouldn't have been jumping over fall and branches and rocks\nFor this thing ... was just smooth and gliding over the top of the Bracken as though it was just fixed ... he says when we were going as fast as we could cause us at ... did he frightening says hell yeah they said we were absolutely terrified\nSaid because they were keeping pace with us and it was looking after that was the strange thing as well ... well it didn't seem to have to look forward\nWas look it was fixed on them so is it eventually we go to the ... past which faults off to the left until the right to sudden we went right sort of choosing the path that will take them far away from this thing and they left it that's all the scene of it [noise] it\nYes these two friends if they wanted to talk about it I got the story of one of the guys that they still tobacco the story but they they didn't want to they didn't want to come forward\nOr with the amount of detail that this this month so if they're given my\nBook I think probably county we're looking at more something big foot relate to that but once again there's a mystical element to it in the he's not running in the way the conventional way we would expect something to ruin all moving should I say you know [noise]\nSo yeah he you know it's it's [noise]\nWe just got before a little bit you know we we talk a little bit before we did this and say Hi to each other and one of the things\nThat that is tough for both of them is there's no word that really work in our language for what this is so hard to describe the scene and are these events as well as the beans in the creatures themselves like\nYou just can't put into words whatever's going on there whatever it is it's beyond what we know and what we're supposed to know or see or what is supposed to be real and it's so hard to describe these things when you put together I mean yeah we want to focus on the where we'll split\nBut when you put all his together in the area that you are there are so many things that are going on\nIn radius\nAnd again going back to the fact that these radar bases were there there was a picture\nThat you had did you mean I guess it's been one of your book that was a picture I'm a I guess there were some happening then they went on some sort of a den and that were seen and then the next day or maybe within the same hours now that there's like vehicle\nAnd it's got some sort of satellite dish on it\nAnd it's going up to this guy I mean after these events Nichols there\nThat the country you're you're talking about something that we saw\nIn on July the twenty fifth the twenty seventh thing to just if we if we major jump from the ... for a moment he's yeah sure\nThese vehicles I got a phone call from a guy called David hind\nUh lives in the village of them and he said Paul I think you really need to go and look at these vehicles out and I did just that I took a camera I got pictures of them and they were the drums and they had a huge green books from the back with a radar dish on the top [noise] um I'm trying to do this ... going to cause I'm realizing you might want\nMe to carry on with the world will take your time\nAnd ... and that was a huge trailer which we now know how to ... a a generator which would top to now the license plates with German a\n... on the the units themselves was American [noise] bad\nIn an area the little known this script village called ... and the patch I'm Blake Hounshell lane Blake how Blake can bring ... to them slumber to them and what you mean black they say something Blake choice black how ... and\nIt just so happened a few weeks before I'd go photographs of a triangular impression the period in pay crop that somebody told me about\nOn black Halloween [noise]\nOn the twenty fifth of July when these vehicles will say you know the state weeks by the way they weren't just that on the twenty fifth of July the same night we got photographs of light so under the sea or I don't say they like to lay out in the ... we we are the images that you know because a lot of people can say these things and complicates oh\nJust three points of light to him to the scene daylight\nAnd wound up on the cliff drops I received a phone call from a guy who is you know he's not Paul Sinclair or no you're interested in UFO subject my daughter's just seeing a UFO the ... the night previously\nDescribed a UFO and this was about six miles away a lot of miles away to a place called gas and um the walls and interestingly just enough to comment he said there's something else as well I said oh what was that\nHe said well it's a huge amount of ... just ... tough road with a big dish on the top pulling a trailer another one we later found that there were six of these units around the area when this high strangeness was occurring\nNo this is the same time ... all the shape will be mutilated

our first guest tonight excuse me even our second guest tonight\nIs the same way so this is going to be a fun night part of a wheel a swing and a solely fun maybe we'll learn some things tonight as we go so our first guest here\nNever been on pills before\nBenjamin a Radford Columbian or at least I'm going to call and then he signs as emails Ben uh one of the world's few science based paranormal investigators he's done a firsthand research into all the different phenomena ... and this is cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well we'll have to ask them about that but he's been in sixteen countries four\nContinents a study in this kinda stuff psychics goes on and houses ... miracles that that's you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about this miracles but also Bigfoot lake monsters and you know Loch Ness things like that us knows reincarnation crop circles all sorts of goodies\nAnd he is known for solving the mysteries of the saddest they court house goes into thousand seven\nAre also will have to ask you about that you ... Cabrera\nAnd twenty can he he knows a whole lot about creepy clowns he calls them bad clowns I'll call them creepy clouds they are bad clowns and he's the first to bull to fully examined\nThe evil clown phenomenon and I was going to talk about that tonight within the there's so much to talk about with him but I think I Want to say that for something else or another gay 'cause you can actually talk about ... bad clowns you won't be out three hundred sixty five days out of the year right\nSo uh we're going to get some we're going to get we're going to learn about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh it it's just really cool to meet him because he's been all over and you know he's been all over television as well and he does like to keep a science based so let's bring 'em on here\nFor the first time ever and coast to coast welcome Dan to coast to coast am how are you\nA picture of me I I Love will if we need a trademark that that's great\nI Know right I should have went over there and checked out the domain hurry up get it for me please [laughter] somebody's got snagged that right [laughter] or of it\nThat's fun stuff so you're very similar to me he got the old TV background and the passion to know the truth and to study everything and try to pull it all together so when I you know found you I was like oh my\nGosh he's like he's like this is great so\nNow how have you been able to go all across the planet I mean you've been everywhere this this is this is good\nWell there's a there's a it's a good question actually as you point out there's a lot of money and [laughter] right [laughter] and grow by some sort of X. files department but I'm not [laughter] ... you\nKnow I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo [noise]\nUm and for them I'm a ... of a magazine a couple of inquire new things like that but I Am but unified from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folk or point of view\nAnd so one took part of the answer question one thing that often happens is that if\nI'm traveling somewhere like if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that oh then look and it goes\nAgain All right you know they're like we're going to we're going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there is a monster so wandering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so\nThat that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere [noise] uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would be would a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a little look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example is a body for Apple you know if you're not new see apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition that if you cut appeal if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass me credit coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] I Do it you know the midnight right in Harlem willfully\nNight ... will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know that you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know I I get there are people\nThat say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that are cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it is fun I see it and I\nI mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think us fall whether I think of orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which is a lead goblins\nIn any theories bond funds things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think you know people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they kicked the fun out of it in the tradition of that and\nAnd ah I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have is Daniel rapper with us he is an investigator\nAnd an end to all the things that were into a as coast folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know there's a lot of writing any looking to the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with his county well let's

of Halloween on Willis ... talking with Ben Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get state panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kinda stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... and when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies\nAnd it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I Want to offer but\nI wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know there's always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist off\nAnd actually the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you know yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so they can feel the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here was you know we need to go back to the days when people are coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWhat we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] 'cause it always raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily stricter the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the the trials be have clean they were dead set against Callaway and that was that was an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years\nI'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know point\nThough you'd actually have families coming together to make a kids' costumes he and what you find is that\nThe first um the ... the first record that I found up Halloween masks are really emerged in about the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your past the oldest and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's ... it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who were you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer\nCostumes or a drag yeah and of course\nAs soon as you have mass marketing then you have\nA you know you have the princess is right you have in the road you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know ... that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell on a really good question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on um\nBut for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum when it was like a dress up well like a dress up right I mean eight year old kids love just eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of your virtual a go you know where you got\nLike holographic oh you've got to that because that was this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to are asking about the state panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is ... tonight\nNever missed a detail or short just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\nThis we walk\nSay they're rock and roll lovers this any last let's take a trip back to this week in rock 'n' roll history\nStart off in Nineteen Seventy eight where the members of Aerosmith bailed thirty bans out of jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during an Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne coliseum stuff for them\nThis week in Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather is attacked by a man who hit them from behind him repeat the phrase Ken is what is the frequency prompting R.
