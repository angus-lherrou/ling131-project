Michael now downgraded to category one hurricane it's now over Georgia\nIs this whole horrible storm passes overhead\nSo it was my little shot up tonight's all the people there in Florida and Georgia and all the places being affected by hurricane might call so anyway so what we were talking about tonight let me just to\nGet back to what we're talking about night so I Am really I'm fascinated here and are not going to let up until I get to the bottom is okay I'm fascinated by the comments coming out of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence\nAnd a\nMessaging extraterrestrial intelligence that city in ... and they're beginning to act as though they located something okay they're not telling us they've located somebody but I've had several meetings one in California University of California Irvine they had a workshop in Texas just a few weeks ago on how to\nIdentify technical signatures in space it's one of the reasons why we brought the black Cuban skull on because we wanted to talk about this techno signatures maybe some people be out there we could pick up on low frequency higher frequency whatever [noise] so\nWe have to look at various ways and aliens would be able to make contact with us or how we make contact with that money on this program as well I mean not just the black you but we've also at times even run brought this up we used it to reduce\nWe'd blow into did reduce and we'd blow them over the over the air blew they did reduce over the air so in hopes that the signal would go out on all the radios all over the country and all the signals all over the country we send this huge orange sounds ancient sound but I'm sure aliens would understand and listened to\n\nAnd uh you know and and nights we do this we've had like UFO's sightings we've had all kinds of cool things going on I just last night\nWe had a a a huge fireball come down out of the sky silent Oregon in Lincoln county up you were telling you about it or we just got tired and Jeremiah calling the programming last are seeing that they said that was the only guy to report it and they saw they wonder if anybody else thought and apparently it had an impact a little bit of boom there\nBut see I've been reading a lot of things lately about this whole techno signature clue stuff and for more advanced um you know what they're looking for more advanced civilizations using these types of signatures\nWell I also was reading that there are some people that are bitter believing that ah that there's more to it than just listening for the techno signatures so that we may be\nUnder the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ears picked up on the signals and unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them in different ways so far there's been no need to panic because they don't know which is how the signals affecting people but it certainly has affected people in the truth is\nThat there are plenty of extraterrestrial signals out there the world's it'd be the whole universe is awash in extraterrestrial signal so we can't even perceive\nOr do\nWe even know about unless someone else ... basically says listen that you hear that that's what we're looking at right now see and so city and many\nThe guys that runs city and Medi spend a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted they're hoping they can find the source before more people pick up on this sounds at the moment they you know because they're buried it actually buried in the\nBackground of earth noise\nBut uh like I said some people are already hearing this pulse speak sound I recently there was a a story out of Sweden where mysterious humming sound was recorded the sound is a constant pulsing home but according to witnesses laughed at forty five minutes to an hour\nOr there was there's a film on the Internet going viral right now a snow covered mountains ... out in the middle of nowhere you living out there a bunch of guys on a\nOn a snowmobiles and they come by occasionally but what you hear is just a really low frequency home and here's that sound this is from a northern Switzerland\nOr a man by the name of Renee crew Pinsky had a record of this back in December after snow fall just recently got the attention of a paranormal investigator sitting here\nIs that ... no that's not the hummus try another ...\nIt's a wait a minute [laughter] here's the hot and that was from Utah here's another um\n[noise]\n\nSo this was filmed by a man named Renee ... Pinsky back in December mysterious humming noise [noise] that day he picked up on he said that uh it was rattling the house she said that he will like it was rattling the sky\nA very mystifying you said it was like something was moving from one end of the sky to the other\nBut it could not figure out what it was it was like so many visible thing move across the sky was rumbling a sonic sound\nIn August so it was a report of another home near ... proving grounds which of course ... proving ground some people say is the northern arm of area fifty one it's in Utah I've been there it has a lot of gates in danger sides don't go in there and uh\nSo here's that sound of the ... Doug way which is a little bit more aggravating to hear but here it is\n...\n[noise]\nNow earlier I had talked about how a sound like these the humming Sweden and the harm in\nAh Utah Doug way reminded me of a well known a recording of police officers in Saint Helens Oregon\nUh they said they saw light a bright light on the Columbia River at four thirty in the morning or for twenty three in the morning and they wanted to be able to record the sound of this ship this space ship as it was taking off from the Columbia and I wanted to\nBut you that moment against you can hear how it compares to the other sounds you've heard so here's the recording of the police officers recording to take up a bit UFO\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] so you have it it's a scene Helens Oregon police officers\nWatching a UFO take off from the Columbia king up their microphone on the radio so you can hear your the home you're the sound and this is why you know these sonic sounds or whatever they may be\nA these strange noises but we're picking up on in the skies not just the orange anymore these homes these lower homes these are these pulsating homes now these could be experimental aircraft\nBut then again they could be as I've said before\nSome sort of techno ... signature technological signature from extraterrestrial okay [noise] some extraterrestrial intelligence [noise] sending posted [noise]\nAnd they're sending them through space or the setting them through the skies and were picking up on [noise] and ah [noise] we don't know what kind of effect it has on people but it certainly amazing [noise]\nTwo years what speech crafted their crops sound like a ... Homs sound like when we play the [noise] so uh I mean if you've heard them and you've written off as a as the night as I'd like to talk with you and and let you and ask you both actually where you've heard them because there's well [noise]\nThere's also possibly the aliens maybe trying to connect us or contact us by some other means I'm going to talk about that as well triple Egypt Seventy three thirty seven hundred ... six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis you listen to ground zero and we'll be right\nAnd then there's the ... brewery neutrino observatory located in the former in a mine complex suddenly Ontario and it's operated by a group called\nSnow lap okay so he's neutrino detecting facilities exist\nAnd they're in in various places around the globe but I find interesting is that they have one in an article called the ice cube and they're they're they're trying to detect neutrinos but recently there was a story in Scientific American that indicated that something was happening ... actually was happening in a in in Antarctica\nBut may see it may even seal the deal on ... communication or actually a signature left behind by extraterrestrial a there are bizarre particles\nTo keep flying out of an article sites and they may shattered modern physics reserve neutrinos there there are special kinds of neutrino and physicists don't know what what they are exactly but they do know\nIt's a ... it comes about and some sort of caused a great a high energy particles blasted its way through space in the beer and then back out the poll yet\nAnd and so this isn't an article something comes in at the top of the planet comes out of the Antarctica\nBut the particles that are coming out\nA physicist are saying this is going to change the standard model of physics if uh we find out\nOr why these are these particles are doing or somebody they don't normally do I mean see you know when you look at the standard model model of particle physics these nano particles were these neutrinos or whatever they may be\nThey shouldn't be able to do what they do but they're doing so I mean look there are low energy between those that can pierce through miles upon miles of rocket affected but these are high energy neutrinos\nAs weather as well as fighting a detecting other high energy\nParticles [noise] they have large cross sections that means they almost always crashing something soon after zipping into or the never make it out the other side but [noise]\nIt's it's been going on since March twenty sixteen [noise] okay [noise] march of twenty sixteen [noise] now do you remember what happened in February [noise]\nI'm twenty six seem [noise] remember what happened\nWith that and [noise] well a refresher memory currently there were a lot of people who have fought but aliens and landed\nIn Antarctica and maybe they kind of have\nBut ah [noise] I'll tell you about the timeline here\nAbout a month before the discovery or the month after the ... the month after the discovery\nOf of these nano particles that something bizarre happened we had a number of people we had a a Russian patriarch in a few others go down to Antarctica ... visit\nThis may be why we'll be back traffic nice turned jail\nLike everywhere so it definitely can email right\nIt's not legal everywhere and it's not legal for teams at all they can cause permanent damage to teens developing brain and it often leads to other try just conversation can happen anywhere and your kids need to know the facts Seventy six percent of teens agreed that with legalization teams may be more likely to experiment with\nMarijuana now's the time to talk to your kids about substance abuse learn more at ... or\n... that five here to help the recovery and how comfortable so let's see if I get a perfect can deliver it and make sure it's working for me that there were times we report\nOn your back on TALK about all the radio one thousand Katie okay [noise]\n\nMean to me the phone\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[laughter] we have celebrate hit us off site [laughter] ...

December twenty Seventeen we heard these homes gate August of twenty Eighteen\nWe heard the strange comes in Utah okay well we go back to twenty six to eight\nYou remember the focus everybody had on Antarctica research into extraterrestrial relationships twenty six feet before march twenty sixteen and the discovery of these strange part\nBowles emanating from Antarctica he's alien neutrinos this

president all went to Antarctica after scientists discovered what could be evidence of extraterrestrial I'll be a communication and our life forms that that live off the air there\n\nOkay we talked about the species that they found there from Boston\nSo uh I mean\nI don't know if you remember back when we talked about they found this new bacterium in Antarctica that can survive solely up the

and the intention experiment underway does the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn walking back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when the several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could see it as a category four or five and we did a little over let's bring it down in the ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about peace intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a a a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri yeah ...\nAnd we calculated the result Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at ... look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up to St Louis has a home property crime went up in St Louis is the home property crime went out went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we get the intention so it's going on here\nWhat do you think this is one of the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWell what healthier we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can share what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I'm thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make it grow faster to purify water\nTo healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of the thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to trend that the odds\nUh because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now maybe he'll thing\nThe experiments you been working on a boy you are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east and also very prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know it's the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work rather than someone who goes into these ... as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of\nForty foot structure after his he broke up with this for a serious\nGirlfriend and he broke and everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLook better in record time the doctors didn't even think it was going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ...

I worked with people from from U. Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and has set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my\nReaders all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be in and out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments\nIf you just do it a week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will tell me really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and\nWe heard a little song down while being like screen why grandma reached down something you're going back to the darkness I managed to notice grandma's rock was wrong she wasn't in it she was standing over just beyond\nMy fault her classroom now we were by the door and a couple of feet in there on the Korean Cleveland\nUnder my nose just wouldn't match or some she touched the match something or other\nMentioned down in rolling was\nBorn in world find out what happened next by reading the book a long way from Chicago by Richard back rather read book ideas literacy dot Gov\nI said from the library of Congress in the ad council\nNext visit read that go to read the ... the court ribbing adventure pieced together by John ...

she suddenly here from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just luck is not just happenstance\nAnd universities are studying the power they what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and we as they say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nervous scientists and we're planning a study at their biology department to looking at the immune system markers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise]\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something ... when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending loved to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas and you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like a ... so that was a big piece for George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intentioned experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you were doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence but\nWe've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror of sex what is that\nWell the mere fact to me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers that stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened\nTo the participants in these intention experiments\nSo when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly ah I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek and remember these are people who were participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives they were getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful [noise]\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to those people it changes their lives being part of it\nWhen we're going to

I've had young people I've had older people and it it works for them I think it's all about\nUsing the techniques that I teach you know and becoming a a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things to intend for it and how to do it but also being part of that group and Jeff meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called um Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist but suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal and it's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of these in these depression and soon after that\nHe got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration system wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right and as soon as we treated\nHis depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year not only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight loss wait the it got back to his you\nKnow his his weight that he was as a young man\nHe um he chewed gum practice he was practicing ... better he\nGot a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression special I'm a special kind of technique\nAnd everything in his life with getting better\nAnd even his training you know his um his trainer at the gym said to him what are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve but he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically net\nAnd there were times when Mitchell would say you know\nI had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert would say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better and so knowing you've got that constant support it really strengthening in every way\nOver the year when when you do these intention not experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what did they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\n[noise] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good intend or I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and
