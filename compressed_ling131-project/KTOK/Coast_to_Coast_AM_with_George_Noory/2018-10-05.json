mean while you just did with millions of people and I and I might add um [noise] this idea of separation of church and state none of us favor a a theocracy so that's not what we're talking about but the\nBut the expulsion of faith from the public square there was never the intent of the framers of the constitution as a matter of fact many states did uh promote various religions again not for me a theocratic a dictatorial point of view but\nJust from a public policy point of view and so we reached a point as a result of a case called ... and ... under an FDR Supreme Court\nWhere you had a gentleman by the name of Hugo Black and Hugo Black or was the first nominee a FDR made to the Supreme Court and he was an Alabama and he was an old time Alabama segregationist\nAnd he uh he was the lawyer for the Clinton for two years as I've explained before and he got involved in that decision the ricin which started the uh the the process for unraveling American history and the public square in terms of face and so forth and\nUh it's very interesting because uh even though he was on the right side of a particular decision he influenced the decision in the universe in case to the point she was anti Catholic and the school buses were picking up a little Catholic kids on the way and they're the big debate over whether you could use public\nFunds that way [noise] anyway I've talked about

Daniel talks about the anti Christ being some sort of demonic hybrid human demon alien I don't know there's a union that will raise temples in honor of bail\n\nThe famous archer Palmyra known as the arch from the temple of bail recreated erected in Washington DC\n\nThey're ... they're recreated arches called the archer trying because before what his erected people would protest and they would scrap the eruption of this this monument to bail\nNow I don't know if you know\nBut the arch of course the answer to digital archeology\nUnveiled a replica of the Palmyra in Syria arch the triumph large the arch dedicated the horn God bail on September\nTwenty six twenty Eighteen and they erected it on the national mall in Washington DC the following day Christine Blasey Ford Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee about sexual assault allegations stemming from their time in high school\n\nNow keep in mind those who supported this arch say that it represents freedom and peace however the truth is\n\nIt's a replica of an orange there was a gateway to hell\n\nIt was the entry to the temple dedicated to the guy to power sexual ...

ruled by the anti Christ or the jaw or or whomever\n\nI mean this is a program obviously a program of apocalypse a program of eschatology we talked about it when we have the rabbi on the program we talked about it we had Paul Begley on the program\nWe talked about it with the blood moons we talked about it with the red hat for all of these things are part to jar the wiring of what we have inside of us thinking that the end of the world is coming and observers that don't know the background of the arch or any of this they all say well this is just a coincidence\n\nBut such a coincidence is bizarre because this\nArch of bail being being wrecked it there on the Washington DC mall just the day before the testimony was delivered by Brett Kavanaugh\n\nThere was a guy with him Sheldon Whitehouse the senator from Rhode Island you asked the question about the devil's triangle and what it meant oh everybody was talking about oh\nIt's a sexual practice Brett Kavanaugh said no it's three glasses at a triangle he had a different interpretation of everybody thought ha this is about some perverse sexual acts\nMatter what the definition is whether it was [noise] personalized by

but then I look at it and say this could all be one big show that they're putting on to scare me or just scare everyone else\nBut it just seems to be working all the plots all of the dark arts\nAll

material world within the conspiracy history\nWe always seem to point to whomever we hate has control over the world the spiritual realm\nBut what is it the thriving right now and then it's globalization a lot of frightening and somewhat complex beings that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back and read and understand that's why I come in every day\nEarly\nAnd yeah you can go through all of the bad guys the masons ... accusing them of controlling all the spiritual realms of what appears to be the same trio called however it becomes more complicated\n\nWhen you deal with witchcraft or pre scrap that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of this I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it\nBecause of what I studied my my entire life what I Would I put into this program every night every major step in the development of the new world order from a simple ideology to a worldwide super

if you want to uh be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards disorder you can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\n\nThat kind of alluded to it in the last hour I use the the word synergy\nThere was a guy by the name of a Joseph ... say knives\nAnd he had an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century\nAnd to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that is pre destined to rule absolutely at odds with what you've been emerging concepts of democracy and so he decided to the only way to win\nAnd to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so he wanted to transmit the secret synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual bought his district are key were of course the knights Templar and other groups that you don't actually spawned and and and new ideas and and

nurses in attendance and\nUh you know prize giveaways and I'm a lot of ... a lotta corny stuff uh but those shows used for wall they would travel and it pretty much was the birth of the midnight movie because you know the the theaters didn't want to give up your eight o'clock movie or their ten o'clock movie\nSo um you know the the the people who are four walling they what they were five or theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie\nAnd they they they would rent the theater out a after hours and they would show these uh shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted an actor\nOr an sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they did have matinees for kids\nTo 'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out and they would have looming asked him ghosts made out of a ... that were didn't phosphorus and and they would they would uh you know\nThey would have these changes that would be wrapped through the bleachers and they would react with them back and forth and it would make all the chairs vibrate and they'd all these great uh you know that they would be that they were put weird statement which strings and ice water and throw them out in the audience and they go down to the back of people's shirts and people will be feeling it's cold\nNoodle going down the back of their shirt\nYou know um it was so many fun kind of carnival type gimmicks these guys did and they would go from town to town town and sometimes they do three movies back to back um with all these great gimmicks there'd be mature share and I show act\nYou know people putting nail through our nose and all that stuff\n[noise] what's the appeal of the Rocky Horror picture show remember without\nA job so lovely absolutely I think that that did have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nPeople have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen or you know there's rice thrown during the wedding and I think it's sort of immersive experience but I also think because of the sexuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and are kind of emerging into their adult life\nIt's kind of an ... thing that they can go into with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little scanner so [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you\nKnow people who who met met each other a sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adults and I've heard as I've I've seen that that I've seen the shadow cast in the states or a performance that goes along with the movie performing very you're very different markets all over the country\nAnd over and over again I flew people who have met at that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but you definitely find your people if you if you really are into that\nHouston, Texas we go Robert's with us on coast to coast hey Robert go ahead sir\nGood morning George and Mr Lovell either like you would call and I'm sure enjoy the show thank you I'm I'm fifty one years old and I haven't been to a\nTheater so it's about three years ago when I went to see a rush the ... the Canadian band they're dom\nOkay interesting do you have a couple of really quick thing the shining is a fantastic\nA horror movie anything that um [noise] who who was it that way and Mr blend the movie where Stanley Kubrick Danica Patrick ... obscene Bible and the good movies in every one of them were fantastic\nUh what was done in our age range love clockwork orange they're all amazing yes um well you mentioned earlier in the best movie I ever saw Frank Sinatra him was the Manchuria candidate\nHe did well there you did very well very well that was a fantastic it was a pretty good actor\nHe really was it really is the um that um [noise] ... that just had so many twists and at that you you didn't know about the way but for some diabolical [noise]\nAh one other thing who first horror movies that really scares me and I now days I I still have to see one occasionally okay and they're not my favorite\nBut I was about ten years old and my grandmother's house everybody was in bed and I had to turn the TV done very low IQs lay on the floor but to be from it you'll be able to hear it but where everybody was bleeding and it was called um black Sunday [noise] [noise]\nOh yes with Boris Carl off\nActs and right I remember that what was the one called Black Christmas or something like that\nThat was Black Christmas a with a that was a Bob Clark who went on to direct a Christmas Story of both [laughter] but why Christmas uh there was a a a a a killer that was terrorizing sorority sisters who all lived in the same house\nAnd she he was calling them from inside the house\nOh ah that's where we'd be that's creepy\nUh and uh but uh there was also yeah it's it's a very creepy film a really well made structured horror film John facts and it's amazing in it and it's um a template for a lot of those kind of movies from the seventies\nAnd like I said that guy went on to make quirky [laughter] you went on to make a Christmas Story a lot or a lot of other films in different genres\nBut somebody will some of these movies Mr mobile are are creepy they're not pure horror but they're creepy there was one with the uh Beau Bridges I Believe in his ... his wife went in to a fast food place or like a like a quick good shop\nA and never came back out he couldn't find her and apparently a truck driver had kidnapped or um and I was\nJust really well done movie and you know you know I'm not that I you know it sounds that sounds familiar\nAnd they buried they ended up burying him a because the you know the truck driver says do you want to know what happened to your wife do you really want to know and they knocked him out a it was called the vanishing\nOkay yeah yeah I've heard of that moment actually seeing that\nSkis or ... was a Beau Bridges your keys or sell Sutherland they I think they were both on to keep you know it was good stuff but Mr mobile were on a time but we got to get your back again my friend Jeff Bridges was in that movie the vanishing Mr mobile with us next we're going to

Fox News emotions running high in Washington as a key vote on Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh approaches\n\nAnd all come back to goes to goes Dr Merrill Lynch looks back with his PHD social anthropologist writers speaker\nHas been a leader in the field of consciousness studies for more than three decades Dr ... serves as a president a mirror to send a senior fellow at the Institute of ... sciences at the lead gr Mitchell's from Beijing\nAnd her latest work it just makes life possible revolutionary insights on living dying in the continuation of consciousness and Marilyn welcome back good to have you again\nThank you George it's great to be here and how are you what's new\nI'm Glad it's been a wild ride I think that we're living in extraordinary times and you know and that just trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing how does that happen\n[noise] well it started when I was a rebellious kid in Detroit\nAnd feeling like I wanted to change the world but had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with a closing time and the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk\nDriver through my body off the\nMotorcycle and um I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggest that any way that consciousness is more than just our physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my leg\nYou know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... Japanese and being a good NPR assist which means you investigate everything\nWould you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember them on it\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table my God and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrinking\nI drank it and that causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand\nConsciousness somebody once you were wrong I\nGuess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked at all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know well\nI was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference\nThere family still there\nI have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motor motorcycle accident\nUh-huh you're born I really yeah well you\nTell me where cars you must remember there's the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who was ... was it a busy street yeah it was a busy street\nBut it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\n... I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes\nYou'll remote feeling now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill new Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your back here my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nSuited ... really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected a vice president of the Psychological Association will get into that but is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and what time versus the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown yeah um well I discovered to books when I got\nInto college and the first one was Thomas Kuhn book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this\nYou know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nOut here in that regard and\nI didn't apply for the job at no at sciences but it was about Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe she'll feel university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of\nNotion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough the understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is any relationship between the family\nWell you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery which you'll remember\nI remember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit the or at least last time I checked\nDo they do they still college which we're you know and I know I haven't really an gobbled up it's been a yeah I'm sure\nRight all the micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about\nDeath experiences above the other side what ... what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUh now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing and they proceeded to complete that their money and went in and followed the music and it was that radio\nAnd his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe that for something more and his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important to as a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic watch per se\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests where the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker\nI think so too and it's a ...

approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI think can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no Jew no gr Mitchell before you know so\nYeah very well regarded worked with him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did\nWith him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving unkind toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that's you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nWe're descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death\nIf you are like quarter law\nMhm she knew this was challenged ducts which challenged could you prove that there's life after\nThis wouldn't make a great reality show\nLove Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you

with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but employees with all this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWhy I think\nAgain we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called in attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level and to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that\nOffers us a point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true do you
