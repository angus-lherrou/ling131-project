the United states is starting to resemble some sort of a dystopian a Ninety maybe for those df ski a position by demons type of thing um in fact I brought up those ... says story\nOr when I did my

uh it was a certainly you know ... the thing that I had to stay out again and do work\nOr because of the fact that uh they needed someone to go wall to wall and I'm not complaining because I I Want to

of the people the silencing of those people who are putting forth to the fired state power that would happen\nYou know they went and they shut down they shut down the you know the printing presses they shut down or you know journalists silencing people their free speech the freedom of the press everything taken from them and little by little information became scarce and the result was a\nFerocious anger that erupted in several fires destroyed the main city\nThen came the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge war\nOr young people

solidly adapt to intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a\nOf a you know groups that are are supposed to represent neo Nazis and fascists and and then we have the anti fascist and the left wing on borough of its shades communism and and all these factions fighting together thinking there's one side of the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within both sides\nEverybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore\nI mean what are your conscious of it or not\nYou can say that doing this dividing and fighting as anti liberty it really turns out to be very difficult for the media to understand her except that's why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters the hour they never say who they are\nI've never I mean maybe I can find someplace by every time I have never heard anti far being spoken up by the media\n\nAnd you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in anti ...\nBut there's also others and you know\nWe have to learn and we have to remember that there are two main dangers to liberty right now one that comes from

they called the blue the kite balloons kite demeaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accent of murder and violence and the others would follow suit\n\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue type going on and and the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kites and we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and and uh and fighting\n... this is this is how we do terrorism American style this is how we do civil and civility or instability was reduced incivility uh American style\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up I mean there's got to stand there and wait kind of a referee between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps of do see fc we're following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us this way I mean given all we know about what's going on\nAnd given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it treats the citizens like faceless statistics\nAnd economic units three bought sold a barter traded in track\nIt lies the system lives it cheats it steals it spies it kills breaks laws over reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn and they love to violent\nTheir empire so what they do is they create wars they they ah\nThey take over everything they they're they're swallowing up everything little by little\nSo we have is deep state that is a myth superpower ... worldwide deep state of global industrial deep state\nAnd so it might get like you know network where uh the mid ... he says there are no Russia's there are no countries there are no ... there is no west there's only one organized system systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's ... that's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nAnd that's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we we were first afraid of\nTerrorists now we're afraid of each other we're afraid of the rising up rising up of the middle eastern terrorists now it's us but needs to be careful because you know we have a fourth estate it's failed us\n\nAnd and what they have is they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence may want you to speak politically correct speech politically been dismissive talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we for fifty one people that we don't like\nWe burn the books in the same places we burn people\nAnd it's because of the global establishment has risen up against the people and the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nAnd we have a large number of people that always cannot be got be happy with themselves in let's say pressure other ... other people into believing the whims of of of the deep state or believe in the whims of this ... solution or this course of project to get people angry at one another but see in the end\nIn the end we're all terrorists to one another all mean to one another somebody's gonna step and say well you got to clean house\n\nWe got to clean house we got to make this place say because everybody is at each other's throats that we've got to go in and we got to get everybody to play nice we needed an intervention of some ...\nYou know we do that with other countries\nWe did that with other countries ... you know we always see going suddenly going on in Iran or Iraq and we see a civil war we step and we sending soldiers we tried to clear up the problem\nAnd how would you feel if we all are fighting like we are right now and shyness as you know what there's a problem we gotta send troops there to take care of the United states and when they're done they're going to thank us for what they've done for them\nThat's how vulnerable we are that that's how fragile we are you realize is that if someone decides that we're just at each other's throats too much they decide they just want to walk in and clean house they will\nAnd boy you won't like that will you will be fighting against one enemy or will be

in corporations and I don't know how you find I find that it's worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that uh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together agreeing with the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order that wants to take over to go to Jack in California hijacked you're on ground zero\nSo high Clyde yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things that just didn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name ...\n... like I had done to show gets ... junkie show ...\n... you\nKnow you had a [noise] the Turks came out ...\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise]\nWell if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stop them so I think you have a the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of\nAny nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill him and the more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true\nBut Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections\nAnd they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you could see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket it would have an immediate effect on the economy\nAnd it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this as a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide deep state manipulation\nIt is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump it's about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence with this ... this happening\nAnd and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust well\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wish it were to look at\nAnother indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral could be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ... is a Saudi citizens and he was actually\nIn a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states has no consequences for the president states has really no authority\nTo retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watch him get pressured to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to leak the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and they flew his remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh they moved out of the country\nSlide if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it will\nProbably do the same reason or you say they used in ah he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can't get in there and embassy and do anything about it\nWell but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey are making the argument the CIA was a ... operation deep played opportunity argument that he said operatives in the high a score facilitators to the murder of this uh uh of of cars Yogi\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian ah that'd be said operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too\nBut what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more can be give the Trump is pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia and\nThe thing that I have a feeling we do need to do that well I

friend the coast to coast am of courts and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here I'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group or their motto was try that that just one more try\nAnd that's really been my and form a motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members that caught\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group [laughter] outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith Sam says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group to the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the bureau of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places but they were doing it with defensive just asking themselves what is out\nAre how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of this original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday or we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause it if I Believe that if\nYou walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this and I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math\nAnd what do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book in which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a fought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of ... the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect\nSo my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives\nOf other ... before you came on and use that he was in Israel in of course great Mentalist\nAnd it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved in and the guy missed it or something like\nThat and now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I even when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor I've and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know Edgar Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program was talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class\nIn the ... or or type pin\nAnd he lost it and you couldn't find it and he was telling a story about it in and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping and it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the the part that class ... into the the pointed at the end of it\nYeah was in ... ice cream [laughter]\nYellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing villa in there for that [laughter]\nJust amazing but back to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but nothing too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nAnd in a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum and\nMy contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect\nHowever one of my favorite teachers never God or to great teacher in the mind power tradition teaches that the only way that you can project\nNegatives spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else\nIf he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I thought they really have to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical researched quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nI like what station and my listening to right now news radio one thousand K T o K [noise]\nColleges and

coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIn seems to work doesn't\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my monitor is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positive mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've\nActually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all don't\nTell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it\nAnd when the results arrive express things that is a method we can all do it is easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy ... the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty\nArriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things that coalesce around one name has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really\nNail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected I've done television narrating\nAnd and and and written many books and articles\nIncluding in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nWhere you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period is also necessary\nIt is amazing we're kind of people get this membership into the miracle glide the\nMiracle club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member in the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me\nAnd I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take you to my website and my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you could sign that you could folded laminated carry it in your wallet it's just something fun to have with you\nTo sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card\nA designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or which of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories it is overwhelming you\nKnow we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where\nWe get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our minds play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected and all reasonable circumstance\nWill come back with calls next on coast to coast the mind of ... and I

Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down a goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity is the one that hidden he behind every health health program with it\nSomething won't work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that can be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener\nIs whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\n[noise] interesting work Mitch or what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this all on your own\nDough all on my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental human tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are strive for is all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend in New England who was recovering\nFrom a very serious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left to his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading a book George that I Know you are very deeply\nThe magic of believe yes and loved though yeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happened to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents his old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollars\nIn the ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like a miracle\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah\nIt's exactly what he experienced and was quite recent\nThat when you least expect it you know\nYes yes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up with these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on it and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take in twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you absolutely\nAbsolutely I think that if you can get yourself into a quiet meditative state

feel those wrongs\nIn your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple thing and then run that seeing through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple thing in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders and you always need to bring it back\nIf you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you got a promotion at work\nIn time and time
