think\nWell the flu season is your new in Ireland and discussing the flu for six years now and it gets even more confusing or the ... flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on me if the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us that a hundred and Seventy five children died last year but fifty percent of those had preexisting conditions\nYou look on the flip side twelve thousand children died in accidents like cars fires and so forth the confusion gets even worse when um the vaccine last year was only thirty four percent effective\nAnd now they've come out with a loving flu vaccines on the market and the CDC has picked up the shop\nGun and fired away too many hey use any one of these vaccines I don't like that do you oh no not at all or because you're drug store may be offering a vaccine would should be the cheapest one they can get a hold of that's\nTrue there is no ... no one vaccine for everybody

you know nobody is interested in his drinking behavior they were making an allegation of sexual assault if there was no corroborating evidence even among the witnesses chi man\nAnd this is over and

I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that sounds\nA bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology on going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that plays turned out to be here is if the one in\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving\nThem to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah file I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\nThat if they were going to come back here\nThese beings that ancient alien a theorist talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the history\nChannel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to and slave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics and our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slavery was it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide in other words\nAnd again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know callers on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un you know what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knew something at the time\nBut when you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed\nInfections were related to run as well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who go snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep I mean there is something to this idea\nThat we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders\nBut there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see the possible examples like I'm perhaps present thing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff sadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating effect\nUh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah fake it which this Saturday it's October the thirteenth this is going to be my final wishing machine

Halloween trivia year Halloween is an annual holiday ... celebrated each year on October thirty first originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Saddam Hussein when people would light bonfires and work costumes to ward off ghosts\nAnd the evening before was known as all Hallows eve and then later Halloween there's an interesting Josh [noise]\nIt absolutely is I mean did it goes back thousands of years and um I I think Fallon was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time with of course they were\nWrong you know reaping the rewards of harvest but preparing for the call the month of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning\nInto the cold dead time\nThere was a period where the the bill was so thin in fact the Europeans often talk about what they call Finn places the boundary with soaked in between where we are and where the spirits are that we can encounter each other for at least one or two nights and ... and interact with each other\nAnd the good part was well some of your loved ones might come through but then there were also all of these creepy evil being the crew and so you you'd where I'm at\nSo do you blend in with evil ones and they'd be like oh you're one of us\nYou know and and they they wouldn't harm you but from a more um I I think updated point of view George this also happens to be the time of year when a here in our part of the world\nThe earth is shifting away from the sun and so that means not only does it get colder and darker as we built in to that mysterious back a black boy the space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as a strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun and therefore subtle things that might otherwise\nBeen sort of drowned out in the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a eyes shine a flashlight at towards you outside on a bright sunny day well you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it on a dark night\nRight and so what happens in general is still there but it's still there it's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this is\nThe time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with these spirits another paranormal entities are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also in Hampton this because we're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for more\nLet's

to him but I just said you know anyway I ah I went I was late getting as so I had to sit in the back of the church was packed and services going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the ... through the check and I looked up and it was my uncle had just passed away\nAnd and he\nTold me he said John ... your car and I was shot at it and what to do and then again you said John don't value car when I was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone\nBut still I was ... and ...\nAnd so I got her at home with a friend of mine and the next morning I called my cousin which was the son and it has to wait and asked you to it and then bringing my collectively and I get him right back home he shouldn't matter though so he and his girlfriend got my car and that's over the cage full ...\nAnyway he a guy in my\nCar when they pull that that ... hit my truck and they they want to but they were extremely you know injured hurt I mean they had ... votes and but\nI never told me like this and that was really a lot to say anything about it with a dead till two of my close friends and um I don't let it way than not\nWith the show they have the I guess you know up until now I haven't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know well I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nSaid you didn't they didn't get ... theory on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they would be and you get my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was the only time I have a ... like a safe stage goes to get all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in more than you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks who among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits and the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see\nThe future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that there is more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover my\nDefinitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull

became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck\nStarted hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here and you know\nRobert was winding back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the\nWord has now spread for so long that if you go to see how\nYou have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences

Katie Hoff or log in\nAnd I'm cleaning and I'm often it's called the day room you know where the ... people come they do activities and all of a sudden I say this will nine year old boy I Would say\nMaybe ten eloquently I cooked steamed directly straight you know just that core I perfectly and he's looking at me and I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit you really show theirselves\nAnd he wasn't supposed to be there was\nI I don't think so I talked to the CNA in a\nCouple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there by\nTheir cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys\nThink 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full moon I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\n... do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they ... from what we understand no owned have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf Illinois in ... where do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to when I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah so that means there is a larger buildup of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around similar to when you're drag your\nSocks on the carpet and touched the door knob and there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electrodes data charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible field around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that this\nTime of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that reminds you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife you see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together\nAnd certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky ... or at very least metaphysical\nJosh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of that goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar that ah\nI every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mysteries the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating foul and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited it I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your uh then again one

point one\nAnd he writes the anti matter column which looks at\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine uses his experience in journalism and his interest and both go slower and the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that\nWas a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up yeah\nThank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story on Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday exponential I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it is kicking off the year I Lived this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher\nAnd initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to ... go stories with\nYou know tales of sacred in cities and and forty entails so a hunted World War two it turned in to be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military haunting as opposed to regular kind\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before\nA university ... stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music\nThere is there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two goes for 'em and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought\nA the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research haunted World War two was that um [noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm In history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories\nAnd I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past but sometimes it's\nA perfect in history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops enormous during the Normandy invasion but you know I found myself looking looking at those types of details\nSo I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to a little bit corn\nOh we're customs less than ones and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg we know is that right I'm sure there are other battlefield that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they say that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ... now on the other hand there there are some a theorist that also say that\nYou know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one playing to the next that's\nThat's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nLose their own specific battlefield that you would say is the most talented a bowl\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say ah Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories are especially\nIn it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers ... they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately recognize these uniforms this German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away\nBut then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw and he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and uh his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the R D end battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle the ball ...\nJust to like that yeah yeah\nLike they want to do a different time warp or something right\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are a ghost plane stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they\nWere starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a ... you make it sound went overhead and then just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes\nPlanes to be seen I bet they handled hundreds of them were

was ... a professor at occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that ah what he witnessed was a huge object\nThat was pretty much just standing at it sitting still in the middle of the uh right above the ocean that these\nGuns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a to me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerve\nCell in and they shot against the Matthew people could hear ... sounds yeah and we're hitting something\nRight this this person actually said some of the shelves were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swaying with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book after you\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your uh a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so\nThe interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships you had ... ah aircraft carriers\nAnd they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap it uh luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um\nShips those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call them shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented\nA ship based a haunted sites\nAre there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there um and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book\nSo yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved um and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seem to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy\n... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element of uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies\nJust seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed\nUm to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew Swain we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to ... as a ghost\n... well there are definitely go stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few a video anomalies\nWhen a when I Believe his brother I Believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they so Michael Jackson walk up behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former ... home owned by Michael Jackson who claimed to hear music coming out of it at odd times\nWhen there shouldn't be anybody at home so that definitely a\nMichael Jackson coasts have been seen\nThere are starting right now a lot more good stories about prince who just died I think\nBack in two thousand sixteen I'm\nHis Paisley Park has his recording studio several of the workers there claimed to hear people shuffling\nAround the hear voices fans have also blogged about how they believe like they had an encounter with that goes to\nPrint out they seem to be everywhere will come back we'll talk more about some of these haunted rock and roll stories and take some calls next on the coast to coast Dale\nJoined the coast to coast am Facebook page with thousands of members Greek for show updates and to do with other ...

with us Matthew I'm you know Hitler as sick as he was was also interested in the ... did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I came away with a a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold ah you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life\nBut what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there will people have have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too but it sounds like Hitler's early\nA philosophy was influenced by a cult groups like the whole society in the ...\nSociety very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area\nBut what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power\nAnd so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of it is a cult groups he starts to go after fortune tellers and astrologers so I came away with a little bit of a different opinion\nOn the cold in in Nazi Germany\nUh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the cult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so\nThere were the wiccan in England who uh try to get together to uh spiritually or go after the Nazi regime or they held um meetings in the ... got together\nWith the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em and Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch or with\nUh the allied a new thought ... a movement those are a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved into trying to use spiritual techniques a cult techniques to stop Hitler from uh from succeeding\nSo those were a different ways that a ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lotta people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot so I go into a ah some of these stories with really preconceived notions\nAnd then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I I Try to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is that I'm really when I started writing hunter rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times uh\nAnd uh you know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing of the country book and revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... a came away with is the thought that\nMusic is really just to consciousness raising tool ah it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of\nUm historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician\nThat I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and the like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded a haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories in these tales of the supernatural usually start out fanned fan musician to musician a person that witnesses it\nTalks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site so it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good ghost stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces and they sold the parts and apparently they were haunted\n[noise] yeah that's a ... the name of his car yeah he um he\nHad a car it was a poor spider uh wasn't involved in Iraq and then\nA pieces of it because it wasn't really a race car a pieces of it were salvaged and I know there's one story about um a a one race car driver used a piece in his car and a car fell on them and I think crushed him to death\nBelieve it or not there's a parallel to that in the haunted World War two book there was a\nI think it was a beat twenty four the crash landed in the desert of North Africa pieces of it were recovered are that are now in the national I think air force a museum\nA and pieces of that plane were report it to be cursed in that uh I think some of the pieces went went into a\nA a a plane that later crashed I think a couple of planes crashed based on and so so there is a connection\nAll right let's take some calls here for you Matthew let's pick it up by going to Frank in Hollywood, Maryland again to start in any Frank\nYou're back with you when you made any subject India I I I I think you know there are some things at the\nUh uh and not the Nazi Germany but what about\nA place where people were murdered by by not uh\nI watch a film where they were shot three hundred shot down over there they were shot down a credible what was found\nAnd I'm Wondering if any any hunting and in a remote places where you're not you're not take my answer off\nAir okay ...\nThanks for that that's a that's a great question and I believe I Know exactly which\nWhich footage you're talking about and believe it or not one of the stories that I came across a is I think from that area because I I Believe that might have been taken in Poland Czechoslovakia and there are stories about some of the victims of the Jewish victims of those atrocities\nUm that still hunters areas again I I I found out of a difference for those those people that I Would leave them out of the book and and wouldn't try to try to um\nYou know be looked at like I was making any money from that so I I left that out but yeah definitely those stories crop up and I guarantee you if you were in those areas\nYou would find a lot of go slower a lot of folklore and a lot of good stories about
