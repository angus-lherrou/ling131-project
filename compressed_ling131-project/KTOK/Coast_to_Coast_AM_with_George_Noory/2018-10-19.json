I mean let's just not do that Rick thanks for wedding you're on the market then show in Ferguson filling in and I go ahead\n[noise] hey Ben thanks for having me on a a a really enjoy your show fate thank you had a quick\nQuestion I'm trying to gain some a little bit of understanding and and I I mean I Know deep down what the answer is but from a logical standpoint let us know few years ago Mr Obama\nFederal suit against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce immigration laws they successfully argued that\nImmigration was a full per per view of the federal government [noise]\nWell now we go back and at that time ... the state of California and a few other states joined with the federal government to win that argument\nWell no that Mr Trump is they're trying to actually enforce immigration laws some of these same states are suing saying oh wait we can do our own thing as well such as California with the uh [noise] a sanctuary cities yet\n... it's ... it's because it's when they don't they ... people need to understand about liberals\nThey don't have a set of values they stick with its the values I think at that moment will help them the most that's the reason why they're willing to do whatever I mean there are millions you a liberal it's easier to be a Democrat in politics because no one will ever criticize you for for ...\nNo one will ever criticize you for doing one thing or saying one thing one day one day during the complete opposite the next day me in\nThe ... is the part where I'm confused as is it is what the court to sit there and argue the whole the whole notion of story to the east coast and stuff like this yet those same courts are stepping back when in reality they're decisions don't stand ...\nWell you got to remember we're talking about ten years ago when Obama was talking about enforcing the border and that that issue Democrats thought was less popular to be anti border security now they're they have to go all in on it Rick because if they don't eventually I think they'll keep losing the Republicans like Donald Trump\nThey need new voters in here and they need to give out amnesty and they need to do a quick and if you had to enter the I mean we could take cruises a perfect example with his best to raise if all the illegal immigrants in Texas could vote Ted Cruz will be done\nOh absolutely absolutely\nAnd and you could argue that there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win Texas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us to when you got to win Florida because you're never going to win California well if you can turn\nTexas to them for the Dems those three states\n... it's virtually impossible to do math that makes it were Republican to win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just skip the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you've got it the same way that you have it in California the same exact way\nThe way we got some very important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious commentators she was just on MSNBC deadline and White House and she had some very um insightful words and commentary and an hour\nIt's about the two thousand mid term to make the midterms elections here is Rosie O'Donnell the liberal or the day with some great advice that analysis for this upcoming election listen to this\nHe's doing that to scare every journalist here who recall that the people that we all know he's doing that right here's a guy who was tortured and killed a journalist who was badly of test them and\nHe doesn't respond why I'm sure that's what three to think what could have possibly do to air journalist from not printing bad news about it which is also equivalent to the truth about\nSo now Donald Trump wants to kill American journalists\nPer Rosie o'donald\nAnd doesn't want to stay and wants to scare journalists are Donald says he's doing that to scare every journalist here who recalls enemy of the people as we all know he's\nDoing that here's a guy who was who was tortured and killed a journalist and this is Donald Trump sweat dreamed is Carol journal is the same way [noise]\nSet on fire you know and I I don't know what I can do I'm done Marco then we'll be back with you on Monday it's always great to spend some time with

found a lot of great advice on how to quit smoking and picked out the ways I thought it would work best for me\nI started my setting a quit date then I throughout my ashtrays lighters and matches I did other things too like exercising more and it worked but I still get cravings\nEspecially on long car rides to help me with that I put a picture of my mother and my car she died of lung cancer from

without letting anyone know but secretly tucked away and all of our utility drawers he's a tin foil hat that will probably where it because we know that no one truly lives of the universe is fully objective\n\nI mean what we're seeing limited concepts of time we're hearing about how there are different dimensions we're hearing about there are different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all paranormal\nAnd they want to quantify all the paranormal in a scientific way scientific way like ah they want to be halfway with their religion they want to eat half way with the conscious if they want to do ... and this is where I've spoken to bore about how\nHere we are going to ship this ... this is a a major paradigm shift and we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happen or we perceive they do\nAnd then later we're schooled on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know it was done exactly what is that somehow we reach a point\nWhere we're satisfied with their opinion and then all of that it's based on his ball nebulous stimuli we all agree to this and it's like this is my opinion and this is my truth and you say\nWell it's not truth which just what you think it is the it's all about your selective perception\nAnd we know that selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception we wouldn't be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light light like love survival spirituality God you know\n[noise] and then we're exposed to a media print television Internet videogames cell phones many other things that you know that are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right then and then compartmentalized area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we learned that in old age would boost\nMemory and we lose perception of time\nI mean the brain can be objective if it chooses to however it's emotion that is driving these guys and so there's this war going on between the brain\nAnd subjective experience and this is what they call explanatory gap where we've\nHad to bridge the brain conscious fist experienced emotion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experience is worth feeling it all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\nAnd of course now we experienced virtual meaning hyper reality from electronic allusion it's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people\nResponding to the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch brings a you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script but it is to follow the follow their own hearts follow their own mind\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting fatigue right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually describes as the nature of the truth giving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue is provided by the party and it's never ending propaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing\nMany people who live there not had the the time nor the guess desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nAh by George Orwell usually but you know they say things like a big brother's watching you right ha ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones were groomed to follow the which is the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world where the government had corrupted the language forced the citizenry to believe live as if it were true and they were being tracked with you\nThey could just tell the screen it was basically extent in every home place of business in public facility today we ... our hands they are virtually every communication device so you're the first thing we look at in the morning there the last thing we see at night\n\nThey are programming the masses with emails music can beams and with every algorithm we're slowly being coerced into following anything that seems to be calling her confirmation bias\nSo this process we're not only beginning to wonder if someone is watching us we're also noticed that somebody is scripted nuts or at least ... some people and acting like\nWhat are now being called non player characters the non player characters are NBC's or the newest beamed and it appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nNow\nNBC is a me there are there are and the season games gamers knowing NBC's are\nOkay a\nActual NBC's or computer controlled characters in video games with limited scripted responses I'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's be assigned missions to a player like in skyrim\nOr they joined the players a companion like in fall out but they create is NBC mean\nAnd what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or mock what it's called left wing propaganda and I think\n... cleverly I I think it's being used cleverly ... what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\nWhere it's like not being overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC me mocks leftist and they make it the base of getting expressionless face this kind of like a\nA statement face and it it ... and and you can see these things on Twitter read it in fortune and over the weekend twin responded by suspending more than Fifteen hundred accounts associated with the NBC name as they claim it violated the terms of service mainly intentionally misleading election related content\nSeveral months ago unfortunate and read it online you know where you go to look at messages on the porch and read it they started using the term M. P. C. three for the liberals and these people said well they said that you know they joined the anti Trump crowd because they're sheep\nThey're brainwashed she that's what they believe in and they'd been conditioned to parrot left wing orthodoxy in the manner of scripted characters so you look at one of these in PCs they're basically this crudely drawn great cartoon avatar has a pointy noses in the blank face\nAnd it's just like a stick figure face in fact if you remember back in Nineteen eighty four when apple had their little commercial about ah the computer and all these people are sitting the masses we're seeing that they're all bald and kind of like staring like zombies that's exactly what they fit\nSexual symbol of at that sort of big brother drone image of us [noise] so uh [noise]

frantic\nAnd they said this stop please\nI did not believe in magic at first I thought it was all a big joke then Trump won the primary and I thought hey that's a coincidence then he became the candidate and I thought things were getting weird now Hillary he's\nGetting sick again I Know you noticed she's she's been coughing and they've been getting it on on on\nOn TV lately\nAnd the thing is is that this all goes back to Pepe the frog\nWhich was a character that they were using to a ... that was I guess a precursor to the un PC\nAnd they're saying you're you are at being with the fabric of reality this is black magic please stop you are\nHappening with powers you don't understand if you keep this up you could miss all out of existence [laughter] Chris geo I I mean is this a form of\nBlack magic I mean I thought about that you know I never did talk about Pepe the frog and the reason why is because I knew exactly the frog represented a lot of people have mixed mixed feelings about ... ... was another one of these meetings where they used to be to represent a lot of things from racism to what have you it was kind of a ... he was just a stupid frog but it was a menacing\nWas a medicine type of me now they have the monkey ill at this balding it looks like actually one of the characters that I was too crowded it it kind of dreamed up\nWell\nYou know what's interesting is um it's central magic as you mentioned before and essential is when an outcome Mr Black magician will take a series of letters or symbols\nAnd you may not necessarily recognize them but I noticed that this Pepe the frog guy he was he was drawn very strangely just like these NBC's\nThe NBC means are drawn very strangely now I'm not that familiar with the cold symbolism but I'm pretty sure that if you look at ... work or something like that you can find something similar with a similar type of symbol that's being blasted on the human consciousness 'em over and over and over again\nAs a matter of fact I'm Crowley how to spell than it used to do and this was something that he was very famous for him he\nUsed to be able to take control of the body of one of these and PCs and he was why there's a story of him walking down the street with a some prime minister or something like that and he says watch this and he points to the guy in front of him any needles down and the guy in front of him starts kneeling down almost as he is controlling them like a puppet\nNow if one person can do this and matching what's going on through the Internet through the mainstream media so on and so forth and people have lost their ability to think I mean if I can take a political here for just a moment I'm coming into this\nSelection I've just been so jaded by the oligarchy that we've had that I thought that you know it's just going to be the same BS coming through the pike and then when Trump got it I was still a little skeptical but I'm looking at Trump\nAnd thinking wow I Can't find any fault in this guy I mean you know I don't agree with everything he does but considering what we've had in the past Trump is has actually done a really good job the only thing I can fault him for is that he likes to eat a steak well done with ketchup which to me I think should be an impeachable offense to ruin an iguana fake like\nThat but yeah I mean you look at his behaviors and by the ... times but you know he's the president and I mean president that act that way before I mean Bush act like one Cheney was a bigger one I mean I mean Cheney for president\nBut the thing is we're not voting at a personality were voting in somebody you can be the commander in chief and that's what I look at it or not we you know everybody wants to have that swab personnel I mean we had that and we had that in spades with with the with a rock Obama\nBut I'm just saying it it was just something that ah\nYou know I guess Trump doesn't have he doesn't have that same swab charisma you like this down and dirty ugly guy wants to get stuff done but I Am really really interested in this in this angle about how these beams or whatever they are that's with NBC character\nHas gone from being this

been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up\nAnd he has this meeting at the er at the White House and what I saw was the dissolve meant of the less agenda 'em to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against ... that I Will not repeat on this brought the N. word but it\nIt go ... and ... to show how the script all of a sudden changed what it All right\nHave you ... did you see the the the there was a traffic it was being blocked in Portland the anti ... members were blocking and directing traffic well guy pulls up in a car and some guy who was holding a plate of tacos I don't know why but he was with the group\nAnd he started yelling at the guy goes you look like a Whitey

calling ... n word that can read his what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happens is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed with so um you were talking about numbers and number ... symbolism\nAnd numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this too and I'm\nFrom what direction do we break this down in

I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving the reading [noise]\nThe question I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you're here you should be able to tell them that's the first half the legitimacy of what you are receiving\nI knew I had already yellow or on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers who are others who are critical of him say that he's just a great\nMagician and and I told them I ... I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons a magically if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal ... I Believe he started out doing magic trick that many of these wonderful psychic do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a they're six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately and it's kind of well close together you can't tell the difference\nBut it's wonderful that you're you're falling down frames and did you learn anything from that we're able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches them clocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] try to say that when you were growing up you didn't magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was a kid I mean I wasn't I was a really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think steered me\nInto the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed you know if I was a trick I was visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific\nAnd there there were some uh doubters who had\nCaptions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking it's so restrictive and limiting it to higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and be on\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interests or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because we're just supposed to be and growing in a consciousness of the kind of a\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers and listeners your birth month in days\nTo have a birthday and a first name possible short\nThey're asking about a fellow man to a lot about love and [laughter]\nAnd try to keep each call to about a minute nap or show if you can check out his because so many we'll\nWe'll cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't more and more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions or other\nPlanets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation as say a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and the religious voters\nAs a psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhen you say very strange about like um\nAre you picking on them are you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nBut I don't like going the cemetery I I don't like the energy there and people who are ... and they go to the cemetery frequently are pointing that person back to their grave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process\nIs really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief but you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person and good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right he was and\nThink about that we can wish them well if they're going to like God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had together and let them go I was going to the cemetery is very bad uh my\nMy parents were big cemetery ... hours as I was growing up is that a good work goer [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of a generation that went to the cemetery a lot you know and uh I found myself a cemetery is a great deal of growing up and at one point my parents\nWere pointing to a muscle am as we were driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom said she I think we should\nGet one of those and I think they were well at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here they'll play no they're not going to stay here back\nTo the thing is I started crying and what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here and they said no no no our from my mother explain more about that to me and that was very enlightening\nYou know I thought it was like a house on the I thought they were going to those crazy people [laughter] you know if I were if my dog and my bike\nI Love it there are a joy to do with us we'll come back and we'll take phone calls questions

[laughter] absolutely George George reminder\nAs a psychic where do you get your I'll call the power where'd you get it from\nI don't think it's power I oh God that ... where it really is the trafficking yeah a lot of people say that and I think only God has the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's absolutely free to call in I'm very happy to a ... and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from it's a life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath\nSo the energy is half for all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals joys and many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question oh it's all connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me is that night and he said you know mom I'm fine\n[laughter] and I don't want you to worry about me\nAnd when I lost my dog he came to me and the little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that mother\nSo animals and that's your question tried to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go\nBut they do have a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nAs I I don't want people to think the two sides that right you're supposed to go and you're supposed to go and\nYou know so a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\n... very sad\nYes don't do it [laughter] I\nKnow you asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have done ... ...\n... if the threat class and hit you a sense than your feeling that very intuitive so you can feel it presses or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh that's impressive\nSo if you're with the press and who's not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche\nVampires but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I tried to work with those people by the word Jewish I tried to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know how\nThat's a form of healing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of healing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... uh the ... billion a year and then if they want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate choice\nHere that will be grave however you run a judge I think that's\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris has been born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy October sixteen Nineteen Seventy Hey Chris welcome\nOh thank you didn't have happy birthday [laughter] I'm up to a much more than one\nOkay so ... tense exchange so you have a really wonderful new cycle beginning\nBut it has to do with creativity you have a question Chris\nOh I'm very much a creature routine and I just wanted to give their routines and our break his routine you're boring after a while\nYeah but here in Tampa that area's not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and uh do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\nI'm I'm ...

drawn into another world and where I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed back eventually opt to seeming to live a whole life of Ninety year old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThat there will be on the physical you know nine years old who do you talk about is you try to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something who could explained to me what happened in any way that made sense with an aboriginal kid for me\nThe digital this tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my co dissociation\nWas an ability to travel beyond the buddy drop when consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding is there a world beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell on the phone not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army and so we're moving all the time army brat situation not tell you one of the things that kept me going is amongst mind this book companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nCome and sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe're time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on and dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nWhere we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then and conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survived physical tests isn't it pretty pretty important area\nAh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious\nNot sold them going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my employer include but loving family members or ancestral spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about to get in contact information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely a time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen as one function of time travel we see the possible future\nCan reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out in other realities and all the time periods in\nThe multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S hand understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experience is papa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book ... absolutely and entirely from mine experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we didn't dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human kill human couches across history about dreams and dream of St believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like that\nYou can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest sold so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from Baton on more objective perspective then we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to the sin of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes a thon you can get it done in minutes you get some help with the fact that you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it the ... the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between ... states have consciousness between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch it means there's good times and Bachmann loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that\nOur actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nHere use radio one thousand gay deal games worldwide and I are radio [noise]\nHere's a decline in ... new ...

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nYeah I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name and there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to a head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean not introduce us hope themes about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat into sudden\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an age of the ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and that these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the attitude of the energy you're carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking ... waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into we at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter\nOf reality is a dense conscious so ... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discovery is that the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot and maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts to something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis\nHit but gosh are my blood is bode again it's ... ... you live in pants and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened I said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white creating can but the white queen screams before she ... she doesn't have to scream\nWhen she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Fort took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating the symptoms but he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you well you know I said so I think that we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it in all of a sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's a good story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to\nTake action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it it's also method of loose the dreaming you'd call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out lose to the state loose it what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay this romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes will come to you the full to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open\nWe got the how to look simplicity outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program and the method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret it might have to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't watch around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of helping healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find that\nBehind something that's scaring or worrying you and\nYour dream is a power power the understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or a life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou

[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast a dear friend Robert boss back with us as we talk about dreams will get your calls as well Robert you write about Carl young a lot in he even had some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's unfit choices joke in his dream life\nOh yes he was young young was inspired by dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflections that he has interesting thoughts every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him\nAnd dream so here is a man I mean a titan of scholarship and science who is driven all his life by his dream a lot of the stories in my new book mysterious realities involves humans passage into the afterlife and actually what he might be doing now it's pretty interesting title\nBut the part of that is in the previous documentation is that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake on legs Oric\nWhich was called bowling get out the nearby village\nIs living in another bowling on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost all the or death you felt absolutely confident in certain he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in a story in a mysterious around his Coby out of the ball and gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlife situation on actually gives some insight into where how humans mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books or in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised but\nThat Robert his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself wrote a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the deposit that shaped your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood that one of the key things about dreaming is this that gives the U.S have the ability to understand what happens to a mind of consciousness off to death because it dreams as yoga understood\nReceive visitations from the prompted didn't dreams who made travel into the realms where they are at home ... very briefly one more thing about him and his relevance to this book in my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continue to live in other realities that we perceive and dreams so I'll dreams maybe memories of ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a ... because it negotiated through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price of surviving that in coming back and adding his science\nAnd his scholarship to what he knew first and about deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding with all the things we're talking about some of the great admirer of you\nWho wasn't young soldiers who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had the disputes\nFreud regarded as his air ... young was joining us Freud favored apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although a tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his own rights who made himself is number one study\nWhich is what you need to do to listen to to anything on dream some someone who's not a dream of\nDespite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on in dreams or rather narrow theory and he tried to apply to humans dreams\nAnd you had famously a dream in which he's in a house that is on many levels and the basement area fall below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is as a floor vote ... something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to Yom as something to do with you know a mother complex and the desire to see somebody dead ...\nAnd Yom didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into coffin of narrow understanding\nAnd that break up was very interesting was accompanied by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and Matthew in relation to these things and one of the conversations with human Floyd approaching that pops up\nThere's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to avoid stop so how scared and confused and ... and Yom wrote in describing that he felt something ... and his belly like a hot sun us and he was going to happen again and there's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing up hot so what we're seeing in that episode\nIs something that goes on in the phone this phenomena ... which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us so it's a very interesting thing in my story about your young says from the afterlife that Freud has changed his opinion he's a vote on a long way since he died but they don't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious realities the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm what is the imaginable realm\nAround is
