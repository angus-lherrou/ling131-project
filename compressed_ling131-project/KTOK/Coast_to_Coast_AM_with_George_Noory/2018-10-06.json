information of stories including every Friday what we call in coached you missed it it's just call him and he's got some great teachers what do you have for us this week Tim\nHey George how you doing in fact we've got some really\nA cool stories for your while this week I Want to make sure we mentioned there up on the goats goes website in the carousel the one two and three spots and folks that we want to check out that in Khost you missed it a column that gives you really sort of the the real a meat and potatoes best of the week stuff and that's every week out the website but\nUh the first story tonight I think you're really gonna like this is a trio of college students\nAre they ... they went for a hike in Arizona they really didn't even want to go on a hike but they had plans to do so and the day they got to get off for a start but they felt compelled to go on this hike\nAnd now they're climbing a dreamy draw mountain near Phoenix they notice a this oddly clad man at the summit of the mountains and he looked like he has long hair and he looks like eating a rope and they marble to each other to kind of joking around like oh that guy looks like Jesus\n... well ... [laughter] I Know\nThey're climbing the mountain oh they lose sight of the guy they get to the top of the mountain you're gonna love this George they find an envelope among some rocks and the envelope read\nDo you believe in angels oh man they open the envelope inside is a message ostensibly from this individual where he talks about how special the mountainous to him and it's where he goes to connect with God\nAnd how these uh three college students were chosen by God to find the mountain and find the envelope and inside ... really enough\nOr three one hundred dollar bills G. three hikers\nThey must have been a shock\nYeah yeah they they they described it as like America like the lord was speaking to them and it's like what is an angel\n... it merely kind hearted man uh you know I went to the extreme lengths I don't know but it's quite the story it really is\nMartin that's on our cure saw on the coast to coast to um dot com\nAbsolutely that's the number to spot on the carousel up the coast to coast website and the other big story here I Want to share with you I which I just got really got a laptop and lighthearted fun stuff here or to close out the week was the third annual sasquatch calling festival\nWas held last weekend and thirty nine people took part in this where they pretty much unleashed their best a big foot inspired who towels and whoops and we have the winning entry actually we had the audio that if you want to hear\n\nSounds like big puts in distressed him\n[laughter] that was that guy won huh yeah it was I was actually a lady was lethal lower hurts only won a hundred dollar price on a little victory\nThough you're sasquatch calling it's got its escorts doesn't show up and you really call yourself in the winter\nI Love it love it didn't we'll talk to you next week collage or\nRead stories were going to be back in the moment with Mary and when ... as we talk more about who's on the other side [noise]\nGruesome video on demand TV channel completely devoted to him the best movies on UFOs into mysteries conspiracies suppressed science it's called US Navy all access you if we can be all access is now available on Amazon ... apple ...\nDot com and download the u._s. ... absolutely and I go to you with ... now for universal access across the old ... devices that us on TV all access trusted for over Twenty years\nSo little things like turning October independent October I stayed and on friday\nWith a ... he got Mr then get ready to be taken paying because your age your savings on NPR parents like says that's as much extra eighty percent on clearance but at first there you get friday and Saturday 'cause when it's actually shopping cart and lying or here you can happen give back to the nation's cancer research foundation states\nWhat it what happened why did we break apart anything like that the same thing somebody that died violently or was murdered if I Can't get to that funeral before that spirit crosses over I Can't give the any law enforcement agencies any information\nBut if that person that was murdered comes in your dream and it was a relative or a friend asked him what the heck happened and you'd be surprised how ... how much information you can get from them and unfortunately they still don't know the lottery numbers\nNo home or or if they do they're not passing them on\nExactly rent\nFor a lot of people who were brand new to the show marry him want to get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were\nA little girl correct a well were you\nGrammar realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth tone spirits the problem\nIs most babies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative that died and Italian [noise]\n... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person would just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gasket but\nHe was fine and he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOh and carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person alive person 'cause I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did did you always have um\n[noise] no I think that the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ...\nEven though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time and by ... so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like\nA hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that is\n[noise] I ...\nThis past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't go into houses if I thought a ghost can kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when that yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going\nMaryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've\nGot a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it's still free will but you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know and I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man this is look at me and go sure girlie not so much anymore now when I tell them to do something they usually listen but I'm usually older and then all of\nHave you ever okay have you ever come across from around the double [noise] I think that\nSeeing him maybe three times or one that we're so that they had come from the black\nCool yeah and I\nIf I ever run across situation now I really try to protect the families that that that I can and I actually get home I'm a religious person so that has more training in that field than me\nTo try to get rid of the devil or the demon or whatever it might be\nThat way that's exactly right and there are people that game and now just taken care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform extra systems or things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possessions where I had done that\nAnd I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do a possession I Would end up pleading somewhere I Would get scratch or or look like when\nShe washed up there and it's like oh no no no no no no no don't have to do this anymore and that again something that I Would refer to in order to increase\nThat's probably pretty smart we are going to come back

right course they will love would call me up to date 'cause she always got her her script you know like three days before the new one right when she got she was good with you she liked ... yeah\nAnd

the ones that they were filming\nWhat do you mean talking about why not look so we're about spirits like the ones I saw\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he didn't uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do is like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a I'm a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a myth barber stand with standing there [noise]\nAnd I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally like all I could remember was Victoria bar only from the\n... and what she was classic actually\nAll while she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny\nAnd so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh and uh and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James they the mistake of one of the cameraman said who is\nIn James mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it and I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's it going for you is anybody listening to you\nAnd she just looked at me and I said and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said\nHer and I said have you talked to other people like people\nShe said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about it in she went in the light so I Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screamed [laughter]\nDo you remember that movie poultry guys in the the little ... little lady kept showing the light don't go to like why why why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea\nI I thought that they possessed or drinks or some some strange way to get the only change their personality I Know they\nThey turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when you go with ... was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that will take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the ghost was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right\nAnd so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped you know\nWork on that and I looked at him and I sort of squinting my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked at me I says why did you put flies in the attic what that have to do with anything\nAnd he said we had Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies had nothing to do was go I needed to exterminate or not a ghost person I says why did you even do that it it's like people they just they do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of the I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest pains in my side is we ...\nYeah I agree with that I

doesn't mean I Can't or hasn't happened but the everyday people that I run into now don't have that ability\nOr that resource to go to so if I can only do the best I can\nYou are generally do every time I talk to you beat Maria and I've never seen you down or your energy level you've got to be able to ban all these things off you like crazy I bet\nWell I I think I can but I think that he has

language or the ... yeah\nYeah if I you know I was angry at finding\nYou know what I wouldn't use I wouldn't use try and try to stay away from who\nRight yeah but I mean could that cost a curse on

noticed that are in myself when I feel kinda awkward and uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light\nBut then for red warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this

the lake you want to go with a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well no he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe another thirty miles from where we were\nThere and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me I didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck just about\nLike a bar full of empires from something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a ... a ... the swatter bright and sign up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and\nIt was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and that was a bunch of old\nPeople that there again I felt that often enough and the air and\nUh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they've found comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and uh yeah they're to me it doesn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward\nRoads there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried to push and couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house\nAnd see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places\nEarlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people when and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaders\nAre doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those

Nolan up I was like oh my goodness about\nTen minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so

for a lot of people who were brand new to the show marry him in a while to get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were\nA little girl correct old were you\nGrandma realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth on spirit the problem is most babies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was Graham a special\nGranddaughter that could come in and talk of the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gift it but\nHe was he was talking to me and I you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... these\nYeah they did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOn carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared that it'd be ... to me it wasn't the dead person alive person 'cause I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did the did you always have um like I\nKnow I think than the older I got\nThe easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time\nAnd by so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like\nA hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was the last thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter ... can do this\nAnd but she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop that oh you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that is happening\n[noise] I ...\nThis past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't houses if I thought it goes to kill me I Am certainly not stupid\nBut I remember I was in the garage and that acts\nHit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when the yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach courage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here [noise] and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead not alive I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it's still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know and I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man this look at van Gogh sure girlie not so much anymore

maybe three times or ones that were so evil that they had come from the black\nCool yeah and I would if I ever run across that situation now I really try to protect the families\nThe best that I can and I actually get a hold of a religious person somebody that has more training in that field than me\nTo try to get rid of the devil or the demon or whatever it might be exactly\nThat's exactly right and there are people that say their team and I'll just like they can take care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform exercises and things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possessions
