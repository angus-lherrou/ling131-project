E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com [noise]\nAll right Claudia Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nEven then how are you okay thank you I'm a ... a lot of a lot of the topics and twice that\nYou make our our ... ingredients of what\nTaking place in the destruction of Europe\nFortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um [noise] it just what they're seeing\nTaking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they call them you know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria should ban and all these regions that are going through wars\nAnd uh we have the needed that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the you which people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on\nAnd I find very interesting a fight and I don't know if I can share on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement or reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back in New York\nTo lock and monitor skew in Sydney and in others but also of course Aristotle and says real but\nBut the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity one looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you on a one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth\nTheir God given God given God created and then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community and if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not\nAnd this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and extraction in which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will and all of society and to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual\nIs willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed as in view it that way conformity in uniform me is not the priority as much liberty for an individual as possible and in order to society and amoral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in addition to that in economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian a government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and a will that has imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border\nSecurity even those who are fairly liberal on the issue of immigration [noise] but you have a political party leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place that is what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and the people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution\nIt's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent but\nWhat's happened here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are ...\nOf haggling marks and angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light ... the embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process Oreo way of agreeing with you All right Claudio thank you for your call appreciate it\n[noise] and when they tell you this every night right up to election day first of all we are going to have an election day that is an election night program when this result start

naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball game\nI notice how I mean this does not seem to register with the media today this is all about being attacked on the on the left\n\nThe continued attacks on all political figures from shootings to attempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic that is becoming more and more pervasive these are attacks on the republic and the intelligence linked to the resistance is usually get sympathy the truth\nIs Democrats are not unique snowflakes they too will suffer the consequences of the civil war that they want to perpetuate\nAnd conservatives will also suffer\nThese attacks are happening to a lot more people in the Clintons with the Obamas we need to wait to hell up and realize that\n\nFrom the two thousand one anthrax attacks to the Unabomber case is using the mail or other services delivered deadly weapons has long been this this ah it's been a\nFrightening history and reality here in the United states anytime things happen like this it's a wake up call\nTo wake up call\n[noise] so did I I I decided that I think it'd be wise to turn some time over to a a good friend and informative the program\nWe we ah we've had him a on before John ... he's a veteran law enforcement officer Rome or twenty five years John worked for the U.S Secret Service San Diego police department\nUs mint police US Customs service in his capacity within the secret service in Nineteen Seventy four the Nineteen Seventy seven he served for over three years John was directly involved in protection of the president first family but White House the vice president and his family masters embassies in has a stake\nThrough his

doing great I just ah [noise]\nYou know I run into a a a a ... I guess you\nCould call it a quandary as kind of a confusion here because you know when you jump on a story this soon especially something like this that appears to be\nA dare I say in an inside job but it inside job from the standpoint of who we are the players within the intelligence community is responsible for this\nYou know people tend to want to play politics again with this and it's not it's it's an attack on the Republican we've had\nRepublican a leadership being attacked with rice and we've had a congressman attempted assassination attempts we've got all these things going on and people are saying well since nobody died it's really not a civil war but no this is this this civil war would you agree\nThat those type of response was you're getting her from the left\nFor educators they're just trying to throw a monkey wrench into your nation you are for runner and if you are the best of the information or talk to\nAnd I'm telling you you're hitting so on line with this stuff\nThat's all they're left to do is to try and you know the or the fall it's all other responses this stuff has been going on for years I mean I I keep thinking 'cause I was quoted his mother national magazines about uh some news of this\nSchool year ring a bell yeah a friend of mine area where this goes back\nAnd there's another reporter Gary Webb dead I mean how many hours you kill I say ... you know except richest Gary Webb that's another reporter John Castle are I mean a copy of that happening are all arrow yeah Danny capital arrow he he got killed\nI mean you did it on the legs this takes me back to the nineties\nWhen I was working closely with Mike roofer LAPD who helped expose jobs go each of the CIA [noise] of the axis of the ... about the cocaine being infiltrated this black communities where the ... freeway Ross Lester effort [noise] and I knew Gary with\nI got a picture of me and Maxine Waters at my age age to cuss scripture dot com [laughter] she didn't do anything to help us out really really ... I'm Sorry there's a big D right after each of those names right\nRight right well we're just seeing or just seeing how you know ... we had to be rice attacks just to just a little while ago and there wasn't that much commotion with the rice in the tax and even at a suspect within you know what a day or whole\nYeah yeah the um the uh miss you\nIn my words you're the special beans and rice and beans is um [noise] the the and it wasn't actually the process of being you know\nThe castor bean that's right so when they're shoving a tons of castor bean is in the mail is like wow really I mean\nLet's say ... but this goes back years so if you pick the part of the stuff like you do and I do and I know rod those you sit through intelligence and information you guys are on top of this stuff and that that's good because that means that\nUh I don't have to explain too much but it's like with all my background and training I mean I was within two or three hundred yards of explosions Russian embassy or sixteenth street\nWhich is two to three blocks away from the White House of Venezuelan embassy ring a bell yeah yeah and also outside the White House a couple of times Seventy five Seventy six rotor and that type of friend that was four and then of course\nSo are we safe to say is it safe to say that this has all the earmarks of a criminal element within the intelligence operations that allowed this to go down to that was a somehow\nPut together by um a number of ... I guess you'd call them rogue agents or I mean I hate to use the word deep stake because that's kind of you know give me a mate\nLeft wing left wing Democrat socialist or oh is this what you're saying is that we believe yeah that's what those guys are yeah\nOkay so you're ... so do you believe that that's what this was it was it was basically staged by what eight extreme left group\nYeah they're stressed out they don't have anywhere to throw their little arguments like Maxine you know block to block that a lot of do this create a crowd or you know why it right now so I'm Sorry but that's a that's a felony and that's inciting riots\nWell do you think though that you know I Know Donald Trump has been also raising the rhetoric and I find it weird that with all the rhetoric has been raised elsewhere immediately be seized upon Donald Trump you know Donald Trump is contributing Hillary Clinton actually contributed to this as well as you said well if you want civility you got to put Democrats in the Senate\nAnd then Donald Trump said well if Republicans don't make the Senate there'll be violence so you have the president saying there'll be violence you have a you know who the one who wanted to be president saying that there would be violence or violence will continue until they get what we want\nNow we have bombs being sent to people I mean it's like why don't we give the equal opportunity to everybody that's inciting the violence and and actually encouraging it\nRight and they've had assassinations already already brought obsessed rich I'm very familiar I was working on stuff\nOn there that I'm not going to talk about um\nThere were some other cases where people were assassinated\nAnd um it's all tied in with the shooting at the ballpark sees type of thing so all these things are excited but when they talk about violence and things like that\nThere is a philosophy from the left that it's okay to lose its a communist philosophy it's okay to lose half of your country or half of your population as long as you with\nJohn Carmen with us on ground zero for the you know the former Secret Service us Secret Service for doing customs us to employees or has

put it in a special take and they'll we'll it off with the U.S army or something and exploded somewhere\nSee what I find interesting is that you were talking about the rudimentary nature of these bombs being sent out\nAn diet it kinda makes me wonder about that ah when what was it just a few weeks ago Venezuela or their leadership or someone tried to assassinate their leader and he tried to do it with the drone or just to find drawing they were going to use it to get killed but we do yes\nAnd I think yeah there are plenty of other ways but then see that's why these pipe bombs I think are effective because they're there to scare\nThey weren't there to kill their their to scare and they're they're in my opinion a to a you know pork or at least change the views of elections in political

and attack was a domestic terrorist attack but that nobody even reported that they just\nKind of gone down to the people are telling me it was quite usually when reporting it yeah I was I was the only way to report it finally decided they'd reporting was all over the news the mainstream like two days later after they found a suspect but it wasn't it wasn't as much hysteria as we have now because so many of the Democratic leaders were mailed these packages\nOr the Obamas the Clintons dead you know Eric Holder is Maxine Waters says that she got one a so a number of people who have gotten these and uh none of the bombs went off\nOr they said the one at CNN had some sort of a logo on it it looked like something from ISIS or which basically was it was kind of a parody that says get her done I'm\nBasically a ... this is all something that uh it it sounds it it just got the earmarks of intelligence written all over it and I and I'm going to make a prediction that if they find a suspect there's certainly going to say that he had some connection to the FBI or the FBI knew the guy was going to plan on doing this I mean that's what always happens is that right John John Carmen against the night\nYeah and ... and you were just reminded me of a bunch of other things so because you know I it it just showed nearly job with the White House and they said that his six yeah\nI think he was

diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post as to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary standards\nNot the standards of Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and actually executed by a those in the deep state against President Kennedy\n\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one\nThe country would be in France in national polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\n\nNumber three there will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimate they are and the illegitimate evasion\nOf violence to solve any and all disputes now I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out\nAnd of course we have been analyzing and speculating about the state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst said this is a an invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow governors always been the dark command that leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nThey while we're looking under rocks for false flag proof all we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago\nThere was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all it's just we're attacking officials\nBut this isn't registering and the media today the only thing\nThat's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to attempted bombings or part of a civil war tactic and it's becoming more and more pervasive\nThese are attacks on the Republicans and and the intelligence that are linked to these resistance they're using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats were said to be the truth is Democrats are not unique Republicans are not unique in the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nBe attacks are happening to a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's there are journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent the journalists we've had rice and being sent a journalist\nSo time to wake up\nSome Americans have hit the Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders just like in John carpenter's a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has been glazed over by an overly political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic Lee infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\n\nThe film still remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible for the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a renaissance is is forty years sequel is selling out to theaters across the country the original Halloween introduced to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul\nWhen he also infuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds of every moment in the film they live carpeted portrays the government working against its own citizens\nThat appears to be some silent alien infestations echoes the films invasion of the body Snatchers if you remember that film\nHowever in the body Snatchers movie there were some people that we're realizing that their loved ones were losing their humanity\nIn a film they live\nCarpenter shows that the majority of the populace are out of touch with reality and they have allowed technology to run 'em up\nThey have allowed believed to choose their values they are unaware that a war has been waged against them and their way of life do you recall\nCarpenter also did the film escape from New York where the future of America is fascism\nSo the bottom line is\nThat the message has been quite clear and no one seems to be listening we're being fed a series of\nCarefully contrived fictions but there are no resemblance to reality [noise] and the agent provocateurs create these attacks in order for us to feel as though we are threatened by forces beyond our control [noise]\nAnd with these tactics they're able to destabilize the country making us distrustful of each other divided by our prejudices and in others throats these types of events generate a lot of fear based retaliation\nAir symptoms if part of or within the realms\nAnd the confines of civil war in the United states of America\nUsing the constitution eliminates these problems using the rule of law limits these problems [noise] any of the corruption impunity that would eliminate these problems but until then we will be others throats will accept the pictures that are fed to us and we will not admitting or we will see the civil war on our doorstep in Chile\nThe idea that violence is the only way to somehow or change the discourse is part of civil war all of these factions are part of civil war and the only reason why people don't think we're in civil war\nIs because it didn't happen the way they were told it was going to happen we're not having an armed conflict right now\nBetween America and they'd be Americans just shooting Americans well I mean American shoot Americans every day or Chicago or it seems to be a highly climate with guns going up and things happening like that but when we have bombs in the leadership where we have people who have to a planet around mob these are ... and\nParts talking part designed post symptoms perhaps of what would be a civil war did they say the diagnosis is not come from you it comes from history and I said sometimes you don't know what

focus on is what people will get all excited about what's excluded they don't get excited about what they don't see they won't add up to say hey we're in the middle of something really bad here\nAnd it it it's like but the civil war that happened in South American the Nineteen seventies and eighties it's like what happened prior to Ukraine and then when he was destabilized these things are happening in America and no one sees it for what it is\nRoger why is that people are not paying attention why don't they why don't they just stop\n... they they they're they're completely incensed and

this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait and get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities in intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one and others throats\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem in whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting

this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same\nTeam and the media not not coast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nNote on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed

they'll go to the public if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their some keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWhether somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again\nI Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight\nShut out wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time

let's see who you are hello there\nAnd how you doing oh boy this is going to be tough I'm fine how are you\nKnow not been for ... days up oh I don't know I got older things get tough for\nIts Stanton reading anymore it's Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed I guess [laughter]\nI I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell or it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to Olympic to mail hunger\nAnd yes you are an ID we need we need you on this program my friend die heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in on teen years I have no engagements and the ... of January November and December can't believe it two months of outgoing anywhere\nAh against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your standard I going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw little clipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nOr an uncle in university and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's ... you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder\nOut I went to interview stance in Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known them ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stamp was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big beer and I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo and stand tell me tell me what's going on in the field of you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell on the latest word began looks like there's about one point six planets per star not bring galaxy star and our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion star\nAll that means one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the place\nAnd you know and that changes our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only of doom civilization ... around and we're at the top of the heap well roll over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course I'm not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from there is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth now we're ... we're fusion for example you can get\n... or we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and part of the world was created and four thousand ... see that's right can't be too late beings around you know well he was off a little bit four billion be seen as\nThey are just a little the little\nUh our ... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know her family [noise]\nUm we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result them\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization of people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying but the mirror throws a climate that they put in incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a ... boy guys and brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's you're standing you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide\nBut in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so I've got to buy new number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand flights you know if there are life out there and we see it mhm you know they would make contact them by the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd weight that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOil or or still slapped [laughter]\nAnd and so most of us have learned that\nIt's a more complex place for them we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know we're not the most advanced\nAs much shouldn't be surprising again because we've known now we measured the age of ... and the stars and things like that and uh hey\nNot number oh oh no no and so what we and you can tell from another thing\nWell a jury budget on a blind eye it's about a trillion dollars this year so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow that at all the\nPeople don't get the goodies of our problem there and work uh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a but it appears to be close to what it is [laughter]\nI'm not going to try to explain why or how but we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy you will to men in the universe [laughter] you know I've gone to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place how ... ... almost kind of stuff in\nThe universe crowded [laughter] you know it takes a while to get here and there you don't get on your bicycle and go to the next stories [laughter]\nCom we put the information up after I guess who they are or if I don't guess like she'll put it up right after that but we'll be back\nWith your
