and I was talking with a friend of mine and she was telling me about\nHow some people when they're touched by mental illness some of them believe that\nThey they'd been touched by the spirits in other words they have\nJust open contact at all times\nAnd I was just curious if you know you said you use the board and you said you had contacts with friends who have passed do you believe that outside of the use of the board that perhaps you get messages are you sometimes\nGet word from either friends who have passed or maybe even some of the victims of Bob\n[noise] I think you know the the main thing they say when you're\nIn schizophrenia is that if you have it as a child that's the worst kind and I didn't have it as a child and so I didn't get it wasn't until later that [noise]\n... the doctor

celebrity people\nCan talk to me personally you know and I I'm just I'm just an average person\nAs some celebrities talking and they wanted the or one lady ... son committed suicide or the board 'cause the board was just\nSaying image but I put it on was like oh you know what I made a color copy and so a lot of people in Los Angeles you stay in one very famous actress sunny killed

[noise] I think\nUm was naive and he put he put this together to talk to you that comes in then you know allies\nCome they come back on to him and he kept on driving around at one point in my

body was never found\nNo send my and my grandfather [noise] uh no I saw the no it was because he never were right in free and I'm never rode anything down and you were I use that so [noise]\nYou know wondering what was his last words in the letter\nK can name all because of the stress being haunted says he made a mistake but making the board\nAnd people on earth and then he wanted to New Jersey

back and basically thank them for the which board\nAnd he said it was you know really made it was it's made out of great ingenuity but he said that you will hardly think shall meet the caskets power is close to the future\nSo we know the industry or do the talking board enter into the community of the fiercest movement and also it in the United states only but it was it Ninety or we used to board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One patent and trademark it was in production at that point so there's really some interesting stories about that and Eighteen to Canada\nSo right from the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and so forth such as Bob sport which again falls into that category hockey boards\nA lot of or it's after the war makes it a prominent black into the market I mean everybody was fine I mean you know the heyday I mean this has been a spiritual visit with going big time and I was going on with their\nThe case at the time that people started making copycat boards and started getting different types of their own type a board and of course we get the trademark patted her name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a\nParticularly as unique as the story of of Bob being a a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically feel that it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you are in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned you know if people didn't act around and start customizing selling them\nBut the degree of this type of story no I never\nHeard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money ... there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case I'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before\nOr I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted\nA legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if he did because he checked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know that's that's the that's the thing is he avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution\nI mean and and since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so did they take it seriously\n[noise] well it's just kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on would just put the color a Xerox is on on board\nAnd then I met this guy used to work for\nCurrent affair which is an old TV show or on a which is on like channel five or something right in the east and um he was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated them show he did like producing I think mhm current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level\nLike the same image to same exact you know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYeah and the and the background to write the background history\nYes and they were told and everything you know and they put it down so they made it more like a sophisticated I guess\nBut I'm the same story and it's a very and I tell people you know\nNot to and I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old because this is real this is really happen this really works and it's very scary and if if you have the wrong intentions\nAnd you know everybody is we call go to the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back\nSo I always say that it's not a joke\n... no I'm In I Want to ask her and you know I have some I have criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time let's be honest ... used to board a gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they use it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use I mean you know boards can rudimentary like that even even\nWhen you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights so that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need boards do we care and I mean even the boards there or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves the Borgias becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into naval due to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board with that my own six cents ... started developing really it's not really being fine tune\nAnd taken aboard the way I can still do this work and be a lot of people ... and the old days these typewriters [laughter] word processors now they use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board the people at the tactile experience and the movement movement itself that kind of opens up the receptor so you could start bringing in the information and so again I might be Bill Clinton aboard there's no negative energy with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen\nUnless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that my desire or that's how I view the world so people just don't even know people are scared us even talking about this on the radio while I have\nAre do they they they bring in the they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and it's a deal motor responses are that are based basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions in the mind that come from the unconscious\nIf it's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters and so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the board as you say is like a permission slip but it's like a way to\nTo view I mean people would use pencil that I I used to know a media embed would or would he would do his thing he would just scribble he\nWould take hensel and he would just scribble on a new bad and he just scribbling scribbling as he scribbling for some reason they just doing the scribble he's looking at going all I see a scribbling but what I see what he saw it was something else [noise] and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of\nI don't know doing something with his hands on his mind was bringing in the information primaries getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are you using something else but it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body the city of motor response that certainly is a interesting when you see it in an action tonight on grounds that we're talking

hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred not to demystify the board and still mysterious thing but it's just to let you know the board itself is in ... it's not something to be afraid

happening in science and that's why Michael dealing with Glenn joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to

how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils that I don't know your ... believe me\nThere there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it\nOminous news from the frontiers of science as his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that and that's why I asked ... uh uh uh later on a\n... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I\nI I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and\nShe's a she's a frequent guest year and they're very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is just very I Love it\nYou know she's great and you'd really like her and this is just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America hunting hunting Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto it very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the world Wide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to opt load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report be able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of on my uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and somebody's office\nI think they didn't dominate the planet for a long time\nUntil Seventeen Seventy six

reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nTrying to get their hands on some DNA some you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're drawing a traits in other words we are flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature member the commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice ... nice to mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for that exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to ... and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but [noise] he recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything\nThey they control everything if we give him that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship because we want to stay on it's good because the technology we're creating\nWell run amok and you know you start taking it a little crazy this guy but you know it's not because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can be a chance you know Texas hold them poker and they are they getting go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game or a ... game around oh yeah\nYeah I probably won't smoke\nYeah you're right in artificial snow cats you know the the goat champion and so it's on the wall I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers are not just going to become fans they're no longer just adding machine there no there are just giving copy\n'em but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we are we watched boast about being very good at it yet but they're not saying they're still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced to be even greater than ours that singularity that they are all singularity then one day we'll have the equivalent to you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nI think they think these are that too is that the equation is what you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a high rise in line for human intelligence right to go with the IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machine and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know like using it a drop ten point\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get most she knew who knows it might be like we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nAll adults are like the cushy moxie ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it you lose\nA yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer crazy with that you know I Know I fully believe that completely and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like marriages like democracy like random shit\nI think our light as we know it is much more fragile than people would like to think cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future and we'll get back to that thought with Michael Steele and the loss of shooting the number is coming up and about thirty minutes for you to join the conversation\nAnd then it's open line for the rest of the night coast to coast am\nIn for George Lori this is

frontier\nOf all of this home technology with Michael Guillen in a moment but I I wanted to wrap up that conversation about uh about trends humans as you talk about them in the book is people who are becoming part of something else or use physical\nI'm an ... from technology to be able to compensate for\n'em either for injury or for a deformity um and there's a couple of those that are very entertaining like the guy with the built in my breeder and some of the other stuff that's [laughter]\nThat's in the book but the part I thought it was really interesting and I just I wanted to mention that because I I I think they're this idea of the eggs those skeleton\nI'm ... I Know several people who have a ... who has\nA trouble walking or the lost their ability to walk and they've been spinal injuries and\nAnd that this to them is a dream I mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that or you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement are called the trans human movement where as you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there's wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground\nAnd he'd lost both arms zap them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms that\nHe can move with his thought so they're they're wired to his\nMind and I and I was amazing fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you name it even end um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never to believe the new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to [noise] and uh you know we're talking about an ... a human soldiers abilities but I think are\nEqually realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words to give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know\nYeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we are just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would\nPropose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ...\nYou know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for him and there were some Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going or at his weaknesses\nBut but positive for setting because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay or had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those\nHalloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now that this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with it I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end in how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they\nThey the the veins and the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and\nThere's at least one guy and Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic a you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nSo for two hundred and forty two years they've been trying to get it back\nAnd we America has really that's the fight that we see going on right now\nDoesn't still feel out of kilter off to you know something more\nThere's a grand force is out there that need not just one scene nice to capture the soul of the world but I don't think they're going to win I don't think\nThey're going to win here's Stacey co on with the daily consumer on XM satellite radio that remember a few\nMonths ago when bank

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah\nThey won't have soles God didn't make them they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll\nBe like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the your schedule right are you going to be on the on the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think the way\nYou were talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation it talked about in mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance fine\nIt says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in the stones to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jive\nWith what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nAh and and so I I'd I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence bean whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky all is a a kind of a role of human like robot but gets so complex\nAnd so the non ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\n[laughter] you know it's like the sky net running it's like running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I mean that's the forefront\nOr for the crush the people it\nStops on on you know getting getting itself coffee yeah I get that I think\nIt's a technology now right have you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know the pizza machinery it's going great\nStops and it goes on you know\nI Try to tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a kid more elite dishwasher six\nSo I ... that's exactly where I'm living by the way to somebody with a I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible and the the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations you're always resolved with them\nSo that it might let me go to or let me go to a gay then who is in Arizona on coast to coast David\nHey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by June ... artificial intelligence\nUm\nYou're breaking up you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good question\nYeah you just lose them\nAnd we just lost\nA ball game then in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI I'm enjoying your show but um I've been kicking machine going on forty five years yesterday\nAnd I was very scary future generation like you know from your guest or when you feel safe to well be overcome true Chris or or um or just like okay my um yeah so you're\nHanging there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\n... what kind of get what kind of machine every\n... years on dialysis he's not kidding macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think the technology really it's very\nUm [noise] they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's fight with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman\nOr who had the operation and you know even though are still not crystal clear she can she can make a shape and they give an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are already working on a second\nGeneration or that will help actually restore sight people who were born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also and they can't make fun I don't think we need to create a marriage\nA there's a lot of great research and I recorded on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells or create or artificial Oregon so\nThat are more for the person [noise] [noise] yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother you know that that is really where the technology is very hopeful\nAnd that's where we'll have to end with Michael deal in the book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and a free your spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open line next on the coast to coast am necessity

I Hope you went to coast to coast am dot com and watched this video of the Oregon pot shops and the moving jar it'd be didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nIn downtown Oregon City here are very much at least that's the theory behind\nParanormal activity witnessed that fine zero trees a candidate to Spencer eat less than having now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it\nAs it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing there like somebody was like right here\nSuddenly the jar falls off the level surface that does happen then Andy remembered the surveillance handling we saw this I\nNot long after that this happened watch the Penn ... it's completely still and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... state than many as GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with you as a form\nOf ... so yeah so this could have been the pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it as you want to jump in on open lines of ... let me go to Mike in Charlotte North Carolina on coast to coast to get started Mike\nAnything good morning hours yacht [laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run the road with the blood animal children\n[laughter] yes well anyway and right now right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's now going into the are going to be in the Eighteenth inning for the world series you know the question of being whether this show ends before that game and where do you want to take off\nA about George Bush just oh dear\n\nWell everything was fine and the trailer talked about a clothing that is not the circuit bitter or ... forever ... blah blah and one problem download memory download horses could download mannerism can download actions\nMatch by robots now but it won't be alert gang because you\nCan't show [laughter] so I guess some of the feelings and the personality of the callers I I'm with you in your it I mean we're the incident in\nThe Bible says that they are aware of nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not gosh that's all I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say that and it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul\nIf other people out there have you know\nUh other men if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human than they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology young sold 'em but I think there's much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about test to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond\nThat uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I and world power guys first of all for not less in for five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nUm after last night I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... he ... her saying I'm a revival manner or would it have anything he could've kept toward it survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and that sort of firemen now and furthermore it our current situation right now we have\nThere are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for that families\nWith multiple wives with multiple shelter with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not fees are usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies what's known somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a sketch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt for the oil like to um fallen scare myself\nNot to a consuming somebody's supplies but just to ... myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just see somebody could even\nHis they themselves and interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know what's going to survive it could be a child\nIt could be a twelve year old kid who haven't had any training on how to year the supplies that are stored up and move codes are or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are a latter day saints and so I just really be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do\nBut to her point I was watching on Netflix a there's a series called uh like the men with three wives who were three wives club

my question\nAnd that we're missing missing missing something here\nWell interesting claim that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean\nI think you'll always see migrations in the long history just to bring up the Bible again\nOr this is that we're all immigrants right the Bible says that we we all move 'em and you know the all the stories you a lot of the stories revolve around people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging people to allow them to live in in space as food\nSo I kind of see that is not something new but\nIs there is there if it that's the smoke screen than what's behind it I guess we're supposed to wonder about or are you suggesting that something is going to come from the north um while we're so busy looking south and east is that was that part of your implication\nThat question I mean all they want or something else happened that we're missing and concentrated and I uh I I\nDon't think I Can't answer but I'd love

argue in really listen to you\nFor so long I I started out listening to art bell and I've tried to call in a couple of hundred times and this first time I've gotten through this is such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible\nA and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline a\nIf any discipline that you study whether it be science\nOr whether it be ah the Bible for instance\nUh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a drink\nAnd the and the Bible is something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the aesthetic religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible and polluting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the nutrients and the new ... the the ...\nYeah I mean the the story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible a\nMini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value of the book uh Daniel is so accurate and ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as he as he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this\nHas done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right now it's terrible whole book or you know and they'll\nA settled in and you know it's called proof texting and it's yeah it's there's a\nThere's an old saying I've I've said it before I go to ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was that some people\nSome people rely on a on scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamp post not so much for the ... nation but for support and I think it's the elimination\nPart that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about um about the true crime checks I'm interested in how true crime stories are told and I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what the murder stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the Bible in the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is the Jesus who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out to you I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity\nHas a you know our Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies ... do you think that that has hurt us and gotten us away from a from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always been been to a big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God and I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter]\nI'll take the bullet in protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go way far on to their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I uh that's where I draw the line and join the conversation the rigging you've got a great town I'll let you get back to work too but um last time I was in a Bowling Green actually they were doing work I was on my way to

what'd you make a difference being murder and show that's fascinating that could be off that lives with me for a week in a in it\nIsn't it just ... and the fact that it's Islam where they say murder the Jesus was murdered\nYeah that's amazing that it really is I don't know I'm ... go ahead\nWell I yeah I wanted to take us back to the Bible um I was telling the screener I'm a I'm for\nLack of a

I'm more in line with like Quakers and I've had with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age when they get the current age began if there's disagreement about\nThat oh yeah ours is that because\nThey're turning I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're ... I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in for\nAnd this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and Neal Marxism and you know all we can ever do is the arise 'cause we can't there's no there's no met a data so that we can tap into that explains\nOh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that otherwise would be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I ... I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exist up there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years I'm ... because there's a lot of different books that address I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\n[noise] I don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with it covered right ... years\nI'm ... I didn't want to a wrap it up quickly a lot of could go back to you about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with that kind of what you're saying I respectfully disagree\nI think it's an earlier caller you think about a lot of like\nA ... you're you're Christian creatively how are we we all worship something you know what the money or ... or whether it's gone so [noise] um that we really Krishna ... your ... your trip to worship [noise]\nI I I appreciate that but I also think there's a downside to that as a sure ... you know we have this freedom but we don't always use it responsibly oh yeah every ... or so individually or can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more have some kind of shared values\nYeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political year I I think what holds us together as a country is ... I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut what people talk about the border that makes us a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona in ... or soon to be a a cans and it's like ... crossed the border that exist on a piece of paper [noise]\nIt I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more it back to a previous caller who said we got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to your philosophy should be where every education's dark I agree with that but it's the shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers based in the entire country I think that's what we need to always focus\nOn [noise] that's the that's the most important things to other things are also important to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot [noise]\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the blather but gosh darn it that was great\nThank you so much for jumping in an open line ed or look forward to borrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case [noise]\nLet him make that decision I Want to like a George ...

night and tonight or coming up uh again tomorrow night the uh the book that I think you will love hearing the story of demand from the train\nOr as scary as a story is um it's still not as scary in some respects to some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael dealing with Glenn joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place in America\nAnd uh and when cameras captured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment and coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the fold right in the carousel\nOn the top of the website it goes to go see 'em dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it because I Love to get back to this coming up later on in the show wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City here are very to leave that theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that science hero

how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I\nI don't know your ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are\nAmongst I think in the lead group of science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very I Love it\nYou know she's great and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this is enough to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... but I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear\nFor somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and uh with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto it very realistic robot so that Larry King can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of a you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\nI think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nOne station I'm listening to right now news radio one thousand ...

reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is a is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nThe idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like the weather that was due uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we are flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice and I was not nice to mother\nNature that one yeah it's not a nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're\nFighting against you know a billion according\nTo science you know billions of years of evolution right where we need to do that and we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant you know and but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do buy\nSlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out well\nYou know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but he recently applied to the artist and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface of sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go\nYeah yeah ...\nRight in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall E N I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we once spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty far\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than art at the day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him when they will have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand a hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think the interesting these are that you is it ... the equation is with you you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I used to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on her own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy uh yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer\nThe yes raising with that the right now I fully

conference place since my ... he became head coach cowboys are one and three they've had a a really good history here lately against the Texas Longhorns they\nAre they've blown out taxes are they one games it probably shouldn't have one like last year's for instance Texas just self destruct at all over the place\nSo uh this what is going to be interesting and it will be interesting also because will there be any kind of changes will the cowboys do anything at all different from what they've done my Gandhi was asked about that\nNot so much are you going to start somebody else a quarterback because he has said he's not going to do that are you going to maybe change some things around with the up and said why did you want to get some extra looks during the week the guys that maybe I haven't played a lot to see if they're ready and here's what the judge to say about that\nI think that people that that say that are are being somewhat unrealistic if there are other guys we thought we needed to look at we would have already done that\nAnd it's not this far in the season we've been added August September half of October so ten weeks into it um we pretty much know who we have out there and the guys that were working I'm trying to get them ready for the next game [noise]\nSo no big personnel changes I think though that we may see some some differences perhaps in some of the blocking schemes\nHurt some talk coming out of Stillwater that they're gonna try to simplify some things a little bit\nUh but as far as personnel they they're going to go with a they're going to go with what rung up here and so what would my ... like to see in this game what do you want to see from his guys\nOh well I I Would like to limit 'em\nMissed assignment we've had a number of missed assignments that I've talked about in air over the last couple of months that we would need to reduce and there's different ways to handle that you you can get into packages somewhat um [noise]\nSome of it's related to youth and inexperience and would like to to reduce those numbers are and that would give us the best chance to have success so we just got to push forward and polish that give some of those guys more reps offensively\n[noise] um we've gone into games where we have a protected very well and then games we haven't run block very well we really haven't put it together in a while so I'd like to see that and then defensively [noise]\nUm we go through phases where we don't defend the deep all very well and then we haven't defended the run very well and we really haven't put that together so I'd like to see us do that uh that would be a good start\nUh yeah it would be a good start so with that being said is Mike a little bit disappointed by what he's seen from the defense\nOh I don't I wouldn't say disappointed I I'm\nJust what I said earlier I Would like to to minimize the big plays um you know last year we ended up a lot of big place and and that that was one of the concerns I have [noise] we we did a better job at Kansas State this'll be a much different challenge with a\nStrength that they have out on the perimeter I'm In and I just want to see 'em some of the young guys that are back there I Want to see them mature quicken compete which ah sometimes just takes a little time [noise]\nSo not really disappointed but I guess I'm\nMore excited to see a change and to to see us play a little bit more of a a game like we did really against boise's last time that we were really were good against Iran and we gave up a couple throws the for the most part we challenge to quarterback pretty good and also challenged the ... the routes\nThat's really what I Would like to see on defense\nIt looks like from what we understand coming out of Austin that Sam al anger will starting quarterback the bar and more and she was able to practice\nA you know he got banged up a little bit in the game against you but uh it looks like he will be able to go coming up here on a Saturday and what about Texas here's what Mike and he had to say about the horns\nThere are really talented football team they're really good players and the public in the media and everybody buys into recruiting services will recording services tell you they're really good and I think that's what you look for when you see him play a lot of really really good players on the field and things like that they're playing with more confidence that this time um\nYou know they've got two quarterbacks that they've had success with a got a couple of white out sooner you know I haven't really good years and and then defensively their their sound they can run to the football you're you're not going to get a lot of freebies on them um they've minimize the big plays due to their speed and athleticism\nNow just taking a look at uh the rankings in the ah in college football Texas ranks sixty fifth in total up at a four hundred and ten yards game or she was twelve at four hundred Ninety three rushing off in Texas is eighty ...\nThe horns of forty seven though as you as twenty second total deep ants little ah more edge to Texas Red zone off ants longhorns are a hundred seven teams in the nation cowboys are thirty yes\nRed zone defense both pretty good oh issues twenty first in the country Texas is twenty seven\nNow the one thing what Scott fans that kind of fire it up and
