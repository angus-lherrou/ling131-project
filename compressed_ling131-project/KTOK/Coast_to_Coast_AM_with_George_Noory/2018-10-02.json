talking about right that um it's a it's everywhere\nAnd I remember we said that was in his intelligent evil dust ah because of his quote unquote top secret thing we revealed a back lash ... even a few weeks ago I Believe about three or four weeks ago\nWe did we talked about this need classified statement\nThat ah you know somehow they were releasing nanoparticles nano bought a and of course Muskie even talked about the ... project with which is another nano technology type of project and\nNano domestic Quayle was with something that we were talking about in the theory in the in the delivering so be of the notion in the energy classified statements\nAnd we said look very nerd but hey everybody has them everybody has picked up on them and of course a lot of that said well and everybody knows that this nano particulate is actually connected\nTo more gallons and I'm a Brad Olson called the program it was a writer and he said he has had more gallons or has more gallons he said that everyone can be tested for it and we all have their their propensity to develop is because of the nano particles that are in our body\n\nAnd man I'll tell you people were like going this is nonsense is a pseudo science this is crazy and now ...\nHe said that she made this he made the statement before\nHe's he's last this was this was his last broadcast that he said before and we don't know what's going on will join his sons right now\nJust today\nWell I don't have time to get right into it but uh it was funny because uh\nToday is I was looking over\nSome of the the reports\nAnd in the in the

say well look this is this is how it is now\nBefore we were talking about if you were like God that and now it's like this is the real deal people smart cities uh they're they're saying well we have trillions without one trillion sensors that we have to put in place by the you're twenty twenty\nThe FCC saying you got six Ninety Days to start figuring out how we're going to install smart city

twenty that's a lot\nBecause that's a lot of sensors putting by but within two years or even less than two years\nSo how do they how how do they fix that problem evil intelligent dust that's the way they do it it's easier\nTo drop trillions of nano particles the size of a grain of sand or grain of salt and they can do it in a less amount of time I'm\nSure there'll be putting sensors in the bigger

New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in oh five years\nOr Iran spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional soda\nThat is a sort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son science ... in general the next year or so up by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is in ... and it's a ... I wanted to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third of any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is\nFocus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be as well and one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there there there may is because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it with people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports a need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like liquor these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere\nAnd I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you chat to chart the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one and you could in\nGeneral I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at say midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nYeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always rising and the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the charge because it's midnight and so there you have to feed and all the other plants like friends\nIt's midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional part of the war will go into its own sign actually laid on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but something with Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\n... why does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this is what the old idea exactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born in a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the ... still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that three they taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used for the America's Choice because it was a first\nBreath were were say guess what England were independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that choice but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon the various plant if it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that say about the potential\nOf my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website or new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month they in near earth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nGoes the time make it more accurate you are you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know one on board and ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month staying here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it near noon his son said is it\nA midnight we're all the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most the ... are going to be in the ... they're going to be in the same science but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts or mood even reincarnation and looking back at who we may have been with the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has to do with personality the sun is more of a character and kind of the life force\nAnd a connection a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing find which was sunrise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah isn't this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay 'cause I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't there I was Thirteen what had happened twenty two when I got into the other is on the nuclear and Atomic Energy area\nLet's talk more about that and take phone calls in just a moment right here on the coast to coast day

[laughter]\n[noise]\nAnd Jordan already back could you hear more Lerner the astrologer with us mark how long would it take someone just study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I\nOkay it took me one year it was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner George grungy of a a spent ski ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane where you are who was one of the great astrologers of twentieth century and he had studied not just astrology but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of thought\nSo I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there of the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was in\nWhen I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and often underrated was in the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits of regressions with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince ... since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going to medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was\nBorn I go home and just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned to before astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people have studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes LA or and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault\nThey were all went to that phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand why why was the greatest scientists before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nNow how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWell what they didn't realize is who was the science was taught in the universe is if Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt\nRome great you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's burned the December\nTwenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay worn out one forty two in the afternoon now in\nJersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know um ah what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty\nQuick in and you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean uh if they can say it to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nWelcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I you know the great you you're on with mark Lerner of given mark you burn they you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say ah of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of\nThe hour people don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon coming from other lives in like instinctively this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in other allies particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn that's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and he should be make sure he strengthens his immune system and stays healthy that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things\nUm but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things a\nLot you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you a ... inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there was a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere was a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic Lee people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else so that's all part of things indefinitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and\nOur incarnations like in the chart we're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan a higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets in the configuration that we have\n... reincarnation astrological you speaking yeah we're they born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that\nWell were they born during the same time period\nThere's a whole question about that kind of thing\nYou know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life [noise]\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMike ... will come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from fellow man and a woman being able to come into the world of north ... time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely in other words the soul and spirit comes in and chooses\nParents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of thing and then you're actually choosing went to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people to talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go out to Cleveland

though that has deep and significant so that\nYou don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line it called the trying which is flowing to your son to be an organizer this is what you you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes we've been nurse or a doctor or or a student or\nKnow a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSo it kind of deep seated study penetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good

Eighteen fifty California enter the union as the son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tour of sun find tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where your earth fine in California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you of mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to do something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationary in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyme into NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power of Venus which is your son sign ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there is a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nYeah

strong at his inauguration it has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids that little plants like higher on ... the targets overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously not overwhelmed the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they were very significant\n... mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve and New Year's day to get predictions for two thousand
