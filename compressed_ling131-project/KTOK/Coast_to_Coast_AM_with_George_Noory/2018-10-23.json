board of Texas Senator Ted Cruz\nDark reddish brown to crimson go juveniles are typically appreciated pink according to a study published in Nineteen Ninety the journal Smithsonian contributions\nTo marine sciences so they're really fascinated by the sea cucumber gave me the creeps ... really weird is that uh it got me thinking about second genesis and what second genesis is is well scientists have set\nSome have suggested that there is there was a a there is was there was a second genesis that took place in the beginning in the beginning God created having the euro got also created at heaven and have been and having in heaven and earth and earth and earth an earth meaning there\nWere several genesis\nUh beginnings several different ones ah where\nThere's a fifty percent chance of of the life forms which opposed the norm and they do exist and sometimes they show up and when they show up we don't know what you call the window wouldn't do it I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster I'm not going to any of those things I'm Talking about things that you know you look at them and you get a second look\nLike this chicken that swim so it's a chicken feed is set chicken monster\nType creature that I have in my uh uh I have in my article tonight uh but when you're looking at the multiplicity of creation and you're looking at how the diversity of the multi versus unseen and the multiplicity\nBeing chips would call that the underworld creatures from the underworld they'll come up from nowhere like the Demi Moore gone from you know stranger things or you know I don't know anything that extreme but still I mean stranger things called the upside down we called the abyss uh\nThe timeline of creation and the ... we here too are the ones that have been handed down through millennia and each one is unique it's interpretation of where the\nConcepts pretty much are the same wherever you look so scientists are speculating sciences are speculating that strange organisms that might be alien in nature exist on the planet\nAnd ... there isn't\nA very far jumped to suggest that stranger life exist on the planet that well you've never seen before\nAnd yet if you were to blow up in the shadow biosphere looks every monster invite opening that no one even wants to see or or take on or have contact with there was another creature that I saw that somebody was kind enough\nTo actually send me a picture of this thing it's called the penguin\nI don't know if you've ever seen a penguin but I saw\n... today for the first time I never heard of a pain Glenn in my life it looks like a mini Godzilla with armor let's say somebody from a Japanese horror film tiny thing it looks like a cross between an anti during an armadillo\nAnd uh so he says well bring up the ... will apply to push the ... is terrifying but I I think the penguin it's cute but it's also scary looking 'cause I have this armor all over its body and it kinda like conscious over like God village looks like a good pick out to\nYou know it it was big enough he could take out Tokyo that that's how we're to this see these ... we're creatures that nobody has seen before or they've seen them or they can\nBut didn't know what they are and this is what I mean by second genesis these are things that you know you've heard of unicorns yeah right well you know this is a lot different than my I think is different in that okay\nYou know and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the flight with monster these are things that you see and you're like going what the hell is death and it's something that's never been seen\nOn in search of someone's never been talked about on coast to coast am nothing that you know I've talked about really that I that I Know about that I've seen and you know that ... this reminds me of the myths gave the movie the mist remember the ...\nIt was a it was a ... veil and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that\nYou know there are some quantum joke\nScience can beat us with dimensional theories that point to the possibility\nThat there are areas of planet wear the veil is thinner or\nThere's some extra dimensional vortex where a second genesis occurred parallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to be the most powerful due to their position to be the appropriate ritual perform there by the writer fish it could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet\nIt could open the best new creatures could come out and take I mean we're being warned\nThat there are wormholes reporter was that could be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like CERN and those real into these can pass through and hot mankind and change the direction of the future\nAnd as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead arrowhead project and the whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach\nProject arrowhead actually creates this myth and rain than enveloped the small town and during the night large insect like creatures are seen and Tara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pets eventually these creatures attack humans as well\nThose horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great with ours and they can only be described as deadly spider like predators each about the size of a small dog\nAnd these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like cloth and flesh and both the book in the film great widow where's simply killed their prey would they're acidic ... put it in the film\nThey also have the ability to capture and hundreds of eggs in a living human host\nThe eggs say goodbye the data hatch and they multiplied quickly now the looks of these creatures were terrifying and there were even some\nThat were the size of a human being rubber ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know the adult Toro did the show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies because of the fact that this is Roach or whatever it is\nGets to me the size of the human and you get to see it looks like a man and black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature see when you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in\nThe movie like mimic these creatures are terrifying and and and you know if they're the size of a human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay of the movie and then they said we based many of the creatures\nOn supposed second genesis creatures that were proposed by science\nThey were based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals from a more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still basically just animals\nMade of flesh and blood nothing supernatural about them okay but they are from\nA second genesis ecosystem\nThe brutal ecosystem is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and when a guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about\nWith regard to opening dimensions and allowing these vile creatures in for study journey rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave\nWhich is the Canadian company sewing machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects to solve certain problems hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers\nAnd rose is also the c._e._o. of kindred systems or kindred AI which is to sell the start up your founded with others that was back in twenty fourteen and he dedicated the whole company to delivering advanced tell operated autonomous robots but\nHis goal is within the way of quantum computers he wants to summon a tsunami of demons or aliens or whatever they are the equivalent he says to the old ones spoken of\nBy horror author H. P. love craft so the concept of opening the dimensions for some love crafty and like creatures\nTo come through sounds very much like he wants to open the realms of where the second genesis took place\nAnd and I mean I played the the the Ted talked before we talked about this I don't know if it's for air because I think he swears in it but he says something to eat faqih says well what I'm going to tell you is is that we have the power that we are going to bring things over but they're not going to be like us\nHe says alien you know or you know different the the things that we're building are not going to be people they might be really smart they might be really good at all sorts of things but they're not going to be like us they're gonna be aliens they're gonna be I'm Sorry to say waste smarter\nThan every single person in this room in ways that we can't even comprehend so this of course triggers a lot of alarm with people right I mean\nYou must says you know if you're playing with AI you're opening up these dimensions you're unleashing the demon the little guy you know with the ... you're going to have to throw your holy water on it you're gonna have to wave at it and say by God it's going to do exactly what you say not anything else but see that it doesn't always work out that way right\nSo you're copying his attitude that something will happen if you don't mess with Mother Nature\nSo opening up the wormhole letting these creatures through was a very very very terrifying prospect\nAnd it's something that we really really shouldn't be doing what they're going to be doing it anyway and so the question is what is out there that does not fit the mold that we can see that one day we do see and when we see it\nIt's it's it's just too much [noise]\nHave you seen anything like that [noise] I mean have you seen something I mean look [noise] I'm not asking you to tell me about something that's the supernatural I'm Talking about real monsters here I'm Talking about things that you've never seen before you can explain [noise]\nI knew as you send to video because I'm trying to find the videos and people are demanding a C shape ship big they say all credible evidence to\nI've been trying to send it over and over and over ...

O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners\nUm the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere and we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the uh soil because it's been sponge to and it would outcast and ... with thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in most places there is a north\nOf Mel oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but\nYes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the all but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country but\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing\nI'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people [noise] um I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question [noise]\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese though because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and uh because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um hold\nOn Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign up no go zone or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to goes to um ... um\n\n\n\nAnd now look back at this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen ... sixty three year old schoolteacher named any medicine Taylor becomes the first person to take the plunge over Niagara Falls in a barrel was helping to assistance Taylor strapped herself into a leather harness inside an old wouldn't heckle narrow five feet high and three feet in diameter\nKnock violently from side to side by the rapid than them propelled over the edge of ...

Kennedy announces a U.S by plane had discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba\nKennedy announced that he was ordering an evil quarantine of Juba to prevent the leadership transporting anymore offensive weapons to the island what was known as the Cuban missile crisis essentially ended on October twenty eight when the Soviets announced they would dismantle and remove all weapons in Cuba and\nThis week in twenty twelve Lance Armstrong is formally stripped him seven Tour de France titles he won from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand five and banned for life from competitive cycling it was a dramatic\nFall from grace from the one time global cycling icon to inspire millions of people after surviving cancer that's your look back at this week in history\n... fire archive of thirty for thirty dollars for\nOn line and when you get off my safely and in complete control my you know combined secure communications with private browser virtual credit card users thing you can search and\nShocking sounds socialize the outcome I think if I let her get out the sound email more credit card again usually like you know identity to stay safe secure that down them my alarm store and get one you're free to listen to news radio one\nThousand Katie okay at home or at work at ... dot gum [noise]\n[noise]\n\nWell go back to coast to coast Robert Zubrin with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] well [noise]\nI'd say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise]\nUm I mean in terms of manned space flight or you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they get launched a small space station which we did not have them\nAnd do they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um\nThey can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay\nIt's once again um there's a new paradigm now and then these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one there at the time at one tenth the cost and if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access\nNational space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh solely who once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nBut it's right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons\nOkay I mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that I mean it's such a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right\nAnd um and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars\nIt will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the workings tips walk to go\nAnd um you know he once upon a time\nYou really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of proportions rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds ah they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel [noise]\nYou get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper\nTo fly to orbit [noise] um that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\n... you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets um that is using fusion\nPower to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nHey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as ...\nI'm Wondering will inflate yet there if we find someone until you live do we really have the right to invade like the American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead I'm okay All right well here's the thing um [noise] there\nThere isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong this you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we get destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more\nAnd I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen\nYou know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the ... is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think\nThough that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail\nOr that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions uh being launched a ... in the very near future that is because a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now [noise]\nAh it has some value\nAnd uh and and and the exchange for those claims people could get a exploration missions finance\nMine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable [noise]\nProfiles people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back well or let them finish up Joe's questions there and the

I'm ... fish and I just have a question on your thought to be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you in Anchorage privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you looking at just allowed to be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you ... the government should do some more involved in\nIt hating how a possession of real poverty as it was would be if we ever got a point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left her\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of ... so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and people all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better\nWell if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government or the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments they'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good idea if someone could be bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas\nThat are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will walk there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my front always great talking to you Robert ...

us a little bit about your work and then we're going to die just ... into the Gulf studies for what he was an overview of what you've been doing random\n[noise] well um you know I ah I have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part of things\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going in and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with a ghost studies and you know I'm sure that listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes land counters\nOr oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as a loose the nation's interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes so individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with\nTelevision shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is so you know there's millions of people out there including myself who were looking for things OR Books with more than just ghost stories tales of locations are outdated views\nAnd that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters um it ... the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nEven experience and you know and you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd it's and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes down awful conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities\nAnd that's when I came up with some of these maybe theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my I took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of\nPiece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters a book\nWell then you bring to do some real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics\nThey're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm In tangle man and non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on\nBut I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't have you concluded today Brandon about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of the ghost encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them\nWhy did they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take the more by ... view on goes\nSo that's um inside is basically um telepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of ghostly counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in or being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call a a tele Patrick distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real it was a real important part of it goes way and count\nHow important then is the person as opposed to the vet or something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of it goes link counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst that he goes the encounters a so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it's sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send\nA distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is like the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an operation of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt passed\nAway right on time that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying\nSomehow she sent I'm a ... Patrick distressing they'll thing ah to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um what environmental\nSensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity warrior mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affects certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\n[noise] [noise]\n\nWhen it happens it happens here [noise] news radio one thousand Katie okay [noise]\n\nAnd somebody you don't want to have to be able to come in but they should be thinking\nThat's a decision you shouldn't have to me [noise]\nLifted financially and so it allows you to give singular focus to your child\nKnown hospital that takes care of their patients has thoroughly [noise]\nThat was the first thing I like how are we going to do that when they told us that we didn't have to pay the thing about I was like wow [noise]\nThey pretty much stay dry\nJust like the world has been lifted off your shoulders and now your focus is supporting this chow [noise]\nMarried now and I have to see\nThe patient care is magical\nIt saved my life [noise]\nSay my daughter's like you said family\nSaint Jude children's research hospital finding cures seating children learn more at Saint Jude ...

glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even skier due to\nUm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm a I live\nIn sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and I'm a one morning a you know my wife was out of town and I'm\nOne morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon and I said why is why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah well you know my scientific brands going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it\nYou know and I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and me went outside and the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in their lives\nYou know it's dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I found myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nAnd I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there some sort of like distress signal sent to me with the cat and distressing they've kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kinda like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many ... experiences occur Brandon because the person who died comes back never had someone tune as business had they had the tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staff of a father or something like\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nDo the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that's sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ...\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exists the memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like or your father showing up and saying\nWe sat I'm at a better place you know and and I think the thing\nI the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nIt's huge yeah yeah yeah\nIt it perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from it deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual and perhaps apple versions could be sort of a way\nThe process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of a survivor you know a final goodbye from the disease could help us move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and well and when I talked to this these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of the loved one death after the evaporation\nAnd I think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of a ghost counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons things like\nA brand and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters than others what's so special about though\n[noise] that that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biological is different about them you know when they put them\nThere's there's some cats out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like that like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing this phenomenon exist and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing I found out after MRI's jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting\nThis electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for but we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout the mirage as well so you you you know I might get\nHooked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that\nDoesn't hurt at all say with those brand and we're going to talk more when we come back last will take phone calls get another couple of

about your work Brendan if anything\n[noise] um [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about goes are interested in the bay of most people will tell me a story\n[laughter] and they've all got one don't think they do and I was really shocked you know you gotta sit back and got away when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive you know there's\nThere's still some colleagues you'll come up to go you know I don't tell me a story but then they follow it up with you can't do any water or anything like that\nBut the response has been pretty positive you know something that's really fascinating and it I mean it's a mystery it's been intriguing for human you know the dawn\nOf time you know it's true\nYou know it's not that out of context\nAnd listen I mean parents college he is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline\nDisliked social psychology and neuro psychology it's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh where I studied as a top twenty five university they're the ones that clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is\nFor those of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lotta people\nWhat's up through the ... you don't have the

going on and those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're\nUm in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like where the poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call to goes moving objects when they can physically touch them and things like that I really don't know the answers to that\nUm so you know it it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nMore new rules seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nShe should give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep when I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning a soft glowing light appeared next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious\nThe next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child standing my accent died the night before unexpectedly his\nDeath occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time so this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it illustrates the role of a lot but the or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing a tense emotional shift is related to the process of dying in a in a way sent up\nHello Patrick distress message to his ... ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witnessed I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message tell a path ugly if you want to think about like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration side phenomenon but also bags that question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do this while\nOh yeah yeah\nI it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and I'm a ghostly encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all think electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well and the animals\nShe does so you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment\nIt's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant in all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a poultry guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always president as well since since the first ghostly encounter ever\nUm you know it and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the Mets have always been linked you know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating maps can actually cause a ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghostly encounter on the other side of that\nThere was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and go see encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that a ghost is president you know for the EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking\nThe belief is obviously that that that goes a whereas if you have a fluctuating EMS next to a dishwasher you can probably say well that's a dishwasher [laughter]\nUm so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields very cool very entangled with ghostly encounters even when I hear he's real life goes encounter some people will say you know uh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up for I felt the room felt energized\nAre like are there was it felt like a of electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nGo to Jason in St Louis Missouri things started hey Jay\nMorning George Brian question or do you believe this fear [laughter] hide you in walls and listen and watch what we're seeing in and do we\nDo they hide in ... ... ... you\nKnow I I don't think so you know and and and this is obviously just my opinion um there's no way to definitely prove this but but I don't see it goes that sort of I'm hanging around all day watching us you know like a TV um I I see\nThe ghostly encounters and paranormal experiences happening at certain times in certain events for certain reasons like the the Halloween thing we talked about before there's some sort of need for that interaction\nAnd sometimes when people have interactions with there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience with some guys\nYou know there's that intelligent haunting that's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in in sometimes that falls into an earth balance spirit but I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us and way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for that goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know if it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe teach them Rochester New York Yankees\nWith the original and the entire thirty for\nThe screen is Marilyn or
