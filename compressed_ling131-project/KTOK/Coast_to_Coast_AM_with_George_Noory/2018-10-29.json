like lizard man I remember reporting blizzard band as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA as an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chasing central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so now the area very well and it's a it's a large area a lot far east\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be sort of hotspots for her normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just saying you know that'd be coming out his window areas where it seems every image brother goes through you know ... times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post\nAnd somebody it's saying this um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use the words are at high speed you know kind of\nLike a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of point classrooms\nIn the sixties or with a ... some kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to press one of them even spoke to the local police so I don't really know what the police can be done about it it's um [noise]\nBut he really intriguing that you know you have this weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting a lot to do manage to find some black dogs and also a large black cats as well\nI'm I think for that reason um you know that's the I think that's the responsible way to do it it's just sort of look at the data and and share each and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say and if I got out and says I tell people if I don't have an says I'll tell them\nYou know ... or ... or or possibility um [noise]\nYou know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of\nThe movie which I don't believe it said by the way [laughter] books um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you call that's called bats watch and you share that with us\n[noise] well yeah the ... the ... or is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees that more than anything else is something that\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but this particular case there's an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four eighty Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my ... and the witness a minute I'm young man named Brian Khan failed\nI'm a solo these strange ... he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid with a huge wings\nBut it was kind of ... areas well scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair and go combined with a large wings um you know they have the body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he caught it looks a bit like ... ...\nAnd um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases it just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you ... up to five books now I'm On this phenomena foreign them out in black and one of the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports\nI get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies that typically are described as looking ... you know go on and skins live ... white white\nUm and people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nPaper they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that fateful and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black and turned up in homes right after pay for using wage of boats which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X. files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe based but many black mistreat it's far beyond you know just guys in a black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nTruly seem like they are humans that are\nCarrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the cat will be a ... you know you've got a really weird lung and exploit couple and then some which ah Asia apps to explain the recent powerless with the ... black where there's\nNo doubt that in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for that might be but I think it's a very small catch agree versus the the January unexplained ones and the way it was what I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this is the\nOver the years agencies may actually employed the elections of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words\nThe ... paper within governments who know that many black are all too real but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the ... the most chafe resumes too to threaten and quiet people who [noise] who if I may not want to have them talking about cases so the government might actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully\nBut that sort of leads us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that ... latest book\nOr whether or not you believe the abductions are real the files on the leading abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the\nOr real life or

George Burns hassle true and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls opened on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI but yes they ... they are and see Israel eons but they told\nThe FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on communism\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file 'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... she was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he was the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and a hill that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get waited a they don't feel writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft with Akeley strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomena where they knew follow Jake what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report it to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services there was sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that what's interesting is that in the ... it talks about how the\nThey ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with the with the cops came to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling intriguing aspect is that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to be strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together but has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of amused meant well there there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and when the Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government use really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist the UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers of land they published in the early fifties\nThat that sold him huge figures of gigantic numbers of books with salt um and I have a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on a damn skate um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle and I'm\n[noise] three years

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and\nCultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this on the move here in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are you now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real\nSense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so I've tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi first with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and the Braves with ... with a sense of a mystery in and wonder\nI think of those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for new spiritual infections and I and I um and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time relating normally Georgia through\nThat [laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you've sort of reached out look kind of look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of ... with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it's it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one\nYeah I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for\nThem for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimensions three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um since Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world an on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction in space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line is a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd that there's something else as the drinking part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on so and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you\nStill have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise] uh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of the audience her string theory\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a at but we'll we'll get into that in a moment or we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors break on through take us into the

book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story yeah\nYeah yeah yeah he his wife has this quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual intuition and his ... am\nAnd with wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual low levels are worlds to reality um hinted incomes an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation as he he embraces map Madison geometry as a kind of a and he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think his his stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nScientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and you write these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes I give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake slips or deja blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one sided ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a vat\nOf that book but she talks about time slips and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nWell for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time has probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe at all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block we are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy little portion of that block but every moment\nHuh and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and then our son future\nAnd and all of our defending future's all of those moments already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics [noise] um and and this is actually a discussion Scott if anyone wants to look at it discussed in my book but you can also look at Brian Greene book he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it lays out these big issue right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices um and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book good as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more possible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nThe dreaming felt he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and done believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space last for their um that's what he believed to happen in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as an additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have you thought everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that every one of the cabin kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they follow you had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and after that I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we've discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away takes us into the

dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world all them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab us and pull it up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even if you talk about you know God in Christ higher dimensional hum and as being that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the fear that that in in an avid book ... oh\nYeah people definitely thought about um what we thought about\n... from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional hum and as I was kind of these higher dimensional objects that are within certain cells into our world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have\nYou know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices in the book\nUm you know talking about\nWhat the meaning of these events are and and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider and tuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on\nAnd and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right who have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to\nHe went to sort of like popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I Try to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example are reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right some people have been trying to\nTo reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right on ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and at other times you know Americans use psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believed it was like a doorway of consciousness into another realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the gyms to\nTo reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely they're all different\nAll different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other a parent I came on and\nOn a ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a lengthy than wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in ... and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat square sliding around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle on he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land\nCan just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of his two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly a he suddenly has powers of vision and he never had right he can look down at flat line he can see for the first time\nNot just lines that he can see A People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines he can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside ride it say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle\n'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he could even see inside the tri leading the inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because some\nPeople have used to say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right wing raised to hire dimension we would look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look\nDown on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out now you can see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside that one's body you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision\nUm and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talk about having this kind of um having this kind of special vision where they can see things I never saw before [noise]\nSo so yeah and so maybe remote viewing is a a you know is a higher dimensional phenomena but I don't know you know I'm\nCertainly\nPeople have talked about it that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and then the epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences and some parents Paris psychological phenomena like like feeling\nYeah Raymond Moody is somebody I've met in uh oh yeah I was in an interview and it's just you know he's a trailblazer in in discussing that those experiences in so many people have had and trying to put it in context and this I think this kind of idea makes it easier to understand those experience yeah\nYeah I looked at his his books to ah he's he's really interesting I Love the book\nUm I looked at as books too because I was studying um near death experiences for like the epilogue of the book in the last couple of chapters of the book and you know what you do find or what I found\nIs that people do use this kind of language you know they it's almost like they talk like the square and flat land as as a character you know as a character who suddenly lifted off of\nYou know they're limited world they're they're lower dimensional world into some sort of higher dimensional space and many of them use language like um\nYou know suddenly there I saw an altered geometry before me I'm ... and the dimensions of the room changed and shifted and\nOthers talk about being able to see like in a hospital setting right if someone had a near death experience in a hospital setting others talked about rising up above the hospital setting and being able to see into different rooms in the hospital so once again another case in which\nUm you know you you're raised into a higher spatial dimension and then you can suddenly have these incredible powers a vision that you didn't have before right you can see through walls right you can see in places that you're not um\nSo yeah people people and Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do sometimes use the language of higher dimensions to talk about what they experience\nI'm not to say on says in the same category but you do a address say on this and that people's attempts to reach a higher power or another world um\nChampionship cybersecurity\nJoins ... renovations for cocktails and ...\nTired of crafting candy that seems to\nBe like no don't miss out on solving thousands of\nTons Asian with
