appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big but does it feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it in your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like big foot when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but it wouldn't have to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago when your first year he recap the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and to the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that\nIndependently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the heroes\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years as a police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me no year for kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd what the showed was that the bypass it went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side to the ... Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation and they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people\nHelp her white a white paper about this [noise] and during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could've been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce Melba to a very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listened to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it [noise]\nAnd unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper but if you extract all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't\nIn Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten ... tell a story that's phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big what ... air take us into the break\n\nUm Harry and\nYou know [noise]\nKnown me\nIn here every day for a rainy a one thousand to gain the green yeah did\nYou use money\nOver twenty second was new to down the Bree I our radio shack out I was on her radio resent inside the city out during a brand new episode with the legendary sir Paul McCartney\nNone of them and treat them all down when you're ... you're talking about his new album Egypt and then of course some discussion about a little band called the ... we were sees when we were playing music my heart radio present duty I'll check it out now\nYou lost ESPN slots to ... and under the shows are\nWith the original and the entire thirty to survive\nYou are severe weather leader use radio one\n[noise]\n\n\nWhere's the\n\nLine [noise]\nJak covered with\nIn\nJail [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] ...\nWhen\n\n\nThis news goes to goes to me in with your you know [noise]\nOkay so does that mean against me we we were looking for some songs written about big but there are several uh I Would have to\nPut it this way they'll be definitive big put song has yet to be written that one [noise] by uh burrows mess\nWas supposedly written by Johnny Cash and that's when it says on line I'm Still not sure that that's true\nBut uh it's interesting tune and interesting attempt at an anyway we're talking with David polite us\nAbout his new book big wild man and giants are tied articles sixty and eighty to Nineteen twenty two there are hundreds of them hundreds of credible stories about a different creatures that look sort of like an animal and look sort of like a man and close up encounters including some famous people\nAnd we're going to hear some of those stories are in a moment we're going to continue our conversation about the DNA evidence that they politeness help to uncover with Melba catch them in just a moment here on coast to coast am [noise]\n... to ... and I thought I had I lodged top these hot dish and he's also the biggest killer decided to stop talking kind of Laura\n... is just incredible feeling that I never ... pins and needles ran my hot when I have the extra auditor and to know how long slide on something amazing which will taste while I might not actually contract almost staggering it that this was the staging a cheaper come check the ...\nHe kind of law sweet ... results coming for like a kind of are very close to excuse the pun on\nA regular networks beautifully on a Richard hospital here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system says he'll this gentleman's hon perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies seriousness powers to he'll visit\nC.

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the ...\nIt's and even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have Howard while or giant human bone\nAnd that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiarity with the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat tropical with you I Know and I think people are scratching\nBring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise] um and and the parts of the country where these things are saying you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAt and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nBut the said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter it's a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was like yeah\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went in to the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what may be some explorers wrote about that they hurt in which he encountered so\nBut again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the Watergate church was\nComing across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore notes that\nThis thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I I actually spoke\nTo him large hairy by ... he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things happen happen Dickey with\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from shock valet you wrote about it and I have a clip from September Seventy sixteen eighty it was a report it in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass\nLanded in a field releasing a huge error covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on a about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of it\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big for topic it was a starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and

years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey brat\nA these look like humans faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are they\nLooked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that a\nSort of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to see the find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film and it's you know if people can argue about all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been to bump but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo one I did with a good one film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet\nIs let's say somebody goes into a bank robbed the bank has a beard on has a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving Harvey has this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSo you can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Dick foot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made in probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine or of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows what what was what we understand about our own people\nYeah fewer ... came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from its 'cause we we buried so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's campfire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seeing them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big foot that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on it for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nIf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get them of just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot\nAnd why aren't the names there and if somebody is writing about it since it\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only do they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we use the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of\nThe big for the world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and a invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm [noise] and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows yeah what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge stir and he went out there and talk to them and it's oh I think he's eight years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in a while my cat will come back we're completely no\nAnd go [laughter] I don't understand it [laughter] then the same\nMan told them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my TV and all the [noise] and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner the property got their\nSo called dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing because I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of\nBerries and different kinds of fruit um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer terror there an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across here that stuck up on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it\nThey don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did he get their\n... big foot wild bend a giants is the book in a moment

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film\nOf anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute now think about today nobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on that PG film yet\nToday there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone which has the ability to catch that\nSo I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe that Paterson film is real why haven't we caught despite that on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven there was something phenomenal about that event\nThat caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this when did they won't hang around and linger knowing that people are watching them something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back your skin Walker day but it did the comparison is a pretty clear is that ... there was a loose if there were cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and send a camera that would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes the you mentioned in your book suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that he can poke itself the changes shapes and you can hide\nCorrect that's again one of the reasons that makes this entire different topic difficult to research\nYeah I mean we see it when it wants to be seen I guess\nYeah\nTrying to get one more call in Tom in Vancouver up there in the country have Tom how're you doing\nIs ... ...\nI think Tom has gone uh okay so we're about out of time to have a great work or the title being sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two does that suggest that another a book of archived articles about these sightings could come some other time\nWell not really know and and just so everyone knows that this is a book that contains the actual article these aren't re rights of the articles this is the real deal Nineteen twenty two was cut off point for copyrights on those articles oh\nWise or then you could print them after them because for\nA while it's a terrific a piece of work uh I Love reading it I I Want to go back and read it again because there's so many details that escaped me as I was preparing for the

and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigate abuses that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court I'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book gray Debbie year\nGreat to be here thanks George\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen I'm most teenagers are Thirteen or not reading about the US's Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of the ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carried the bomb and sunk\nAnd I had to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought oh someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so\nYou know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it\nAnd you know FlashForward graduated from college and then we'll know ones pulled the story and you know the right way yet\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me in kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their story teller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd when for you how did you ah hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project for me the way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm\nI Do pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah ...\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that I'm In being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since ... brothers but we only base mini series\nOn foot so you're going to need to ride the bus I fall she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff so very family and friends she reached out and and they contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um\n[noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my joke\nIs is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but uh eventually over the course of several months\nWe finally met and then uh we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it to the project because the and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people that were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on and so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nBut I'll tell you grab me ... my father was a at ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes the you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah\nMentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm a small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us in our where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was the case of hitting in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen

Japanese commander a little bit\nYeah a commander lieutenant commander astronaut and saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way um [noise] meaning that they were acting\nOut if they're sincere conscious conviction and um we were able to make great use ...\nUm\nWell with it and then more for published after the war is nice to Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt and the uh here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from men or ... point of view and there was a chapter on a boat and Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger or in the end of World War two in general we were able to really develop its personality a lot he was scared for his men\nFanned it was very very frustrated with state of technology on Japanese submarine and really against a call at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic hopped on military\nUm he went around saying on doors at radar and more technology that Marines because that means that Marie didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and said he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of it is rather sad commanders\nKnow Lynn and I both heard yeah tend to stories of just men and yes\nHaving their buddy right next to them taking you know and they they didn't know who the sharks were going to attack that was not a real rhyme or reason to it and so they were always in fear and one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nAnd there was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of\nThe rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were\nPulling the men from the water the shark attack increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that'd be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so thick\nThey could walk on their back you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could have there's stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down things drugs thinking oh there's mood I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young EMT and by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was going to wiggle his toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to its senses at the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippine see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen\nRap between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's\nRight so so there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding out the torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then others would you know take mall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels for\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nCouldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it did sunk quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off you have a ... pilots who ends up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention or we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting and general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd you know the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still went to you know he asked a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area\nDon't worry about it and so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer live Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he\nActually had diary entries of the time and coordinate said when he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when word worth released about it that he would\nWe are talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors and what came next is a really amazing we'll be right back\nTo ... just log on to goose ... dot com\n\n\n[noise] my name is Joe Tom I'm twenty nine years old and they have a career that I

three six eight seven three five\nMobile home was news radio station one thousand deal gay [noise]\n\n\n\nWind Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of ... through the cracks or that made their survival even more improbable\nWell as Sarah mentioned there with the the um departure message that didn't\nThrough from ... to the Philippines there was a tenant on the Philippines side who had received a message saying that if\nA ... at the combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and I as a matter of fact had received a fitness report saying as match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to reporter rivals the combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report non arrivals either\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the pending invasion at the Japanese home island so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combine to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I pd one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors just find it in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books or a about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and tried to uh give these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to head back and there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left and your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and\nYou know speaking to him and these men reading their testimonies later on it affected than the rest of their lives like they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know our ship or else the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and get on that was a burden they carry till the end of their life\nYou know it's wartime as ... said the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but uh [noise] is it an accident that this story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day and well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the time did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August fourteenth ... between the time zones fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil the jade de until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five I mean Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over\nThen maybe below the fold in a very small article you at the Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time believe that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in a lot of almost nine hundred men on the very brink of the end of the war\nSyria talked to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable could let him slide given that the war had just ended or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan are over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this on the streets but their family is now grieving that their son or their brother their uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who is involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the thinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame and a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there with a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented this situation and so really you know at the time the name ... you know admiral king ... limits and all these these men who were\nEssentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and and\nThe American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify in tarnish their name like I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel for the moment that he was brought to cart court marshal there\nWas nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little let's talk about the court marshal
