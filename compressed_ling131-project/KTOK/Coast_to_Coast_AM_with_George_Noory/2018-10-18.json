please go ahead on high\nAre you are incredibly articulate and in that they enjoy listening to you you get to ask for ... and very quickly thank you thank you think\nAbout what I'd like to say is you know I keep hearing about that the media lying and\nThat's all we get is there information they you know they're dominating the news surface all liars well why don't we get more stations than Fox and get a bunch of competing conservative stations because I keep hearing people call in and say\nWell I don't have a concert at station where I live but\nWe'll see are you going to go on I'm not see our TV you checked she our TV\nYou're going to check some news match dot com one American network out to check with your cable company I think see our TV does a great job Fox I Can't watch Shepard Smith

watching mark on Sunday night but there's there's parts of Fox that that I Can't watch and it's because if I Wanna watch Shepard Smith crap I'll watch MSNBC instead I'm also get the true thing but but I I and I worry about Fox long term\nBecause of the drift of what it's doing and it concerns me but I I\nLike more information not less than ... when I tell you what I Do Chris I get up\nAnd I check

for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there is information out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your own Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI have great except what I refer to is the mainstream media where people don't have the talent jazz and meet they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the fence they don't want for conservatism is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I tell you what would happen money controls everything if CBS or ABC said\nFrom top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system we're gonna have conservative viewpoints on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings\nSkyrocketing say at CBS News if they determine they're gonna do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our TV if CBS would say we're going to cover news objectively moderate\nTo the right side of things wouldn't they make billions of dollars\nBecause you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same news casts every night at six thirty if one of them would go against the fracas and reflect the values the once and the whims and the wishes of the majority of the American people wouldn't we be better off and when they make a lot of money\nYeah well where are the people that are being proactive enough to do that to get into the mainstream these radio shows and his TV 'cause they're faking to the choir we need

Fox News secretary's day my palm pale back from Saudi Arabia in Turkey where he met with leaders to discuss the disappearance of journalists ...\nIn jammed remember that remember that night I think I was at night okay this is my memory is it's kind of faulty right now\nOkay so so okay so\nThe whole Russia thing from Russia Today I went to look for the notes and nothing found nothing so something weird happened last night too and this is this is a this is from a read a page All right uh reading is reporting\nThat there was a fall worldwide shutdown of YouTube last night there was because we were having a hard time preparing our showed that gives a lot of the stuff we use for a montage as in for\nA music in liners and stuff we get the new to the audio from you too we couldn't get audio last night for a lot of things because you to shut had been shutdown full worldwide shutdown of YouTube\nAnd there are rumors flying around as to why this outage happened and one of the chief rumors is and I'll read it directly from a [noise] for this and this is from\nRead it okay if anyone has the footage of the man in uniform warning of an impact on the moon last night before you to shut down and took it off please share\nSo the rumor is that YouTube\nHad to shut down a viral video of a man in uniform there was pointing out that the moon was about to be struck by something\nOr he didn't say what it was he didn't have ... people say they thought it was like it had a hundreds of thousands of hits and then it was taken down and then all of a sudden you to shut down\nOkay\nSo that's a mystery that's tacked onto this you know I was notified\nBy an email\nA guy named Scott who told me I got to go back and see answered my email or Scott told me he says have you seen this video he was mentioning the video he said it to me like five six teen\nOkay okay\nAll right so he said have you seen this video and and I didn't know what he was talking about All right so you to shut down to the moon get hit by an asteroid or was it as a cyber attack here's another Youtube video saying was shut down because of this whole moon thing\nOkay\nSo I mean I'm getting now I'm getting bombarded with emails and all kinds of other pointers and and and references to what happened last night with you to shut down\nUh [noise]\nSo that's something that's mysterious something had crashed on the moon and they didn't want anybody you see it hit the moon so they shut down YouTube to keep people from watching it 'cause it was going viral\n[noise] now\nIt's like I said that sounded like a lot of science fiction disinformation right and and the fact that you can go back and reference things but I Do know what I talked about two nights ago I Do know I played those homes I Do know that I played a frequency that was being sent by the so called armada\nAnd\nThis armada apparently that sounds coming from is shut down the radio stations across the country now YouTube shuts down okay it's back up again today but all this reminded me of an old science fiction film called earth versus the flying saucers and what happens in that film\nIs that rockets and missiles and satellites all get shut down because the aliens are planning to arrive there plenty of land\nAnd so I got to thinking about what's been happening in the past few days first of all the Russian rockets so use MS can\nFeel the launch on its way to the IOC says according to a statement that was released by NASA\nThe so use that as ten spacecraft launched from about can cause a drum conflicts done to the international space station for forty ... am eastern daylight time Thursday October eleven or carrying American astronaut Nick Kagan Russian cause not alec C O inch in\nShortly after launch there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted resulting in a ballistic lending of the spacecraft\n\nLaunched appeared to be going smoothly but about Ninety seconds later\nNASA on his live stream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation the space agency tweeted that ballistic descended above the sharper angle of landing compared to normal the castle containing the abstract successfully separated from the rocket booster\nAnd parachute into the ground with the rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nShutting down about sending information back but\nThe Chandra X ray observatory when did the same boat and all that all the science operation is a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space telescope\nShut down due to a gyroscope failure\nAccording to the agency ... a transition at the same boat was possibly triggered by an issue that also had something to do with this gyroscope the component in charge of pointing and stabilizing the telescope however there are some investigators and those are into deep space conspiracy theory they're saying that something is happening in space that NASA does not want us to see\nAnd ... and and just out of coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover hits temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so that we can't see anything from Mars\n\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bulletin hasn't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense coordination ops are offices\nTwo year old a two year old the organization that NASA's it's NASA's planetary defense coordination office two years old it started with a budget\nIt started with a small budget and now it's gone to overnight and they they spiked it to a hundred and fifty million dollar budget for this a planetary defense coordination office\n\nFirst of all there was Ninety million dollars I wouldn't know sixty million dollars I went from sixty million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars overnight and says you're amid growing concerns of humanity is utterly unprepared for the unlikely but still an ... an asteroid strike of climate it's proportions\nThe White House has also recently issued a new national near earth object prepared to strategy an action plan intended to energize a host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nSo Ninety million more dollars I mean we're not that concerned about why is it the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars hundred and fifty million dollars\nSecondly why issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize a host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something isn't right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really scary B horror science fiction film it sounds like a war of the world scenario it sounds\nToo weird to be real but it is real it's happening I mean these these shutdowns I mean remember the sunspot observatory was shut down on September Six twenty eighth team and then all this stuff is good chicken shut it got to remember all the other space observatory to shut down after the September ... shut down in New Mexico\n\nI mean these shutdowns remind me of what happens before an alien invasion well he's from a science fiction perspective I mean and I don't I don't want I don't want it to be about this but I guess it all depends how you look\nAt what is going on around you and everything around us is is is is it just it sparking a lot of anxiety I was feeling really bizarre all day to day a lot of tension in my neck a lot of ah I I couldn't concentrate\n\nI couldn't concentrate something was up and then when I'm reading all of these posts saying did you see the video of the man in uniform stadium to the moon was about to be hit by something I said no it went all over the Internet\nClyde is what shut down on YouTube and I thought oh my God where the Shonda X ray telescopes shut down the humble shut down the rover on on a on Mars is shut down and sunspot was shut down a month ago [noise]\n\nAre they hiding from us [noise] and those Russians they said well look at this ... this was an armada\nIn in the cloud and coming in and I thought something there and they're saying but nothing happened to the moon the it's still there well they all you see a little white headlight like being in the sky and the ...\nThe footage that I was seeing from a John ex army was something far more compelling and that is something cropping would infrared day I'd be that night vision\nAnd you could see it pass on the front of a new and it was amazing so something did happen last night we just haven't found the video dad the guy in uniform that were saying something

so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court the there's no way to win is or\nWhere does the lending money come from Alan Paulos before these loans\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] uh and it sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the tax payer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this was a federal program money ultimately um comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said as making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a of something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student\nLoans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair debt collection practice laws\nFederal um a truth in lending laws [noise] uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the Nexus One this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord\nA bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system [laughter]\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] ah like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living in a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices trees in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank get any private line of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera can keep up with their budgets um you know I was\nJust in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee you now you're per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college\nAnd by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really string students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder if that's all a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and that really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and in many others are about how the student loan problem\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nNinety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be felt\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with them in college when we come

news radio one thousand Katie OK worldwide\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I've three degrees in engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there were student loans is falling into a\nIs a lineage system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my alone is very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nAh and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government\nRefused to be interviewed I might add [laughter] uh and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project to get you\nKnow justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loan center outrageous and predatory are that are geared marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that hey you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I have no student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and if you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this ... their life um\nI mean they should be getting lower interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody goes to college winds up with student loans\nBut still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the landing system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy what's what's the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools but um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running\nYou know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three for\nYou or I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen\nAnd you will cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen I don't think you\nGot good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they throw support the seals there he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it but\nUh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of trades will do\nA ... a former company I used to work where I got on big wildly when a company went under the under the company and I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know that it was a sad time but uh we pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd that was one of those people too so I'm looking for the job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone is with us or for that I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too\nWell and I think also for years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nThere and I looked at the local schools they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go for oh I think it was a horse just on while I was like there though way\nSo I ended up feeling unless the valves in dollars on the grade school are learning to drive semi trucks and then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that it's not up for about half the price now they've been talking\nA let's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook on an aircraft a dollar by the way because almost ... percent of total that his college dead\nOK I already knew to do it have positive but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is ... I'm a conservative everyone knows\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or hospital at a nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nOr the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was ... acres that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit I'm inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're going to come back

comedy or and\n... again to me Allen doesn't it do you have student loans out there gene\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors ...\nWell what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Eleanor these scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and this sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in default ... who they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loan or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas the first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHubbard George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nA job thank you and um\nOh we hear more of it before Halloween that point\nThough I'm a very interesting I've I've just had a loan and all or a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week\nI got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information has a hundred percent correct the principal was\nSixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listing a breakdown of all of a a a cost but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can get me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he charges because these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Alan what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third\nParty collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally\nA but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies I'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise]\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a very close you know like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information I'll unlucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this or a public debt clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate\nFind the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with the company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again well you\nHave to be very careful these are strong beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and you\nRelease down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they all they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave [noise]\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically for ... which is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nProblem [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in the Pentagon hall more what's

contacted the desert we were there\nAnd now what do you live event in which we\nThat was right around that same period yeah that was fun you did a great job they're\nGreat job indeed aliens at the\nPentagon I Love this title tell me more\nEssentially it is you don't you mention that I put out the story and you grab you\nSo that story and and really to to try in one dog humane tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government for ... relationship with this phenomenon of ah watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think [laughter]\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't die is the ... suffocation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades have to know all the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the super super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you're like you say for years they said no no since project Blue Book closed down we haven't been doing this this knowing trashed or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment pulls the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this but Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid charmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make honey you track all this stuff coming from all different directions\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is the particularly with ... we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the aid tip story with with these revelations um we almost have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mass if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to first than a than a third one\nBut now the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's the walk strong guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman and and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's\nThat's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film will get a lot in the course tonight Pentagon but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a logs on on on that one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course as alien times yourself you know you sit in the ... said\nA direct tucked kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I go edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did this I teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie I ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio ... you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all a together um micro loan I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and ... than\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure from a a day to completely\nNew role to me I there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose have just made a a a great movie but um you\nKnow I I it was a departure for may so to me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to go through some of the the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field\nHas is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them so by putting this out as video on demand we go on to the platforms\nThat the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those sorts\nOf things so that the the
