Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage ... imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate\nOne consequence of that will be there will not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty and then when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe that the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the United States Senate under Chuck Schumer think about that and the impact that would have on your life and my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening to Leslie stall and sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the

do not believe I Do not believe the Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington that the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful\nCompared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that's what we'd gone through the past two years to fight cholesterol and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be sink Trump at all costs sink the ss drunk and you know it and I\nKnow and so if you're in one of those a contested

neighbor is the one that is on the town now with your analysis\nYour minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid you you start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and\nI'm a review or a who was it was very well known a ... a shop here who don't we were my paper\nOr he calls his waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of fat which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get dinner but every once in a while there is a job so you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's ... peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHow around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpret it what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and in the forty two story great government how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and\nAh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the\nPyramid was not completed there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the the most prominent researchers proposed this is Robert ... father John Paul will fall and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to opinion piece in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the uh repeating of the ticker layers\n[noise] um ...\nDoes it every ten steps is that every twelve is there some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you just you know simple mine that I thought each step they were just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed pyramids with uh something called they called it set that which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how the conceptual eyes a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's little regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that uh after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is bad with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen that are decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension yeah\nWhich which Jimmy I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ...\nPublished that al ... was disappearing or during the twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade in a big dip her\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows\nThat the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper and why the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI got a

that was published last week and again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you tried three hundred ... a a scrawled on the page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a voyage we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for\nThese must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing mole and you're right I'm I'm On this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a or specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around a number of fractious of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses\nThat are associated with these round fractious tend to run a over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that has a round number facts of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces and war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth from Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that uh that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the ...\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than than the one that we just talked about is a course on the thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round facts of the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight or we have eight twenty fifth uh and that goes across a feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers insight that tower\nUm and and then the final point I Want to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here\nFound last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are but it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be um you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that\nAlso is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yeah of\nCourse we don't know exactly we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know paint that that into this illustrations just to give a rough guy\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my news see any connection between a dynastic Egyptian use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion at go Beckley tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the line and see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land and ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of go back to ... the erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go Beckley happy not an accident you\nKnow with this references of course with the lines to was low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work

Tyler just at the end\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked up perhaps\nUm so what you saw what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptians script was probably a originally Africa maybe you know what to hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south in that\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds or ... ... the Greeks adapting uh the etymology a chemistry coming from candidate\nRight yes the issue I think she mentioned it stinks oh my yeah we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think it was we were I think it was the lioness and her

a key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical\nBut for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties some\nRemote viewing him to an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples half that's been discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern\nReconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter\nI'm a new alien um they are basically recreating gives a a a ... in in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked like the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid I where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know just a simple rule that the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the uh selling\nBut what I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned\nWhat is your access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now with that I saw you\nRegarding talked about so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences where they might never met in person and he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study of Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is it ... yeah how was it was a still the director there\n... I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on a he sits on the on the uh the board of directors\nThat reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they ask of course at by a get input\nUm you know I think they're sort of mixed back here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know I was on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientist you archaeologist who loves what he does\nUm you know it's difficult to kind of saw it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects\nThat uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being safe and political right now and I understand that I knew it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot that goes down you I think right yes um yeah so I think what you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed or this\nSort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars\nThey feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know a say or they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood to be jumping right there I knew I got to take a quick network break this was coast to coast am more by new when we come back stay with us\n[noise]\n\nHe\n\nLoves to ease\nAlready using stage name a little Richard made his first recordings RCA Camden at the studios of Atlanta radio station ...

been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nA numerically that is not not in writing but in in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I've talked about and some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you know says are there any other pyramid in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTrade meaning\nBut just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that he knows referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological uh within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras\n'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\nYeah well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before it's on a\nDrop off ... as opposed to some of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not up to your media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it um\nNow you've got to anomalies in a and one is clearly defined at roe one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI acting so how big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by eight Hi I'm saying right you know maybe maybe\nA five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that notch that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and fire investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be
