[laughter] I Hope so yeah\nI'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a very careful manner very ecological manner\nI mean that's not what greed another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\nYeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now in in in ... no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in the last school it's Seventy thirty I mean think about\nReally use it that high on that's a flip flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said let's say you want you you wanna hassle of women there so you don't do it\nBut what you have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're good one I ...\nYeah oh excellent and was absolutely excellent ones and and uh\nSo we're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\nA generation Z was born ... being going right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh\nBut Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y ... they're going to be just the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially he's the parents of Gen Z\nA but it ... what we're watching is is is a ... a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these you know they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let's let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're gonna be fun to just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWhat but listen here's here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some possessions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying so\nAll and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just here about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we knew not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a name and listen I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but\nWhen you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break that's the problem yeah that's\nAnd that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so I\nThat when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's\nMore information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is it\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people at a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad and you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know you know people ... I I I Can't tell you the number of people at George that say to me I\nWhy don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know we have this huge deficits and we will make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government diplomatic government or a Republican based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles we used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's actually run on business principles and it it seems like there's there's no you know we were just ticket older we've removed the ropes what's taking away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat will what's going on with China [noise]\nChina's freaky position China right now\nThey will actually ... their their child law to write how many people many children a family can help yeah\nThey can really as many as they want now which is the absolute positive did last thing they should have done [noise] it's it's you know I don't know why I really don't and listen I Am not that smart I'm really not in in in a few few asked my wife or my kids so they'll tell you but\n[noise] it here you have a situation where we're trying to\nHold on for a second we're already at the top of the hour we'll come back and talk about China plus will open up the phone lines as we

Ken China trendy up trending down\nChina's cooked gotten it China I'm Sorry that but that's that's just I I Can't think of any any other way to say what they've done is they've they've committed ... the biggest\nDemographic blunder and a history of the world with that one child only policies they did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies\nThey're not born as adults they're not buyers that's for sure no\nSo what what you have is is they're missing now and it's this is a real number five hundred million people that were born five hundred million and a half\nBillion so here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people that make big income and have a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run attacks just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAre and the the ... the starting at about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well well it cooked himself because they're going to have is actually a quarter of a billion elderly it they've got to support that can't support themselves and now they they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen in how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble with their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's right exactly they go to war\nYeah they well they may they may not go to because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's going to happen there but but it it's it's it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there their economy is not going to war period\nNo it's not let's take some calls this hour the cover of rolling in here for you Kenny let's\nSon go to Dana in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war I'm not a ... so all of those politicians that have looked us in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian\nBut I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman bird I wanted to say do things to you\nFirst of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the\nOrange star because she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he could run and possibly win\nA presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side track\n'em a booming economy or tried to bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has kids especially a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white and ... and his wife and\nWe had a president and did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nTrump it's reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature of the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself this is men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have a meeting to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact\nThat you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy death when ward diplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him\nThe housing it's a no nonsense is is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up and get on the horse\nI thought I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in addition he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what scientists hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about his policy she knows she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so\nI disagree with you on both of those um things\nLet's give skaters comments day not in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things with anyone jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilets or you're the pay the fair market value or even try to get at the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where Lutz not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential will move more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and the uh I don't know I think what he has done his dignify but it the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who

right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a ... right and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to a a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's what the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it's it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck is parked there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that are are are is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military\nAnd the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens\nWhen you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ...\nI just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe we'd go water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nWas always missiles long journey\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I say I what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of\nThe north and the south the you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh yeah it's down like about one to\nHere's my concern though not from a country but from some terrorist group of teens new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me as a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher I guess my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most popular state ranking New York state and also a scenic such become the largest city out raking I still don't hear\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather ...\nThat that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts

returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's\n... the paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age for my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just that these things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd ah I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to\nFinally put these all these experiences together into a book and a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but uh to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college\nI'm On the paranormal if it's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\n'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was um a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide\n[laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\n[noise] I I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nOr but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rate and who's\nThe chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty five zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so\nThat's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still did J. B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it\nBut I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nAnd I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcaster is out there dealing with the paranormal uh millions a list\nAnd there's it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and\nThat's exactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um\nOur custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just it's kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in in their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that\nUh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things ah it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I ... and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen in the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know she'd be baking for a long time and just wanting to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like it it it was an angelic presence\n... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see um\n[noise] there's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in ... and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry or vote\nOr there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and then that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to would be island there is a a to bridge fans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\n... ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in the warm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling at somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's

stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately the way\nAnd and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my friends are just like a continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the ... education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific\nThan mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there there is my daughter had nobody wants to we didn't know ... yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but uh she she\nShe had the vision she was ah in in a city were ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep um but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was yeah yeah some people\nHad it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who have uh\nVerified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this this the ... that people had since that an end in a on a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think a dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but yeah he does talk about that\nWhat do you think ... the [noise] I\nI I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was younger uh ...\nUh camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a car and she looked at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was and uh ... well above chance we would get\nThe the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ...\nYou know whether it was a king or jak face card a very often we get we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop\nIf we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this it was a ... near Oric which is northern California and the redwoods highway there and a driving south and uh my girlfriend was was asleep in\nThe uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's very ...\nAs I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit\nOf a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark\nBut it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat and a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck as we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you talking about big for I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep Dr ...\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another mile from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with them that this was in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taken a big chance by stand right on the on the edge of the highway in the dark total dark\nYup uh and they can get shot at or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or you know the alternative which which you know they're so that that was my my one and only a a big foot experience\nWhat about the uh thirty four episodes that occurred with you which is the favorite for you\n[noise] well I don't want to actually it's like\nYeah I [noise] I'll have to say it all the connections with my my my parents with my mother ah when my mother came to me an inhibition after she had passed away and\nAnd uh and told me she she doesn't say much when she comes to me but she came to me and said and she was golden you know she was herself but very healthy she you know she died of cancer and she was very healthy looking she was gold and had this golden glove\nAnd uh she came to me and said you know there is a heaven that's what she told

get to your calls as well as we talk about time was the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stores you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story yeah\nThe open casket um the title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a um [noise] in our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket\nAnd he was home to me\nAnd he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay and uh I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked\nAt my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it than than the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was kind of comforting\nIn a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird wasn't it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out and\nSee what she was there very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh well do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like\nFor college transfer credit but it isn't offered at at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approach them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the nurse seven weeks in the course into the course um\nAnd uh it it it's been a wonderful experience it really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book and we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fine ah that's a\nHunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes geo Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in of ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll\nI'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey uh they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in ah in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh\nIn both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression of and my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... a\nM visited by someone who's passed on and I might see an image of them in my mind but not like out in the in the open kind of thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent\nWhat they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual
