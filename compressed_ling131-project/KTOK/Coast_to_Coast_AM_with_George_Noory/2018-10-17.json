a a Mexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to\nTake the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually turning twenty century\nStash civil war maybe after the stash American War of the ... are they a lot of Mexican started to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nUh the government got his great idea to uh to uh\nTo prohibit marijuana along with alcohol nobody really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made a they created in the campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time called re from Madison talks about all the stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a marijuana tax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana and they said didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana is legal and it's been illegal ever said but the fact of the matter is is that\nPeople have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are ill with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least that a police state around are around people\nAre just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through a marijuana or secondary LAX or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol what we know that marijuana clause I'll tell\nYou this is the thing that uh you know and for me I guess it sets me apart from a lot of a talk show hosts are mostly on conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times and they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with the lot it every day to the the feeling of a\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you try something\nAnd I looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I says I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to and he said no give it a try and he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a can of is that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a museum kind of a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs to this country as such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world\nThey they treat or this type of a crisis\nNot with jail time and and punished but\nThey they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated\nAnd and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better or a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... there are needed medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments\nAnd I think that the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack or\nUh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were

stories short story sure but I'm getting the\nClosest to ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were in the valley as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary I'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but she just never could get away\nFor long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue port where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be reenter reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling [noise] ah so he did get coal credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you\nKnow what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was that gallery twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nOr documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were a thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of 'em yeah back then now nowadays with thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said if so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction and fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this\nPoint probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season\nA episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know religious youth and go back to a easier less stressful life was in the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its distance yeah so they both\nVery similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still note to this day they know that anything it's a cookbook you know they that's\nEver [laughter] and they're just so many good the what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started in that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nFor the next day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with

Serling were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be\nThrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restrooms renting obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today\nThere are so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think he would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but um but I think\nIn general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you I'm sure he he would hate reality TV on the um he and and I don't say\nThat just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television for its time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life uh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody onto the show in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will\nTrot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it's kind of reality television for the time and he just despise the show or you know I thought it was just the invasion of privacy and everything else so it's a reality show and he would hate but but I think there were so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWilling old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nAnd they were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm ... older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult to get\nThat kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about a major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know ... you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available though in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know have on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it\nNowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed that ... was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me it was as far as the visual impact was which was a testament to the you know some talk of her in the lighting directors which I just\nI was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay ... do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with Kurt that it that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you a brilliant you know spaceships or shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern um he would write a particular show that only took place in one one room because it was going to be cheaper to make\nYou know actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like ... of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kind of got the budget back under control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon\nTo be Robert Redford yay yay has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show and he was very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her a I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah it was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her\nHouse in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom [laughter] it's\nCalled the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the\nWhen the you know spin offs person you know a says a few things\nSo the who the war in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery\nOr because everybody thought she was ugly and she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else looked like in yeah that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was ... that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally released years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half\nHour oh really yeah okay yeah and\nThen you sure it was one of the hour long episodes and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nUh and so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pull the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA is yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation you know in Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah Hi\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very escapist\nWell then maybe someone stay back in the sexes I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really light that my second question would be a doubt the mysterious endings which\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and everybody ... already which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of ... he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would even bury things for you know for free for people or people at the college are more local businesses that I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod showing kept everything he ever ever ... every letter he ever wrote he kept in that they still exist than you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally a personal letters written the sign and everything [noise] um he\nTook that time to do that and it's really amazing that that you can't really find somebody saying a bad word

you know starting man he was he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of his experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes is hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber coming home from Italy crashes in the desert\nThe cap that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert Cummings Bob

outside and he was all down down and he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts and did it uh you know and pecans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story you know and the guy that ran a department store\nThey found ... even if it is a place like a John three sixteen mission

the cat and that was actually re made in the twilight zone feature film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again my point kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become

the market was going to work at a think\nTank yeah I got sick got called back to Connecticut and ended up\nIn the antique business chef restaurant jobs\nWork out when things usually working life\n... that's true but people love color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties\nI don't know where they are vast my mother who is eighty nine years old mom checked the end like where are they she says George ... we gave them away what I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card suppose that was in great good shape your real good shape right what would you ... well suppose you were at a tag sale\nAll right you're running around out there in the city angels and\nYou come across an old old house right hundred years old it's big coup all out there and there's a farmer just and I just sold the house I I'm just getting rid of the stuff so right away you got a feeling that this stuff might be a legit not at a tag sale where some facts you guys can outsmart\nRight right you look around and it's all real stuff that's been handed down for years yes see a fifty two man told their and excellent condition ask them a few questions you find out it's right a guy says listen I've been told that is where the porch and I want ten thousand bucks for it by the by it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like you\nWell that's worth a town somewhere in the neighborhood of a you know two hundred thousand dollars you know yeah oh\nI hear the L K lines and mental saying Willie Mays I had him all to\nMyself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally you had like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie guards slum\nI ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles or ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much uh probably would hurt the value you don't want to do that with us you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right everybody's on the baseball cards saying\nNobody's buying football cards which means you should be playing football ... interesting to write basketball cards\nI once saw a guy who had a complete [noise] he had Michael Jordan\nRookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called a big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on got\nOh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze basketball\nCard but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be by you get yourself like addict but his rookie cup Dick Butkus card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worth it\n[laughter] I did have a an honest Wagner card did you really just like a million dollars isn't it yeah it got two\nMillion if it has a a a a a Piedmont back\nGosh yeah that's that's the most famous uh collectible and history\nWhen what makes these collectibles so expensive and so long after\nI always say you know the way to make money in antiques just adjust instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old and\nLook at how dusty it is right that's not the kind of what makes things gives things value is what I called marketability ask yourself who's going to buy it\nYou know everybody loves baseball got its\nUnamerican the love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it sounds like Mickey Mouse\nYeah you're right\nBy its name the named beautiful [noise] um and he was ... right there is
