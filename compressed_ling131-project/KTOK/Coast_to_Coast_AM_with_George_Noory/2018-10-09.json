I Want to know who benefits from a hoax that this is a hoax\nIt just sounds like a typical guy on a radio making super addiction is all it is and so I don't know why this guy which is so hung up on the idea of the big thought it was a hoax but what I Want to do was on a plate you this broadcast the man who's been recorded off the radio could have made a lucky guess\nBut I'm a sucker for time

attempted to\nActually predict the future what would happen in the year twenty forty five here we go\nAnd get one welcome back in the program we'll talk about a rather serious topic to talk to your child today we're going to make some predictions maybe someday my back on such protections but yeah I Do know is Nineteen forty five hundred years from now\nIt'll be twenty forty five it is ever going to come out in the state of the world\nAnd one hundred yes we have seen before the world has changed drastically and the ... yes just one hundred years ago\nIn the Eighteen hawking fine the concept of

will get his news and entertainment from a variety\nOf sources big companies will no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy\nI predict that in one hundred years cost one no

are safe now remember these protections for us and maybe someday asking dramatic back on that day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting predictions if there are predictions that to come from Nineteen forty five and a some of them are accurate some are a little off ... by just a a tad I think but\nWhen you're dealing with something called revelation to the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas certain ... certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and would they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality and real time travel is these physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not there are things that\nShape the past future shaping the path time travel is a fantastic concept in most would consider the stuff of science fiction and yet we hear more and more that\nThe idea of dream through time he's he's he's quite possible actually a but to change the course of history yeah\nI don't know I mean we're we're told that there are different timelines that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter 'cause there'll be another time my little form after that that kinda thing I don't know\nBut um it is possible or hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more possible plausible but um\nThere are those who before us have had insight to see the future or they say they've come from the future to let us do\nYou know through science fiction that time travel is possible and his happen from time to time and time after time or or time in an item and and that's ... ... as you\nMay know like I said I Am in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called tomorrow and there was a Disney film with George Clooney in it\nAnd what I found most interesting is in the film or they discuss a secret society called plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history of the film I did some studying on this uh the story goes that good stuff Eiffel\n... Jules Verne and Thomas Edison at his power apartment to start a secret society of optimists plus ultra was founded it'd be Eighteen eighty nine world's fair in Paris, France\nThe organizations purpose is to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity al ... members of this group included\nPeople like H. G. wells Ray Bradbury Amelia Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other scientific figures well Disney eventually became a member as well so it started\nIn Eighteen eighty nine and there were people who became members of this plus ultra group and what plus ultra was was a group that\nCreated a breakaway civilization in another dimension okay so I Know science fiction right but is there any truth to it that's the question well as we do is we dig deeper into the story okay\nIt says now this is according to the movie fiction this this is the story tomorrow land in Nineteen fifty nine had an expansion of Disneyland it was actually about and this is what they said in the film\nThat tomorrow land was actually a training facility\nFor future societies future members of societies they were training them for a journey to an alternate universe\nAnd at this alternate universe was found and later developed\nBy plus ultra now the blueprints for the expansion he'll keep technologies that enabled the journey including something called a super transport key VIPs were encouraged to join plus ultra were given a special VIP audio chores tours of the world's fair\nOr the attraction is there there was Ford's magic sky way there was the it's a small world world ride and for those who couldn't attend the fair there was a there was a record player or record that they could play to get information about the details now Walt Disney had the it's a small world attraction at the Pepsi Cola pavilion in the Nineteen sixty four New York world's fair\nThat believed to contain approach tomorrow it\nIn reality\nDoes he does have a secret place\nAnd it's near the pirates of the Caribbean it's below the pirates of the Caribbean ride it's called club thirty three it's a private club a club thirty three is not acceptable to the public and it's for exclusive use of its members and is the only location at Disneyland\nThat serves alcohol had an editor clubs thirty three I guess has to press above the buzzer on an intercom it's concealed by hidden panel and the doorway\nAnd Walt Disney was a young boy he was a member of the demo they society and they sign a quarter and so a lot of people believe that the thirty three is related to the thirty third degree a Scottish right free masonry soap\nOfficials secret society that is a dimensional secret breakaway civilization called plus ultra I started wondering is there something like plus ultra that I can present for you tonight\nThat would be sort of a revealing that there may be some dimensional breakaway civilization or there may be\nSome ties to time travel yes\nI can do this and it it is ... ... as I was digging through this this ... plus ultra\nIt's Latin for further beyond now I Need for you to remember those words plus ultra because those are the two words that are going to be the ones that are going to unlock the doorway unlocked the key it's acute opens the door where the doors of perception of your mind to maybe have you thinking about where we are right now and whether or not\nThere are people in high places that can manipulate the future changing the passes or well said he controls the future controls

Trump\nWho was advised by a man named John ... some very interesting synchronous these in coincidences did make me wonder about plus ultra and whatnot plus ultra is a real group it's going to Robert in Ohio Hi Robert you're on ground zero\nHello how are you doing you love your show what you're talking about it's another as usual mind thinking situation that you always open the candle can't let the mind begin to think\nLast year I think you know I Love that you do that thank you so much and\nLet me get started by saying that a person who makes predictions and things like that\nYou know generally person should have a totally open mind on that because one never knows what's going to possibly happen in the future anyway right and there's a person has come up with the idea that possibly something good\nBecause you'll notice what protections a lot of times it says hey there's something good comes up or something bad happened I think one of the other\nAnd ah so you know people predicting things and people who are protected thing\nThat's Nineteen forty five show for instance that you're listening to uh put on there earlier was probably something that was played after World War two and England because the gentleman talking\nAs it sounds like he's anguish and he's trying to bring hope people make them realize someday there'll be no more face to worry about right yeah so that that's that's what that in my opinion is what that's all about as far as people make a production of this stuff sometimes they're good sometimes they're bad\nMouth all the the secret society now I totally believe that also too as you're saying\nThey alter plus a possibility I don't know I don't know myself personally if there is but with the way the world is today and the way society is today and the way the politicians are in the way everything is in this country is right up there is probably cigarettes are you\nDoing my mind is the you know here we have John Tromp who is a Donald Trump cynical who had all of Nikola Tesla's work you had all these papers and of course a Trump was\nA pretty much a a a big help and grieving X ray machines much of what tests for his work was about and Lauren Tesla created a depth re a bit ah most certainly\nYou know is speculative there but it's like well John Trump said well nothing was found that was a very important but yet John Trump went along it became a bit and then and then\nDonald Trump of course at mar a Lago he stays at mar a Lago and this is kind of hangs out his resort for all the dignitaries and all over the walls his he used the term plus ultra plus ultra plus ultra\nFrom beyond and it it you know just amazing the way that all comes together like that it makes you wonder about are also the ah the story about\nBaron Trump and the story about the last president it's just an amazing uh kinda coincidence that all this went down in the Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nWell one thing you'll you'll you'll ... easily find out what secrets societies mystified too is the fact that usually it's the people that have the money\nBut yeah that's right and it'd be a bit some sort of time travel secret society man that that\nExplains a

G. wells married\nAmy Catherine Robbins who died in Nineteen twenty seven minutes as as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel and women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six well wells\nAlso claimed that he was a Fabian socialist he was part of the open conspiracy to establish a future new world order out he knew that he wouldn't live to see the day that this new world order what happened but he knew that a new world order was in the works and he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order and the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war or\nA utopia that basically emanates from a global government there was a career Hispanic leader that led them and the whole nine yards well prior to that book\nWells wrote the shape of things to come which is another book that was kind of eerily prophetic because he talked about a World War started in Nineteen forty\nUh the world would be brought into a new world order by criminal dictator who ... the war machine and so that actually approximate and what really happened in World War two\nWell then he wrote and several of his books that\nThat there was a shadow government there was looming that this shadow government was there to create a new world order that would replace world religion and it would be an ugly thing and kind of like what Ben joined Israeli said about the British Government and well well you know he was a visionary we notice and\nWhether or not he was a time travel is anyone's guess I don't know if you ... ... but he according to this movie was part of the plus ultra program now Nikola Tesla\nIs also one of the guys that was in this program this plus ultra program allegedly in the in the Disney movie and of course his inventions went beyond electricity in fact there were some people who believe that he created a time machine\nThat he was be I guess the American equivalent of H.

this high technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age\nIf I were in Ilan mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain is ... machine in your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred than two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about it I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that\nAnd yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking synch with the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines\nWe know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure that introducing an element of like it may turn on us or\nThat there may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink when you got the co pilot right there you go\nIf you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and we come you know we're better now I think\nAt writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\nYou know he he's at the humane\nThe main thing that feels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that was very interesting reason which was\nAnd you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we didn't\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business you can make probably any department in your business and ten percent past ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those winters we now have the technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advances and I\nAh we probably had twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nA it's a fantastic question um\nArtist\nThere's no intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with the land mine just hypothetically that said um there was a camera and it can make sure that somebody wearing a ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder\nAnd you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess it's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence\nThat fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a promise killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before the shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally ah they only put that in because people requested it and so it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build\nA a weapon systems it's good to have it well\nFor for three very easy reasons you can argue the uh the the better the more effective at their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you going to argue that you will be saving lives are soldiers ...\nOr ... whatever country you are and and a third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing well\nIt may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and\nYou know which has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the commercial will finishes up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars do you see the day that the you know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with\nArtificial male people for example but think about that will be back\nTo find out

place to talk [noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back by Ron Reese with us survivor and do you think technology will ever replace postal people who deliver the mail to our houses\nYou know I I had a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it\nI mean 'cause the machine can do a job to make it you're going to do that job this word for that that's called the humanizing mhm 'cause if you just use the person for stand in\nFor a machine that you're saying nothing about you that makes us human I'll be interested in reality the machine that there'll be a ... a is delivering the mail a Erdogan packages or something like I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine washes windows I can imagine your machine that automatically\nMost my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nI Know that but if you take a step back these technologies\nCountry for two hundred and fifty years as ... as hot unimportant\nBetween five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of the job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years\nRight and we had rising wages\nAnd because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use is to increase my own productivity so what ever if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city\nIf you are I mean like\nIt it's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if you went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's going to sweat thing ... billion people are gonna use it what do you think it was going to do the jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't ... you wouldn't have seen at sea air being be super\nOr Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter when a lot I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming that you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we\nWe have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do and then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly\nHigh skilled we don't have Roebuck stick\nCan they can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so well\nThe correct correct but it's proved very difficult\nLike right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of moving there aren't going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an age and ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that oh you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative whether a computer can\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines are which is kind of all the things the brain guys that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons\nBut people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model that in the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people who have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we we are so spectacularly\nAmazing ah beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know of one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of ours but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages me already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough for the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man if was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize on I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave his prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened\nOr you invented the nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world a giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think\nThat um that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both of you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that's the only official intelligent you it is to be frightening\nIf if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and uh\nAnd we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it\nIt's like ... or anything to record a good teacher requires you to be president in any in any way\nBut for people who are the permission industry than it was just there was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that someday

I'm now ... you know within the organization thing in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you make this up\nHere that you're that nerd when you went [laughter] and you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on the journey and I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent\nAnd you know they they just they can't make their way over right are nine that's right and\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories ha I could to interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kinda thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell the story because they're afraid that they're going to sound like a crazy\nWhich is one reason I Would actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to tell they talk about their experiences as so many people have had him and I also wanted them\nTo you know I wanted to write it so people will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happening not yeah their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who has gone through the same thing they open up\nMy gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead\nBecause I you know when that started happening to me and I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand um a lot about what really anything about ... feet a little bit of that medium ship just get a little bit about but I started\nUm I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe in ghost so we're almost the majority\nWere barely a minority and that's grown up\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost\nNot all saying yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening\nUm but they can also now use some statistics to tell their friends hey either way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because of personal situation\nYes did did you know just\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you're not only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghost and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes well hold her guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started this aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs of ...\nDo you have been doing these cameras\nYou [laughter] and I found\nI use and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron on the phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know are unimportant and special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know\nWhen this was going on for the entire jury look we'll get into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you started to these strange thing\nYeah I um you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know how do kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides I human guys you know that that we're helping me understand it and and

and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of eased because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it\nAnd I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them

Adam and Eve away from God to really\nThem scratched out of the book of life and so clearly he's done a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience that when we sleep it's our physical body that needs\nSleep not our spirit the spirit goes off and parties and the actual face I'm sure many people have talked about the actual planes and\nYou know what our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen\nAgain it's just a theory which were pretty good\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have it are bad because you know what\nThe light does it need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark dark and he's like you know the the darkness one flight\nSo I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I Hope people will read the book I'm\nA at what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that have happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicate that experience yeah yeah I could handle it now you would really yeah I could put you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um\nOh let me just tell them I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat I'll do it if you want me to George is with like All right I'll tell them All right we have a couple of minutes yeah oh is it something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nI mean is when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I have I but I just tell everybody instead of is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called me and one night and said I saw that happening again\nAnd and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what he said\nHow hurt my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my ex step dad who was not very nice jeeze and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was like that that but I think it was that man who knows\nI Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonist and this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accepted didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge\nI completely understand that I Am also I've become fearless\nUse the photography all ... ... it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes photography and um and ah\nAnd storytelling it would be considered um the inciting event it's it's that event is what triggered all this other stuff to happen and photography with you know a little scary at first

doesn't bring me chaos it brings me peace um there's a lot more at work you know there's a lot more work like this story you know from the four oh five but I think is so I'm profound about that is\nAll the coordination collaboration that had to happen on the other side in order for me to still be alive\nYou know my spirit guide you know talking to me and and I had to listen and believe\nToo not just Pam my friend who I who I Believe it was actually her sister who was holding her down where she could not answer the phone or the other four people I called that you know their guys or their spirits are there fast somebody was distracting them not to pick up the phone\nAll with the you know chance that I Would hear in less than that is pretty incredible when you think about it from the flip side dramatic yeah\nIt is and as I I Believe that's happening every day all day all the time to millions and millions of people\nDoing that used to listen don't you think it's pretty stark if you did not believe in the other side that that's all there is\nYeah I think it makes the world really small and I think it and I think it also probably leads to a lot of depression and a lot of
