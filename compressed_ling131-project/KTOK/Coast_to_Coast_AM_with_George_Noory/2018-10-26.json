June ... good way out there but they had narrowed down the focus so he deliberately going on November first started and others so\nThe car and your calculation\nPredict that planet nine is core to a car elation that can only be seen by American I in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology planetary science department in Pasadena, California it struck me professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until\nThe winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November the date when you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ...\nWhat about him for rent infrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because we don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but\nIt's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see\nOnce we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might does have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or that it was inside of our solar system where Neptune and your interests are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have ... it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter lightly it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the or clout\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nIt it would have impact on every single thing in the\n...

they become much more ... in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now where computer models showing to do is have you worked on the id cc report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those the estimates\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger ...\nIn the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will\nOnly become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices than they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem a decade or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and how the news and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline certainly\nThere will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska\nDue to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by two level rise and forced to migrate as their\nCities become inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get ... billions of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low lectures\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war ... ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nLot of the crises\nSuggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a hit in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nTo global climate change and increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can't get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen\nMillion for at home may see sea level rise flooding over the next the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that\nUm the forty eight continental US state Florida now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking\nPersistent title flooding the researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue that in more than one million properties in Florida well have chronic flooding\nAnd that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat sea level rise which is already one of the big secret uh kept in Miami by the political institution there\nIs it they get flooding constantly on full moon constantly flooding on high tides they get constantly\nFlooding all over the time and everybody who live there now and that political governments and mirrors saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami nonsense\nThey've got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic\nHas melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida over the Next Fifty years and know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster\nIf Florida had water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that didn't mean that most of the southern tip of a four it will\nBe uninhabitable and that leads back to\nWhat drew ...

accountant singer outfit Robbie Williams and the oasis brothers\nThere's a little back\nAnd since then on most Wednesday evening's beginning at seven thirty PM mountain and another time zones around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of this computer to share news with\nThe general audience that is growing around the world for my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just a three weeks ago in October third I was doing updates on three categories the first had to do with the very distressing\nSubject of half cats beheaded cats\nAround the world bloodless\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car road kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Harlem an air force base of the ... down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update\nHad evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails and\nA lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth floor a Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\n[noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird uh I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these loop videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like act applies than I Do not know this is the extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard and he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida\nBut what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nUh talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida ...\nThis was in the spring of two thousand and age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down a very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what kind of was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed coverage of all my show and just lay there and look outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty great ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just raising the fascination of I didn't know what you're saying and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted Ira Glass passing by my human vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lists and the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is with fish living thing that was surrounding me\nAnd then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they're all being answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me envy\nCertain simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head ... possibly\nKnow there were no word there was no sound the hiring glitz almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head and I can see peripherally these hiring glass\nBut they had the same texture as the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they were just float by me but kind of mean\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a downloaded information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your\nSoul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because in my past experience with ever since I was a child I'd had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to as a very thin\nOn that it would cause in armies and tremendous amounts of flooding and I had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex\nAll seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this and so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information

I've been trying to share some of them more area white related uh the issue of what might come back\nThis dimensional existence a after a death of sort of an afterlife\nI Would like to share with you and our coast audience an example of one of the many emails that I have been getting tonight and this is an indication\nTo the quality and the heart felt and the profound emails that I have been receiving these various categories\nHaving to do with out of body or what the fog is and here I Want to read this came just a few minutes ago listening to on coast to coast while writing this my father\nWas very involved with World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office was his caregiver\nHe lived in this home for almost six years which I currently still on the news do not lived there while sorting out his items I was looking through the open door into the laundry area hallway adjacent back door\nI saw a very fast thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog go straight through the back door without it being opened up\nIt went through the door I did mention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends I Am an open minded conscious oriented person but\nImmediately feeling was my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected to see the gray color I wouldn't normally thought it would have been associated with something negative but he was a very positive person\nI have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house\nMay have been more like the gross more earthly matter in its purest form I had never heard the words smoky fog\nUntil you offered them one night and this is what it's been in my own office and I have wondered if it relates to a beloved cat that I lost a year ago and that that to the young ones the big furry ones that everybody loves chocolate and fluffy now\nI just keep wondering could it have been that cat that I Love so much a or I have a cousin\nWho passed the about four months ago she was Ninety six years old sharpest attack even a passing it was her body that gave out a she always said that she would try to show me that she had survive\nA my mom and dad have been gone for a long time but you never know because I really do think that this foggy smoke that you can find Google when you start Googling foggy smoke you will see amazing photographs\nOr that resemble what has been in my office and if it is something from another dimension trying to come and get my attention and the YouTube channel I Wonder why have you ever encountered this charge\nNo I haven't had something like that these are magnificent stories in emails I but I Do get a lot of emails from people up similar experiences yeah there's something very strange going on and you can't\nYou cannot rule alone the fact that it's real yeah you really don't yes and that\nProfound I'm going to be doing an entire series and may and one of my uh end of November coast I think it's going to be with at least two of the people who have had childhood uh separating body and that's\nThe question is it the very soul that leaves the body how could that be\nIf it is not a soul that needs to animate the container organic body what part is it\nThat is moving out from the body in out of body travel\nAnd there are all kinds of explanation in ancient Egypt Egypt about there being nine parts to the body and the so complex but we don't even acknowledge our soul in the western world and it probably is the most important part of us\nAnd when you go back to ... ages four or five and six and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say in their opening sentences I have never told a single human being in my life\nAnd I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four to six do remember an out of body because that is significant\nWhere was the learning there was nobody teaching this is something that must be spontaneous training of the soul and I knew body container\nWould you buy I sent you an email I think you got to make sure you follow up for this virus or you know children\nYeah the polio or something like the polio in November I Will so I probably it'll be related to out of body these incredibly profound\nTestimonies a and that there's a from this ban and there's a whole bunch more I can see that I'm getting tonight\nThey keep rolling in doping yes\nAnd people who have seen this on ... go to my earth files report look at\nThe looped videos that I have on the October ... through third or it may it's very clear I Dr ... third and then the second Luke video is October Seventeen look at them look at this strange extraordinary things twice\nThat it's come into the office\nI have not felt anything negative\nI Do think that people who have been saying that it falls more likely in the category of a loved one a lot down a little\nSomething coming back and then the issue is what would be the conditions in the latter world that we live in and all of our busy knows\nWhat would be the conditions that would provoke something that his pass into another dimension to do the energy or whatever is necessary to come back into the matter world even if they are appearing as foggy smoke\nWill go to ... planet X again in the ...
