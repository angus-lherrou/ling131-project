I began your favorite ... make a fifty dollar on my duty and frankly I Can't and you get a free makeup that\nTree out and then I think I never mind the you can help to breast cancer research handy and making an insect any sense skates middle saying ... everything stage I think the problem\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a\nLot of negative emotional energy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel about him and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homeless we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything\nBut we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit\nOr that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit\nFirst sometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean and freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody\nCalls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway this really\nIs not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates\nAnd spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home\nAnd then the family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it may be a professional but have it we're one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner and then first and then you can if we are all carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion not the only one\nThat are qualified exorcist and just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well like I called you know local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives um I keep contact with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nTo know do do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working with Christians which haunt me all the time even evangelical Christians have you know they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website stark clear dot com his book is called

we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOh a just a few years ago I did a free night and essentially at a legitimate haunted mansion very famous I won't mention the name but it's something I was\nAgain three years and years and years you all invitation I finally\nThey talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know and so\nUh it was actually set up for Gulf countries to go in and uh with are quitting in and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people didn't believe in goes had you know on a couple of ... their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in the most haunting room of oh they gave me it was actually the nicest really too but\nA first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get business cards people on it and I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but\nVery heavy oh she was called the golden rule and it went up to get my business card and then she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just would not stop I just said you know I just you know forget it I went to get my card and no attention I said you know\nThis place has really on it and third night I was there I was sleeping and uh I'd given\nEvery night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite me\nY'all follow people home negative spirit's just they will get\nTo know that gets you later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I would four feet above me was the miss shaping the spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to ... spears can assume any shape they won so I don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\n... what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's drain possible to describe it was not any kind of\nIt sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick ... and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a sneaky using and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just learn\nAn exorcist is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of people say so I I go completely beyond the client I did report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away and you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained because I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run negative spirit\nAnd so you know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller and email\nThanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped\nYou know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that\nI've helped or the last almost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do\nAnd I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with\nMy eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on a\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has an effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirit and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old very beautiful but I mean think of the moon energy just laid it\nAnd so people become uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know clearly session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's what makes them costs just for you know most\nAll energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to C.

spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems or depression anger issues unhappiness\nAh overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of the media does but actually\nBeen working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work I'm doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew it I could feel its power suddenly light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some medication for it\nIs it the demonic spirit had pulled muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nNegative what we might call hell and in essentially that is very connected to the physical realm maybe the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is\nIt possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know a good trip pan turtle I gotta go to the other side gets\nOff drugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen Ninety is asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see her still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job you don't have time spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that any more than a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is good that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's possess or anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment condo condo or Republican pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern not are dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nYour every are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them George\nI Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary 'cause when I reported that the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nMom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all those kinds of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and that fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives\nHelping people that to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people\nIs dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and once in a looser tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr ... in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nHe's doing Joan okay where are you are\nI'm engaged hanging um I had a um the thing and then I couldn't believe it I saw before I had a I had done a little ... ... and I had gotten\nTo read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if the devil real all this you know and I started reading the Bible and then I'm\nGoing back to the point when I was out of jail whenever and uh uh I asked God and I was like ... ... you know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to believe I so I it's probably\n... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened when\nI started seeing these little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them right and it seemed like everybody and when he had friends he everything he did he touch was known\nI mean you have a one like in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's one camp he didn't have none okay now these kids didn't get up and go oh it's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it up and told me that he was going to get an angel [laughter]\nBut he just didn't have one at the time\nAnd I'm leaving it was kind of me just to show me\nThat you know how it works warning or you know and then\nI bought a church in a ... a chemical about it and he told me you know you could go to church you find stuff no and I'm so we go to church but what was the church I won't eat them and I started the ... will will be angels like\nIn ... on the church all over the place all the way around it\nYou know it looks like there was a state of behind the ...

we're not taught to do it in in the schools were not taught to do it in churches were not taught to do it anywhere we\nWell how many do you think Jeffrey believe how many people believed that demons exists if you went out and pulled people\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is\nAll of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nTheir work on them for on people for a while you really these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative\nEmotional energies which are unseen but we feel about him and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and soda negative\nSpirits and so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them we wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whenever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all\nPeople call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clearing so I wasn't touching anybody any ways really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and\nThey're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistant just about every religion but the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get\nPeople call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I have deep contacts with\nHigher spirits are also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know if they need help to

weeks ago three weeks ago maybe we were talking off the air and\nYou do for addicted this very thing might happen\nOr that you were not real a cop out your your defense was play and you were thinking that sooner probably rather than later my students would end up losing his job and lo and behold look what has happened\nTape prompts where I can get them because I've been married for over Twenty years and when you're married for over Twenty years you don't get many props for just about anything you do so I Will I Will take them and said thank you that being said I hate to see my students go because one I like my soups\nAnd even though he's getting paid almost twenty five thousand dollars a month\nTo not coach speaking as somebody who has been through not exactly what he's been through but close to what he's been through when somebody pays you to not work\nIn your mind they are telling you that you are so bad at your job\nThey would rather pay you not to do it didn't actually get work out to be that can be a lot of damage to your ego when my students has been through it now twice what do you or at least once what do you and then with Arizona so he's been through this situation

credit for making a tough decision Lincoln Riley didn't really have a choice to make because one reports came out that there were altercations happening at half time in the cotton bowl in the locker room Curtis bolt and walking out\nYou get to a point where maybe as a head coach you can say you're going to be on the wrong side of history and Mike stoop certainly was by giving up forty eight
