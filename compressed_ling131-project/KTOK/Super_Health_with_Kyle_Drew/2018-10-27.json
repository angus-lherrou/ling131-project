{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "Around them but never really know her father took her out and talked about guns a little bit just give her the bury him [noise] but ah but never ... but you know she always wanted to go hunting and things like that but she never really push the subject in her father never\nPushed on her and uh so now yeah now she's one of the bird hunting with me she wants to learn about deer hunting\nUm she just died of an ad and really love the\nOne that's really interesting how did you first broach the subject\nWell you know I just just to normal conversation are brought up and I was a deer hunter man then next thing I Know we're just everything out or just you know she has an interest in camping as I Do and you don't usually people who can tend to be the same mind that assures as well\nYeah\nYeah yeah just just kind of you know everything outdoors you know just incompetent and um it just came up and she said you know I've always been interested in that and a cigarette and arranging she broke a couple turned looked at me smiled real big and I like it teach\nAnymore [laughter] so she's\nUm she's five three um six one some I got to do that are very well at all nope nope but um but I tell her like you know will ah or can do a different stock because I actually just remember like college about that credit off in the beating on and on I chose the BP\nSo I uh got it so now my old trapped gun I'm I'm probably going to be funny a shorter ... put on there for her\nAll right I'm going to make a suggestion to think about pets okay remember that just putting a short stock on it doesn't do it\nFor a number of reasons one is that\nThe barrels maybe longer maybe a little heavy a look at the percentage of weight of a gun I'd want to your guns versus your weight and then versus her weight imagine using that percentage on you so you might be carrying a twelve or sixteen pounds guy to pursue the same percentage of weight\nSo that's something to think about another is if she's shooting off the left shoulder\nTrying to get a gun suited to hurt it will make all the difference in the world for shotguns and then obviously you can get her out and do some pistol shootings why proceeding you're going to have a whole bunch of flying in front of you look I congratulations\nOn finding somebody who sounds like a real good for you Justin I'm excited for you\nAnd I wish you two are nothing but a lot of good shooting a lot of fun and that's a great life together I received a report that is great eight six six gun a year range force

Louisa upper Michigan halo ... is also\nA couple that I keep going back to one is the Naga and Chattanooga military park outside of the ah Chattanooga yeah they have\nThe clouds fuller gun collection there are part of it goes on calling all time's up into a Korean War\nBut the interesting things is of course they do they have a um a sharp they call it grand no shirts that had a male and the stock\nYou know I always heard as a and about stock I always heard it called the coughing all shirt so that they call a green shirt on their body in Greenville yeah yeah and I go to look at that right away and I forget [laughter]\nAnd then they have some oddities from earlier times and they also have a lot of civil war stuff including um worse breach loading are being\nMade by the state military

a modern I'm I'm One of her gun wow I'd never I didn't remember it and I went back there uh in June and\nA couple of and took a couple pictures are thinking about that is a lightning is very good center and you can get pictures and everything and there's very few that don't come out because\nHe can do to ...\nHow often we discovered this something we think it's been around for a certain period of time actually somebody did it many many years before you can go on just like it's hard to find something that's truly new\nIt's not it's not just on it it's okay you know the fact that works but it reminds me of a lever gun\nYou make them on the other\nThe other museum go ahead\n[noise] Minnesota it's\nAbove the silver age were changed gang younger brothers tried to take over the bank and take money on church then they stole the money was gone right on the phone and they shot him pretty extensively and killed some of them\nAlong the guy that got away I think eleven or Sunday random down enough\nDidn't the townspeople like shoot 'em up in the street\nThat's where the guy or the attending [noise]\nIt it kind of medical school and now he's back on vacation any carbon from the guy from the hotel on upstairs wouldn't know that a lot of damage it that other guy that shot their horses and\nAnd I mean it's very convenient to get out of town with the money they managed and then they got away with the younger brothers are all the\nWhile and I I've been there and I thought they had a gun that the guy from the hotel the doctor\nOn display free I manage to catch it last last year you're before this was a it was a single shot to me\nIt's ... and see I must try this and this is the hold here we go to these museums we find these interesting God's me come back it sticks with you that this is why we go to these highly I got to run but thank you so much that is very cool a couple of other of\nMuseums out there and they may not be necessarily firearms museums but their museums that have an aspect of firearms in my course that's frankly a significant portion of the history of not just the U.S broke the world can be toll part of it can be told\nThrough the development of fire toward the that's\nThe western expansion from the look of tequila slash Pennsylvania rifle through the blunder bus to military ... all the rest of it if you have a favorite museum or a place you bend you're going to say that's pretty cool I'd love to know about us our number is eight six six tall drunk also come back we'll be open lines looking for information are you buying\nAnything has evolved or you say for the upcoming funny see such huge guns tell us about well\nIn Nineteen forty one the U.S so it was born to honor and comfort to men and women of our armed forces around the world men and women who have put our dreams and our futures above their own to protect and defend the freedoms we hold so dear\n[noise] and burning and every one of their hearts as a singular undeniable desire\nTo return to the one thing to realize there to free\nAnd so the U.S are carrying on a ... touch their spirits comfort and to remind them just simply in Hartford we thank\nHim for the extraordinary gift and give us a call\nWherever and whenever they go to every browse and every hand this town\nUntil every song and some in every battle one until everyone comes home\nLooking at every single possibility that profession is looking at it from a purely surgical standpoint and there's nothing wrong with that so I don't want you to think this is a\nYou know I'm fighting the doctors thing I'm not\nI'm simply saying and Dr Frank you steer me into this uh you you tell me how you'd like to a justice but in my mind\nIf I get that diagnosis I at least want to come and visit with you Dr Frank first and at least see if there may be another possibility I also might feel as if\nGosh can I at least try this first before I go headlong into a full major surgery how am I doing talk I you you tell me\n[laughter] I Know that my approach now again man and a half\nThese allergies I Love the offer to where it's it's exciting at the right place to work but I just don't want to go there unless I really need to the left side of it is awesome like conservative opportunities\nAnd you know the interesting thing about that or is that most of my patients they say it was you know even though they have it on her insurance then she was less than ... anyway\nNo kidding so you know I'm a\nIt is it is the type of situation that we need to be mindful and if we have something surgical that's what we ought to do so many of these things are ... you know if you're not leading out if you're not if your if your\nHeart is not a losing function in front of your corner vessels you know if you're if you don't have abscess on your ... there's a lot of things that they require a surgery or or\nFairly soon yeah but those things really that's why you know that's why they're scheduled their elected if they weren't elected than they'd be rushing you ended up pretty\nWell in in ... by the way you listen to a super help that soccer Brian Frank I'm ... this scene that I always think about it I'm reminded of when I jacked up my knee\nAnd it was swollen it and I don't even know what happened it was just bad and so I contacted few people I Know a few people I trust and they said yeah yeah you're going to have to go ahead and get surgery for that\nAnd I was really bummed out I called Doug Hoffman my buddy Doug and\nSimply said this he said you know this stuff to do for the joints if it doesn't give it a couple of months if it doesn't get better I'm sure they'll still be able to do the surgery two months from now\n[laughter] I just thought that was freeing\nAnd sometimes you need a a friendly hand to come in and the thing about it is is that I'm just simply saying why not begin with the relatively inexpensive prologue therapy with Dr Frank or at least go in for a console Dodd Frank might steer you against it after ... examines\nYou there could be a situation where he says you know what actually I Do think that ...\nSaying we're going to have to reduce the dos or maybe unlimited altogether and you're scared\nAnd maybe some people I guarantee you have thought about okay how do I find the illicit version of this out on the street\nThis is a story that happens over and over again this is not the drug dealing culture of a different era that we're talking about in most cases the these are people who came by this addiction understandably and they need help\nOr maybe you should find a way and ... and you might want to talk to your doctor about this or go to one of the doctors who we talk about on the show Josh Dr Bryan Frank for example Dr ... Santana uh for example\nDr Paul Roswell yeah keep fish about it for us if people are having an opiate situation he can tell them stories of his own related to amusing ultra occur really individuals with it do those were some stories I heard\nAnd there are other supplements to help balance the brain with people that are on chronic opioids you're the endorphin balance in the brain is completely shot\nWe we need to have somebody on at some point and just talk about this whole issue\nTalked about it from an ultra career perspective and all of the things to transition a to a to a new life because people's lives have been turned upside down where can they go we just mentioned a few but where can they go Josh to to either get a sample or maybe they're just ready to buy a bottle for themselves\nYeah and the samples or a three day trial or to capsules twice a day and that really is typically what's going to work for someone to so to speak kick the tires and see if for ... for them or Dr Bryan Frank there in uh north admittedly genesis health\nYou have Dave Mason it innovative pharmacy and Edmund Halley a Hartman over it Haley's herbs in Edmond and then you've got\nDr Laura miles or come forward encompass wellness\nYou've got Keith bishop over flourish pharmacy you've got our lovely omega people editor Meg health on twenty third street got Dr Paul Roswell you've got Lou Philips overt Meridian nutrition\nYou have a ...
