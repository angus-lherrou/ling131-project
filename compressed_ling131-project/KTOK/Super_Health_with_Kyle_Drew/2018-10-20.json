R. P. ... rich plasma too common therapies both very effective\nIs there ever a time when you would say to a patient you know in your particular case I think ... is the better choice I mean is there I I just don't know because they're so comparable I'm Wondering if there's ever a difference\n[noise] well um if the patient really wants to spend three or four times the money that way and given that option but we let them know that you know historically and we're talking for many decades the success rate is is comparable between those two choices um it it always surprises me we hear about\nProfessional athletes that they'll fly to Boston or fly out of San Francisco or somewhere like that you get the new stem cell therapy and they spend literally thousands upon thousands of dollars when for a few hundred or a show that they could get their treatments down right here in Oklahoma City metro area um\nYeah you know so I ... it's the choice you and they're and they're making those choices given the information they have\nAnd that is true and that's the thing stem cells are hot right now and you see the stem cell clinics are opening up everywhere and there's also this weird thing that happens with people where if it's more expensive\nIn their minds that equals better right I mean sometimes that is how people judge these things and of course when they go to these high level expensive clinics and it's a tens of thousands of dollars and they have millions or in the bank\nThey're thinking that they're well you know my doctor tells me that this particular therapy well of course your doctor does that's what that's what he does and that's where he makes his money\nYou have options Dr Frank and it's nice that you care about the rest of us\nWho are maybe don't have the infinite resources but we are in infinite pain right now and so if you're dealing with bone on bone degenerative disc St rotator cuff your pain it's miserable\nAnd you're probably already taking the ultra curb but this is something that's actually anatomical where you have to regenerate to issue\nThis is this uh this is the type of therapy that we're talking about and there is a way to actually regenerate tissue with only about three minutes left\nLet's say that I'm bone on bone is there a time frame I Know everybody's different doc so I I I'm not holding you to it but a general timeframe before people go whoa I'm feeling better now\nYeah great question what what we would typically say ... and really the same would hold true whether its knees or back her\nShoulder or maybe tennis elbow or or ankle problems whatever is to test it we know that as we go through a series of for treatments typically those are a couple of weeks apart maybe two to four weeks apart\nUm by the time we do for treatments about eighty to eighty five percent of people have made significant recovery and in fact mine already done it for three or four treatments are probably say\nAverage number treatments was probably five or six or but you're looking at over a period of weeks regenerating healthy structure and and you know healthy joints know her\n[laughter] well and this is the thing I'm In my own case I've I've I've threatened you that I'm coming and I'm going to get this done and for me [laughter] for me\nI jacked up my knees you know years ago in various times it I I kept three injuring them it's not bone on bone\nTo me that's great because I don't want to wait till it is bone on bone and it takes longer and it's more painful and you know all the stuff\nTo me in my particular case where I'm having pain every now and then and uh sometimes it's persistent pain and uh I Do want to have\nA regenerative approach I take ultra Kerr you uh work with the guys that do for her so I Know that you give that yourself but sometimes you just have to regenerate the tissue altogether or for the whole on approach\nAnd for somebody like me who look it's not radically bad\nTo me that's a great time to do it before it does get radically bad on the other hand if you've waited waited waited and\nYour doctor Castillo Santana at work that medical your\nShirt over for harmless like
