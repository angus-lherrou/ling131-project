I was about say USC that dad got him in a cage again mixed martial arts\nMidlife crisis of a no no and enormous proportionally early to tell you [laughter] this guy was a a ... was a wrestler in high school absolutely and uh I was not even though I pretended like I was and I was just a so I kind of went out for it but uh I I was the guy that\nYou showed how to do different moves on you know here's how to do a statue of liberty Kyle come wrestle me as hard as you can and then you put me in it and ten seconds every team needs that guy\nI Know I write the crash tests are absolute and so ah but this uh but but Rob was a real life wrestler and then I didn't realize that he was the real deal until later on\nAnd so here coming up close to forty seven years old you stepped in the cage man um what was that like and what prompted you to do that man\nI tell you the biggest a determining factor in that was I could feel myself slowing down\nAnd I think all of us down and go through that and I decided to super charge something in my life and I decided to take on another challenge you know I'd been competitive really all through my twenties and thirties right and really decided to hang it up and went like Randy to tour in\nSome of their eyes coming out and doing it yes you know they inspired me and I thought we can do this a reason for a comeback absolutely willing to her\nAnd and enjoy your normal life even when you were not competing you were still kind of training though 'cause I mean you've got a a a a team of wrestlers called your family\nWhen you have a big villain nuns Josh and most of them are out of them have have wrestled all of whom have they are all competitive and I think just self preservation more than anything when you have six sons wrestling you are the practice them that's all right that's right and so I always try to stay in good shape\nYour brother's doing it with you now are you do it at your own in your own property or do we have a gym there at my place and then we have a mutual friend Dusten and I know that he has trained and his family is trained for a long time in in martial arts\nThey have not and not so much wrestling but he ... justice being asked to absolute okay so the real deal the point\nIs is that at close to forty seven you decided to go in and either get mould ah or survive or maybe possibly possibly win I don't see any scar tissue on the one\nI don't know that winning and losing really had anything to do with it I didn't get on my mind go there really I didn't it was the experience and I think so often in my past I had just rushed past the experience to get to the ... and I didn't I did win or lose is that something I Want to do\nI Know what that feels like though sometimes whenever the the outcome is too big in your mind you you you can't perform\nI really want to rush or I did not consider victory necessarily uh when I the fact that I was doing it and walking in the cage at that age I considered\nSo let's talk about that age what was training like and and and it applies to today 'cause you're still training you you're not competing every week but you're training absolutely so what changes in your forties compared to when you were sixteen years old could eat anything that you want\nA still make weight and feel great the next day what is there a difference\nA huge difference I think a couple that they were bigger than I thought were Henry was huge ah yeah\nYeah when you're young you can go to bed and you wake up recovered right I I Would have to take days off training I had a short training camp in my body physically could not keep up with the demands of it so rest was a big part of that\nHard to do whenever I think every maybe everybody's I can only speak from it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Super Health with Kyle Drew", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "06"}
