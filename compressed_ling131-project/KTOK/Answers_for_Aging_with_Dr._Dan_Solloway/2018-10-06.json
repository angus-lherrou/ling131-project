you think bring value to home to make it move faster\nI think the first thing that comes to mind is Kirby K. that are\nLike fresh paint cut the grass\nRight\nOr you know like my house for example if\nWe just had it not even six months ago and the outside yeah we actually know this this whole selling the house thing it was all of a sudden it wasn't like we plan this\nOkay that's the way it out and\nSo anyway curb appeal um\nIt's funny how when you live in a house you grow your house I don't know right at least we did\nEvery house I've ever lived in it she was like we outgrow it we end up getting so much of the house looks cluttered right now I got half of my house sitting in a storage unit so it's you know it's I'm Still living in it but it's more staged\n... yes I was gonna say staging so uh so far you're talking a lot about parents and your right aesthetics you're now you're talking about initially ... aesthetics outside like to paint\nRas the driveway and now you're talking about aesthetics inside so when they come in it's what they call staged where you have furniture or strategically placed in there to kind of show what the home could be like if they live there right\nRight I Love it that's good stuff or does she get\nJust\nJust you know there's there's funny is funny every house that we lived in ... right as we get house ready to sell yeah I think he goes why do this while we lived there\nI was going to ask you that actually can I hear a lot of you are a lot of people say that it's like they fix the house up to sell and usually when they do that what they do is they knock out a bunch of projects they'd been talking about doing a Iran they get them all done and then they're like what the heck are we doing now we've made it the way we like it\nExactly [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nThat's hilarious [noise] ah\nSo I was going to come at this from like a more of a mechanical perspective I Am the first thing I'd like to say is that I think that your tank was hot water heater is a big seller\nEven though realtors will tell you that it doesn't translate into the price I Believe it does influence a ... a a couple's decision if they're looking at a house that has every amenity to your house at same square footage\nComparable neighborhood schools down all the things that people think about I think that something like ... hot water heater could be a deal breaker or because\nYou look at it the benefits that come they come from having it the cost of trying to retro into one if you don't have one it's a big selling point\nSo I think that the tank list is going to really help your house move quickly\nUm what do you think about a maintenance programs\n\nWhere do you what do you mean by maintenance\nFor her you know I'm not a big fan of home warranties um we do we do a in our company in Tulsa you know we do HVAC down there we have what's called the platinum program and it's basically an all inclusive HVAC program for forty five bucks a month\nUm you know but now there's\nThere's nothing like that here in okay see but\nUh there are a lot of home warranties and things like that where you could prepay so much for the year and it basically says you know your dishwasher breaks down will replace that if your disposal breaks down will replace it or fix that your refrigerator you cover all sorts of stuff\nOr and Julie pretty inexpensive what do you think about ah with the those type of things\nI think any preventative maintenance is a is a great I mean does it say it was really\nYes uh I agree and and you know it also puts the purchaser at home it's sort of squash is what we spent the first three uh segments of the show talking about which is inspecting everything\nTo ensure that its life expectancy was going to be halfway decent and that it's operation is good\nBut it's a homeowner hits here that selling to you and they say hey by the way here's this little list what I like to call my gold star list\nThese are things about my home that I think that you're not even if you're looking at comparable homes of size and amenities these are some things that you're going to find that come with this home that you're not going to find in the rest\nAre mine has a thankless hot water heater\nA mine has this warranty program that guarantees all of your appliances if they break down in the next three years they get repaired or replaced um you know for free or with this fifty dollar to duck double or whatever it is\nI'm I've even I've got some friends that flip properties and what they like to do is um\nThey literally will a rip the carpet out\nUm and then when you go in they've got little swaths of carpet laying in there that they've already gone to a a carpet store\nA installer and they've gotten the swat so that that gets the carpet that they already know what the price is going to beat installing it it doesn't really matter what color you pick and and they had the swap laying out on the fireplace or the or the kitchen bar so the bottom the home can pick the carpet and you'll install it\nAnd it's it's you know twelve hundred bucks which is nothing in the scope of things\nAnd again it it just makes the selling of your home something that they're not going to find and all the other ones that they're looking at so I Would say that goes on your gold star list\nI've seen some people would even go as far as to do that with tile um pick the carpet pick the towel we'll put it in um of course you know I'm not trying to go extreme or anything I'm just saying these are inexpensive ad on that you can throw in there\nThat in the scope of things really cost you very little\nUh and it might mean the difference between your house selling in a week or selling in months\n\n[laughter] what's going on now you are you are you thinking I don't I'm\nI'm Still I'm thinking you know apparently my game are still in the house is not going to be very good I I'm not offering that program\n[laughter] well you know I'm not saying that many people are uh [laughter] I'm just a no you are I I'm just you know I to me\nI Will say I'll tell you this a nice fund bragging point for me and and then we got to close out I guess or is missing I sold our house in three days [noise] um I mean we listed it on a friday and and uh by Monday was gone\nAnd uh it moved that fast and\nIt was we had our little gold star list on there and I I Believe one hundred percent it's that's the reason that it moved so quick it was just it was a no brainer deal and they weren't going to find anything else like it out there and they jumped on it first first family looked at it bought it may just went that quick [noise] just saying\n[laughter] I'm hoping that I got my first fired or whether they're one thirty\nGo get them baby hey you need to you need to get off the phone with me and you need to be there was some coffee in snicker doodle cookie command [laughter] uh and if need be take your shirt off\n[laughter] oh no we're not trying to scare more [laughter]\nNo I was thinking you could tell them if they don't buy the house you're going to follow him around [laughter]\nOh\nI Love given my brother James a hard time folks ah you know he's BP over their central Oklahoma when Nelson\nEr which by the way it is a place that we go for all of our supplies are there ... there are people there are so helpful so kind and courteous customer services over the top uh James himself ... they're all ready to help ready to solve the problem\nWith patients and humility right\nOr if if folks want to get a hold of you guys or maybe you want to visit with James I know he's got a I've I've told them forever he's got a face for radio you folks got to go meet him shake his hand and say Hi to

short time I go with senator is make the case for and against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hours before and expected confirmation vote\nSomething terrible is about to happen and like you said it's been a long strange history the first one that they developed within the early fifties and at the time they called it ... which was a mixture of the words\nControl of electromagnetic radiation and what this would do with upon activation\nThis warning system all the radio stations across the country with either shut down or switch formats over to broadcasting from the same two channels and it would be a recorded message from a guy who was a TV personality at the time and best friends with President Eisenhower Arthur Godfrey and he was a trusted voice he wouldn't record this public\nService announcement and there are no copies of his audio by the way I Love that very mysterious into it and basically just warning everybody to stay calm and that Americans will survive whatever the nuclear war is going to happen right\nKind of like what happens now with the emergency alert system just a voice comes on and says hey it's an emergency become et cetera et cetera but this one was just funny because it was tied to TV personality oh Arthur Godfrey yeah so that was early on in the fifties and then another system that they had which I kind of thought was totally ineffective and I guess that's why they cancel it\nWas they were setting up a system of mothers and pink balloons what was that\nThey did it in a really small concentration 'cause this was just a test so this was never anything that was major Lee rolled out but in a small town of Charlotte, Michigan which happens to be near a civil defense agency headquarters at the time\nThey set up with five hundred warning generators and with us they distributed to just over like a thousand devices to everybody in the town and they were to plug this in to one of their electrical outlets and then when they did the tests are the system basically all the outlets started buzzing yeah and\nYou were to go I guess your back yard and release a pink balloon\nAnd that pink balloons are supposed to signify that something terrible had happened\nI mean that's a totally crazy you can't trust people to be reliable enough to do that but it was supposed to alert Ninety percent of the country within thirty seconds that something crazy what's going on but there is no message attached\nTo it it's just being balloons that means mass hysteria would break out so they cancel that program 'cause it was going to be totally ineffective and then around the time of mixing there was a new system that they're trying to get set up\nRichard Nixon and LBJ wanted to develop their own version of it which they called the decision information distribution system than ... device and what this was it's it's something that you can plug into your TV like think about a fire stick in the seventies\nBasically the same concept and so you plug into your TV and what it would do was change the channel if you had some kind of warning set from Washington they would get on all the TVs and ... automatically change the channel to everybody'd be watching the same program informing of what's going on it\nBut at the same exact time that this was happening and this is what's leading as to what happened yesterday the public lost all trust what the government because of what happened with Watergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their ...\nAs you said people were kind of mad they don't want the president to be able to bust your phone\nWhenever he wants to just to clarify if not the president sitting in his office and saying I'm gonna send out this alert no ... there's a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that so you know there's this long history\nLeave us a comment give us a rating and tell us a story that you're

we're running down some of the top stories of the week I don't have to check out the daily died Monday through friday or more news without the noise [laughter] Nobel\nPrizes were also being awarded this past week\nOne of the more interesting a Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in medicine physiology or medicine and went to two people Dr James Alison and test Sudoku hung Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs him you know therapy quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking who were these Nobel Prize winners James Alison ...\nBoth of them that specialize in immunology studying the body's\nImmune system this turned out to be a critical part of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective and are active in certain situations but\nBut it can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells in the body along with cancer cells will so that causes that causes all sorts of complications going\nBack about Fifteen Twenty years there was another ... Vance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutations in cancer cells now this immune based approaches sort of the newest wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating catcher in the long time\nThese two scientists working separately but it in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that if used certain kinds of drugs to target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how\nLot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells as T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nThat mean what's so interesting about what they discovered was that the body's immune system as sort of its own natural check points or break so that\nIt doesn't go overboard and attack that healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figure it out how to exploited and so they in some way they sort of latch on to the break about his immune system in a way that helps him escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both scientists essentially take breaks off the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he is key true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think that a lot of people have become aware of them through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter picking the true to an yes with TV commercials now are promoting\nThe use of the vote and keep true to I think primarily lung cancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drugs has shown some promise\nThe research still obviously continues they're finding out that these things help treat those things but you know it's not a hundred percent success rate so the next step is to find out why it works the way it does work and then who would benefit most from it\nThere's also a costing somebody's immune therapies can cost upwards of a hundred grand per person so that has to be figured out as well but doctor\nI'm Joe himself as even said this is a work in progress but he you know confident in his own work in progress of these treatments says by the end of the century cures could be found or you know just even more therapies can be developed to help out with this stuff\nThis studies have shown that as welcoming as these drugs are and as much as they represent and in that struggle alone I think for the most part only works in the minority of\nPatients that we see that in the study what's striking to doctors about these drugs is that in that minority patients that can have a lasting effect that can help people live in some cases for years to the trick now\nIs to try to better predict in which patients these drug will work and", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
