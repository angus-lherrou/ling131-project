replaced or gas line replaced um there's actually a trench list processes now by which we can put these in a there's a couple that I wanted to talk about today that were capable of doing we we have the machinery and the skill sets do\nOr the first one I Want to call a pipe bursting ... or ... is pretty interesting process uh and it basically is what it sounds like\nA say you have an old dilapidated sewer line or or water line and it goes under a parking lot or under concrete or sidewalks and you're thinking to yourself or maybe it's a beautiful yard you just don't want it tore up\nOr we can find that line we can even go up a size and the line and the way this works is we fish a line through the existing went to\nA ... to some you know point of starting um so we dig a hole out there in the in the starting place and then we have it opened up at the building and we hook our line in our head on to the new line okay so here you have a picture and arrowhead\nWith a with a with a cable hook to the nose of it to the point and it's going through the old line or the new line is hooked to the back side of the arrowhead and then we literally use like a winch type\nA mechanism that some braced at the other end of the line and it polls this arrowhead through the old line and as it does it ... the old pipe and polls the new line through the opening that's created while a pretty cool that is it's pretty cool [noise]\nUh so it it solves major problems uh we did one a project for a mall where we were going across the significant amount of parking lot and you are and they loved it because we got to cut kind of what we call pothole you know we've got to pothole in spots\nAn open up and down the line up and cut it and then fish the line through and\n[noise] and we got to get it done now without destroying this big big parking lot and tripling the cost of the job a ... has one but now honestly residential aid that's not something that you're going to\nTo see a very often um what's your going to see more of is what we call boring a and it works similar and the fact that we have a\nPoint of beginning in a destination point so we have to pothole again no getting away from that uh but what we can do and and it's amazingly precise\nWe actually have a ... that tells us where the head of are boring rate is so ah tells us where it is tells us how deep it is like GPS yeah it's it's like a it's like an electronic low cater a uh and so we're out there with our one and we're located in the head on this boring ...\nSo what we can do let's say if you guys are having to replace the gas line or replace a water line or or even a sewer line ... uh and we come in\nOr were able to pothole\nAre out there by the water meter for instance let's just say a water line and say we're trying to bring it to a destination a lot of times in some circumstances that the new the water line the old water line terminate in the middle of the slap in the middle of\nThe house or or maybe in the garage or something like that we're able to pothole where we're trying to go and then with the boring rag in conjunction with our low cater a and we can bring it right to that spot wow a and then\nPull and then we bring as we pull our boring a ride back out we pull the new line in a row so it's kind of interesting 'cause pipe bursting\n[noise] both of them are fishing something through to pull the all the new line in right like a dead or cable or something yeah it is ... bursting is\nI'm going from the point of the beginning of the service like the water meters aghast me or what have you and then I'm pulling the new line in boring I'm boring to the spot where it's going to end or terminate at your home and then I'm pulling the line out there ah\nIt's really interesting and in something that I Would like to point out\nSay you have a ... a lot of folks sometimes will say well why can't we ... this you know uh because maybe we've cameras the sewer line or are inspected it and\nMaybe it has a belly in it which we come across a lot which usually as a result of either um could be shifting in the soil could be a ... intrusion you know heavy rut growing across the top of the line and actually has pushed it down more times than not though it's a result of improper installation and they did not\nBack bed the pipe up properly vetted in once they put it in the trench and then when they back filled on top of it and they threw you know three feet of dirt on top of this PBC line\nIt if it didn't have anything underneath it to support it it pushes that line down slightly over time uh and you end up with what we call a belly\nPiper sing won't work because if you think about it for a second that arrowhead that I'm pulling through there and I'm just calling it that first the so you get a picture in your mind\nYeah it's going to follow the old pi and burst the old pipes so that means that my new line this can have the same belly in it than the old line at a and so\nIn those circumstances\nUh we either have to bore or we have to dig the trench and put that new line in\nA so you know it's just it's some technology that's available out there that you don't think about and if you don't deal with this every day you might not even be aware that this sort of process is even available\nBut maybe you've been tolerating something\nThat you don't have to because you've been thinking to yourself\nThere you have to tear up my driveway they're going to have to tear up this parking lot or we have to go\nUh we had this little street or whatever the case may be there is technology that we can use there's ways to get it done other than just going out there and digging this big hole or\nSo the best process to take at that moment is to get us out there let us take a look at it and then we'll tell you if we can or can't do it but ah have either want y'all ever had to replace any of those types of service lines\nMan oh no no [laughter] I just ... trying to knock it I don't think this was would I don't think the ... right right and I probably as was underneath the firm I I'm kind of question man's yeah\nGoing back to the or whether it's a ... or whatever um what kind of do you have options on the type of ... that you're putting back in\nYeah you know we have to pull up a poly ... lines in there and it's got to be fixed and and it's because we don't want a bunch of joints or and so we're wanting to pull something that is flexible and that we can kind of gets pulled up and gone there and then as it pulls through it at an all the lion and pulls it into the ground\nIt's it's a cool process will watch ... advance to those types of just watch the oh did you do that's what it is oh they're all over they're Googling it can it out it was pretty good to look like and arrowhead yeah it does it literally I'm given a very uh\nI think a good comparison of what it would it would look like and just much bigger yeah a ... you know a much bigger than a\nRegular arrowhead but basically in simple terms of and it literally split set other pop open pulled the new pipe inside it it's a heck of a deal but it's got to be a it can't be fixing a belly because that won't work and the other thing the other problem it can run into\nIs if there's an obstruction that we can't get cleared then we can't get the cable through to pull the head back through but again that sort of boring kind of comes into play because it bypassed us all of that of that yeah ah and then boring we just have a starting point and finished point and we just keep going\nAnd and so we get there yeah so it works really great pretty incredible\nUh guys this show\nWent quick hook up with a very ... yeah I think today was useful or so maybe before we take off and sign off for the day or let's give our contact information one more time or how to folks get a hold of you guys that mother nature's pass them on\nThe coast of the four oh five to seven eight eight one zero zero

we've neglected to mention it on the show go check it out in the next couple of weeks high of a it's\nJust about ready [noise] All right and that's going to be nice secret to come with Mother Nature

journalists democracy ... was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey during a fist fight the kingdom has a ... Eighteen people\nYou never we appeared and that's all kinds of with a bad job of increasing repression in Saudi Arabia especially against anyone who speak\nOut against the changes or any of the ships that the crown prince Mohammed bin Oman has been pursuing my kind of strange because he's also been discount contested and putting them reforms that are very much being cheered by the west that he had tried to cultivate this reputation as a progressive as a reformer in this\nDeeply conservative Muslim country but he's than\nCoupling that with this very authoritarian harsh crackdown on dissent and this was one of the reasons that John Hall I show she had gone very disillusioned with the conference and was writing columns that you have and so the steam here has\nUpset the government and of course the latest reports are a bit different about where things are going to or we'll get to that and\n... as you were saying how show gee in his early writings was a very supportive almost a go between between a lot of journalists and then when the crown prince came a little more into power and obviously would be\nNext in line he changed his tone so obviously the you know the crown prince did not like any of that and they're saying that for something a hit or something like that to have been taken out against him it would have had to been ordered by the crown prince himself that's what leads to all of this international intrigue now and\nWhat happened and why was the order to be killed or captured or abducted or something\nOne of the updates now is that they're saying that Saudi officials are preparing some type of report to acknowledge that ... his death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong\nThere still saying that things can change in this report is not solid yet but that's kind of what we're hearing now\nRight so this is the CNN reports and what's really striking about it if it's this comes out to be the case if they do report that indeed\nI show she died while in Saudi custody first of all you know let's not forget the Saudis originally said that he was fine and he left so it shows that apparently they lied from the beginning and if they now say well we only meant and parody him we didn't lead to kill him it was an accident\nI I guess that's not out of the realm of possibility it's something that President Trump I'm listening to indicate that it's a story that she would accept and it's not impossible I mean because because the studies that they do have a history is perhaps China\nHoax people to come back to the king more rendition them or not they don't really have a history of killing people\nIf he dies because of harsh interrogation techniques let's just say that's something pretty serious it's not like they\nWill incredibly they're just trying to question this takes that step further and where's the body one of these people that apparently went in had a bone saw that's why they think that he was dismembered and the president has made that\nSaudi Arabia one of our allies in that area the reports are that Jared Kushner is very close friends with the crown prince also and you know they're trying to open up the area to business and things like that so I don't know if that would put a halt to it but it would really severely impact what's going on there\nAnd this is what's extraordinary them I'm I'm being told oh that like inside idea right if people are a bit frustrated with it because they're saying the Saudis have stayed with the United states through so many different things we cooperate with them on every level why should this one\nGuy is one incident got all that and there's no indication in the ... by any means and the relationship what I mean that's not even I don't know\nA million subscribers now at ... at\nNetflix came on the scene and they were doing a lot of movies and have now transitioned into all sorts of original programming TV shows and movies you're going to have choices all over the place and it's going to be tearing you away from the traditional TV cable bundle\nNo the other thing for an end or at that for really long time there was a reluctant for TV network at all in there and then say well I think they should be that far and wide\nNet Panasonic as they figure well we didn't need them I\nGuess I mean that was oh well I think that there are ... that all of that now what is your favorite fat cells I no longer right as a reason for that they want to make sure that the way that they can undermine their competition like keeping their intellectual property heating their parents that that\nIf you want to know where you can only go to that and you know while a lot of people think content like game of Thrones and Breaking Bad it's like wearing your family and get that little can you really want that kind of had no I wouldn't be surprised if the\nFamily and that and by that\nIs really interesting and but there will be no shortage of things to watch now so it's going to be crazy

I'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week and don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nI think one of the stories as captured everybody's attention this week is that of the lottery the mega millions jackpot is the largest that it's ever been Powerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also\nI think between the both of them they're going to be given away one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery Miranda if you won the lottery who would be the first person you'd call\nAnd I think I call my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been in Samy mouthy forever and so she's the only person I Know who would not try to get money out and yeah and she would know that people to call the ... generation\nThat's funny I bet you're going to say something like hey I'm as rich as you guys but [laughter]\nI I mean I might say that the experts say that the first person you should be calling is actually a lawyer because there's a lot of stuff\nThat you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lot of times in states your name has to be publicly announced you can't get away I think there's only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know good luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning or one in three hundred and two point six million or ... for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million so and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight quandary really and then I ... followed by Fifteen zeroes so and I miss the odds are crazy we spoke to Rodrigo told her ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer for us and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call a lawyer towards winning a big I spoke to a uh chasing colonel and he's an attorney based in New York He's actually the self proclaimed lottery lawyer he's represented more than thirty lottery winners ... eleven\nI saw him at his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy\nI guess you'd say the expert on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much the first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners and basically protecting them from a lot of the pitfalls of winning so much money and such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first and the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option it's five hundred and forty eight million dollars is still a ton of money\nOne of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it was like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jackpot for the mega millions was also\nPretty large so people the the question that I Will get most frequently is can I claim my jackpot anonymously if I win\nSo I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to and encouraged us to file what's called the public record request and through that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nBe a director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game\nSo we want people's names out there you know this is\nWe want people to know who's getting the money that they've spent on this state wide damn this lottery and you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a allow the er an entity to claim the prize rent James carry his his name director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine you can do that of course\nAnd they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nWow I I guess may maybe the only thing in that is that you could ... your name coming out because the the trustworthy else he might get first building\nAnd there's there's only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere\nYou're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately before you announce close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skip town if you can write when they're gonna announce it so that you're not there and you know you work in the media as you've seen when\nAnything major happens in the news the\nMedia starts hunting down any pictures that they can of you or you know all the details because everybody wants to know so you know some experts have said close all that stuff down just to help avoid it\nThat's one of the first tips that I've gotten from multiple experts is yet tried to get off social media because like you said that's the first place that not just reporters look but\nPeople that might want to start contacting you for money for charity and that's another issue is that you know a lot of charities that will tend to reach out to jackpot winners they all digital", "city": "Oklahoma City"}
