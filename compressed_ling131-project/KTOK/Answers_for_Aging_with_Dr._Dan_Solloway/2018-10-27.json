Laura I served for eleven years in the United States Army\nWhile I was on a combat patrol and Bob Iraq a rocket propelled grenades to farm off the shoulder when I came home I felt alone my family was around me but I couldn't talk to them about what I'm saying what I've done I remember just thinking man\nThough I Am right now I don't want to live a I was discharged from the army and I've been working with the wind more products is two thousand and some don't have to be severely wanted to be with them on the border project and you have a lot of guys that have posttraumatic stress for\nBeing able to share your story I guess it kind of helps you wrap your mind around what did happen over there\nJust because you've left the military doesn't mean your life is over because when these guys are coming home I'm kind of leading and train them as over combat I'm leaving them train them to hail if I come away with anything from one of our products has given my life back\n... and yes I Do suffer ...\nDon't suffer in silence contact wounded warrior project dot org [noise]\nMorning in Oklahoma welcome back yes we are back I think we're having fund a I'm ray trouble with ... plumbing the red river I'm visiting with my friend Darryl with Mother Nature festival on it's a house soccer I on one thousand\nKatie okay uh so you know we're talking about the mole crickets talk about pets showing up in the toilet big big fear right of that happening any kind of made me and then you talked about insects being in candy\nUh in on pizza [laughter] did you do that by the way is that real it's happening right now okay ah ah so or something I wanted to ask about this is a total curve ball but another big fear that I think people have that has been perpetuated by Hollywood on TV and the horror movies\nIs that there are insects in particularly spiders\nThat will bite you and lay their eggs in the bite\nOr and so you get this oh this bump that that swelled up on your arm or your space and when the bump pops open a bunch of these little bugs come crawling out of it just all the mood in the movie\nWas uh\nWhat's the movie where the the people they always have a vision that everyone's going to die and then they all run and they don't die and then does comes after one by one oh flat liners ... butler ... I'll think of it okay [laughter] I Will think of it\nBut it shows like spiders crawling out of her skin you know ... oh it was a pimple yeah and that's what happened a spider linen and laid an egg and she has a polling with a puppet see I didn't like a hundred spotters come running up and they started popping out of ... ...\nIs that can that really happened or is that I doubt it is that Hollywood you know taking a paranoia\nAnd and playing on I Would think if that could happen we would see that on the news quite a bit yeah 'cause I Would be a pretty big story ... especially since you I mean spiders we're in here on the show right now they'd be like look guys were not late any eggs on your skin but you people keep eating as a ...\nSo you know the real monsters are y'all [laughter]\nThat's not an ed and yes to the book pizza it's real let somebody else ...\nLet me see I don't believe it is real scorpion pizza\nThat was just one of them I mean you could that be scorpions isn't your exert taste you could go with millipedes are crickets are\nWow I Can't believe it says it's on the pizza yeah that's the ... and that's the food truck that arsenal oh wow okay well I I Apologize for acting like I thought you were crazy\nThat's pretty freaky and that is pretty freaky um well I guess that's one way to do our part and diminishing the insect population is to start mixing them into our food because Americans we all love to eat so [laughter]\nAnd you can figure out of date make crickets a taste like John ranchers I guarantee you won't you won't find they'll get scarce it'll kind of like you know ah\nWhen ah you you see the documentaries and you see the jungle and you hear all these birds chirping and all this wildlife and it's just beautiful\nAnd then the little indigenous kids come through there and it gets dead silent\nAnd uh I one of the documentaries I was watching said do you notice how the sound has gone away and you don't even hear a bird chirping and you know the person that's on the documentary says yes what what's that about\nAnd I said it's because these kids are deadly with their blow darts and all these all these birds and stuff you know it and so they get quiet because they've learned that these kids\nAre our hunting ruin it they will shoot them with their blow dark and so they've learned to hide from that is great uh say anyway where\nI going with that some of you might be wondering [laughter] we're going somewhere I was saying I'm I'm just trying to prove my theory that if a if we made it crickets or a snack\nYeah and kids grew up liking crickets I'm saying you wouldn't worry about 'em squeaking in your house because you know they would be hiding from the kids [laughter]\nCrickets are so good you know it I went there for a drag on that as a matter there's got to be protein into me hey listen you get hungry enough man I mean I watch those movies with Schwarzenegger and Rambo and they're\nIn all of these devices like live explosive so law enforcement officials are now working across the country to track down ... percent are people responsible\nFor sending all of these suspicious packages that was Thursday morning and they know that actor Robert De Niro which is one of these packages it was intercepted by someone on his security detail who\nHappens to be at risk hired Newark police officer and noticed this similarity in the packages and he was actually able to call the bomb squad directly to get that wow\nHandled as quickly as possible we also know that two packages were sent to or where it needs to address to former vice president Joe Biden and they were discovered at Delaware postal facilities and we're we're in his late Thursday morning\nI think the investigation now has centered in on Florida they think that a lot of the packages might have originated out of there\nAlthough investigators naturally believe that some of the package math and delivered by hand by Korea they've now concluded that all had more likely than through the mail and a similarity across all of these packages is that the return address was the office\nOf Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of course the name was also misspelled\nBut there are a lot of similarities that we're seeing with all of these packages they each had\nAbout ... first class stance on that and they were very heavily tape in manila envelopes lined with bubble wrap all the mailing labels were printed on a computer so the bottom line here at that uh fortunately no one was hurt that authorities are still\nUnsure of why these bombs seemingly to be structured similarly to pythons didn't go off and now the question is whether that was because of their intention to simply incite fear and not harm or if there was a technical flaws that prevented it from going up\nAnd because of the similarities all the with the packaging and the actual devices themselves they do believe they're all connected\nWe don't know if it's a single person or group of people but they're all connected that way I Know experts have said that because the device has been knocked off there is a treasure trove of forensic clues that they can look at anything from DNA fingerprints\nAnd that's obviously where the investigation of starting I mean they're even looking at video when the packages first made it into the postal system you know everything is tracked by video when it starts in the postal system so they're trying to like retroactively go back to see where it started and if there's any video of a person maybe dropping off or something\nIt's almost like they're trying to start from the end of the construction of the device then work their way back\nSo for now the packages have either a rise are still being sent to Quantico the lab and Virginia and what they're going to try to do is traced this as it as that could include DNA or fibers found on the packages fingerprints on the back of the\nStance or on the tape there'll be getting this assembling\nThese packages that tend to trace them back to their fender and so now they're going to try and see whether the constructor of these seemingly pipe bombs whether they left them sort of\nThing that sure whether they left some sort of air enemy wiring and maybe that was sort of their trade so there are a lot of clips that investigators now have to put together they just have a big puzzle ahead of them\nAnd we learned a little bit more about the devices themselves they said they were made out of PVC pipe covered with black tape beach I like a small battery some wires maybe some broken glass for maximum damage but is there anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very few details about the specific the the the fight that they were saying that these are capable of being lies explosive whether or not they are it's still unclear we know that they have taken X rays that these explicit\nThan are examining those and are going through the wiring and the battery is and the overall material that these are constructed from\nIt's hard to ignore who the targets are George Soros the Clintons the Obamas CNN and John Brennan Eric Holder Debbie Wasserman Schultz as you've said is the return address for all of the ten devices\nRepresentative Maxine Waters Joe Biden Robert Deniro these are all high profile Democrats and critics of the president the administration how was the president been responding\nThat President has largely been hunting blame off of himself and his rhetoric and back\nOnto the media so that we thought different Trump rally from his normal show on Wednesday night it was absent from the lock her up chant while he was speaking are fake news referendum says as he points\nBack at the end of the ... and criticizing the media and the crowd goes wild he did however at that rally\nCalls for the media to unite the country he also tweeted on Thursday again blaming the media for that these that that have very big part of the anger that we've seen in our society is caused by basically fake\nNews and that it's gotten so bad that it's beyond description so what we see here is something very standard of the president uh these days says\nThat he is not wanting to take the blame for himself I Would imagine that would be pretty careful that played in Pakistan in the mid term that work to ... that the blame for that and putting it back to one of his easiest targets which is the media\nYeah it's going to be interesting to see how it all shakes out the investigation is ongoing I Know details are going to be coming in and changing every day and the man hunt is on to see who or what group might have Sundays out thank you very much Lauren Meyer reporter for access thanks for joining us thank you so much [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] it's election\nSeason and you know you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this here for political campaigns to reach voters is not through these ads on social media it's not TV it's not these robo calls\nIt's flooding cell phones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate the rules on automated both taxing it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McCain but he's a tech reporter at ... for more on this\nAnd these are what are called peer to peer messages so used to be said robo calls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial media can dial more people because it's a machine during that island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls and robots ... these are actually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line and are becoming more popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use where it'll auto film whatever message it is the key as you were saying the peer to peer these campaigns need somebody to literally hit send for every single one and they say that these people can ... of them an hour\nRight I mean they use these platforms on both the left in the rye problems like open sesame for us all to open up the right hospital or to on the on the left to send these tax and it's essentially building a a platform to do that\nAt scale and of course it's not entirely unlike phone banking we all know that people can go and they can call and they have political candidates often a common space with other people supporters so it's not entirely on like that in terms of\nBeing another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rape of like about Ninety percent basically if they send it to you you're more than ... percent likely to actually open it and read some of it at least so the the engagement is there\nAnd open to me which one of these providers to Ninety percent of tech method is a red within five minutes and I mean I think that is in St Louis we know how impactful that could be given that we get\nSo much political email so much political mail in this election in every election now and there's so much messaging that any way to break through the voters is a big deal for him and\nThis was the daily died weekend edition
