{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "Rounding payment cocker thing and the treatment that the patient okay\nRiley Griffin reporter for Bloomberg News thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having me [noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll right I'm Glad we're finally here this is my favorite story of the week we've all heard stories about passengers flying with ah their cats and their dogs in some cases I don't know why this is so popular but they're miniature horses it's people flying with their emotional support animals\nAnd you'll deliver is longer than that to peacocks hamsters a duck wearing a diaper I Wish I could have seen that deprecating pigs unfortunately the latest one in this line of emotional support animals is a lady flying with her pet squirrel or I'm Sorry your emotional support squirrel\nI'm I brought in my producer Miranda for more details on this just to find out how crazy to stories and we also talk about what steps you need to take to actually get cleared to have an emotional support animal\nThis woman was removed from a frontier airlines flight late Tuesday night when she tried to fly with her emotional support squirrels and then she refused to get off the plane after being told no according to the airline so frontier spokesperson made a statement and said that\nYes the passenger did fall apart a call by calling them in advance and saying that she would be flying with an emotional support animal but she never specified that it would be anything other than the typical dog or cat right they had no idea that they were going to have a rodent on board\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flights\nSo if it seems to be some type of policy\nOkay that could have been figured out she called in advance so he said the flight was traveling from Orlando to Cleveland they told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take other passengers off the plane everybody how to get off so that they can be plain hurt they had\nTo call the police forcibly remove her from the flight right and that in an of itself is a huge pain there is a fun fact I think you can share this rent a frontier airlines features a variety animals on the tails of its plant\nYeah so they're saying that they have animals on the tails of their planes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar\nSame made a score of course they did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering them because we have a little bit of audio [noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses there it is again miniature horses seem to be white ... auto wanting the question becomes how do people get emotional support animals\nI feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better there's actually a political that you need to go through to have an emotional support and well\nThere's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses are not required to accommodate them\nSo things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the her service dog because you're blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain an emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed\nYou have to actually go to a mental health professional\nRight and they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental illness are mad motion on disability you may have and from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they be well behaved and not jerks in public right don't have to have any kind of special training\nAll domesticated animals may qualify as an emotional support em cats dogs mice rabbits birds hedgehogs rats mini pigs ferrets the list goes on and on\nSo they can be any age can be happy it can be a kitten it doesn't have to be a full grown\n... so this world could very well have qualified to be an emotional support animal I think she had it in some type of carrier and like it wasn't going to run around and cause a bunch of trouble\nBut less than a delta spokesperson said that they've had issues with these emotional support animals on fights including dog's having panic attacks needing to get oxygen administer to them the flight attendants being bitten by other support animals ducks just wandering the aisles blocking the beverage cards\nI Wonder if she did have a letter saying that it was an emotional support animal I Know a lot of people forge those things because they're pretty easy it's yes basically a doctor is now is what I\nMean there's even Web sites where you can go on line still at a yes or no questionnaire and print out your certificate sort of like becoming ordained to do your friend's wedding\nThat's just ... it's a tough thing because\nRiding in a plane is a common space you're in tight quarters you got to share that space and be respectful of other people\nAnd you never know what's going to happen with an animal poop and pee all over the place I'm like I said I think the squirrel was probably not going to be that big of a problem but you know once the flight attendants are asking you to get off the plane it's already going to be a problem\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOh man I just love that you know I'm not typically a nervous flier at all I Do get a little wary when you know the turbulence starts hitting but other than that I'm pretty solid when it comes to fly how 'bout you Miranda\nDepends on the people that I see at the gate if they're all just kind of chilling and looking at their phones I'll be good yeah but if there are a bunch of rowdy people or they're drunk already opposite and it'll\nCause that anxiety or you depending on how everybody else's so here's the important question Randy if you did get anxious what would your emotional support animal be and it can be a cat or dog has got to be a little ... something a little more exotic\nOkay cause might go to is I'm going to bring my dog I ... I Would have\nBrought my own dog as well but you can't do that this is something\nIn the line of a peacocks and hamsters can I have an emotional support turtle there you go that's a\nThat's a good one they're quiet they're kind of cute in com that is true that my animal turtle\nI think my emotional support animal would be a slop [laughter] because they moved again they're quiet they don't get into too much action but I'll take that long I think that'd be cute and something fun to a good conversation started Oh thank you Miranda thanks [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAll right that's it for us this weekend is sure to check out the daily died every Monday through friday joined us on social media at daily diet of pot on Twitter\nDaily podcast on\nLeave us a comment give us a rating tells the stories that you're interested in\nAll of the daily diving I heard radio subscribe wherever you get your pocket\nThe daily dive is produced by random er into an engineer by Tony ... [noise]\nI'm Oscar mares in Los Angeles and this was your daily dive weekend edition [noise]\nAm an ex X Y fmri Ninety six boys want\n[noise]\nListening as to what she has to say and it's like now giving her greens if he hears the odds then\nAnd the whole thing is a bit was among those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on and somebody has presented as an expert on something like I'll have\nAn author on are all have a geologist on are all have a an actor honor and I'll say this is an activity you might remember from this this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um here's the president's son\nYou'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks will say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person is getting paid for your parents or an analyst generally speaking peppers and getting paid too but they keep on presenting a listen a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her\nAnd address illicit mulatto says we need an equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on it and USA Today I'm I'm confused why are we doing a story and listen to the lotto\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then\nChristie lousy for and what have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care white illicit model thinks why she's not an expert\nI talked about this by talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we've seen on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time\nAnd we set ourselves well we were you for some reason project intelligence on them\nAlyssa Milano is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense\nYet the the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers in general Americans I guess where the dumb people out here like a like me to buy you into this far left wing garbage\nListen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't help their side they think she does but she doesn't want to listen to the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me\nSay well I'm definitely not going to vote that way lookout dumb ... the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos well sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth well we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\nThey don't misunderstand me and I said it's where the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously but you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe it once it's proven\nWell there you go and you turn on the job or you're you're ... you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe it was the model because filling them went\nJust doesn't happen oh another trending thing that's happening today which will boggle your mind is Robert ...\nRobbery ... of course the Confederate general who lost\nAnd had to surrender to to us rent\nAllegedly if you believe in the news of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio\nAnd praised Robert ...\nPeriod and the story and of course that's the only period and the story of your legacy media that lies to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you all know that the\nPresident said it that way so if they say the president praised Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised rubbery layer be telling the truth yes\n\nBut it's also a scent of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd than they are fantastic it's worth it's the best thing ever going to go to my my plane they'll go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good vetting kicked vis guys asking this guy was really good\nThat was the context but why tell the truth when you can lie and then correct it later and by the way on social media when you lie under your your legacy media tens of thousands of a retreats likes when you're correct it a few hundred that's the way it goes in this day and age\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero bottom of this hour it's gonna be former Governor Sarah Palin\nThe great state of Alaska

er syrup Haywood yes that Sarah Palin the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee\nFor vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened and in our show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and are you hoping you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream we watch it because the scenery behind her as beautiful in Alaska but to lose ... boys and girls who served ... how are you\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole for Black Friday because people know I was actually on this was unfolding on me or live you're listening but I was telling them what was going on and and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew\nWho said heights or a pale in a bit of the kids up and drop the kids often and I'm listening just want to see a good point they should ... you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said it's really me I promise\n[laughter]\nGoing back and forth and I needed it oh\nMy goodness somebody cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot and we get along so thank you for doing that and do you know it's funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Alaska listening I was trying to get up and I must I Am I trying to verify me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email bedrooms are appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone let me face time you must have settled this once and for all and is it good as we got to figure the fake you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone my own work by that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all the button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you brush the boat you took my first time in ... her but Tina Fey that's her that's\nOut there you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding uh in in Washington DC I still to this day sure I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator as a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican\nIQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\n[noise] no and go back even further\nFrom her writing campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's her dad Senator Frank were kept you after having served twenty two years in the U.S Senate he gave his daughter the job when he was elected\nGovernor up here right there on charming and I ran against him in defeated him read that's how we got and that's how we said they didn't essentially command once you're in\nAnd you have these special interest from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no\nRational reason that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about calls like of course it is and whether either good manners\nYes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor with this kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate but you but you are you like was it up and circuit court of appeals that I'll I'll repeat that in the second it's us or opinion of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course\nThe former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain was going to write in my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nSo and I think a lot of people actually did that the enemy friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in\nThe United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court is eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost every really would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment check amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nExactly right and Joe I was pressed because nobody else was talking about that book share what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out\nI don't know about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskan because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power\nAnymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that

getting that anonymous strange a message on Facebook\nEnded up getting the interview and we will have run again and again and again um I Do hope she runs that of Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski showed

allegedly there are checks and balances in place but I don't trust that a lot of his electronic voting um I I think ... is scary because you can hack\nThese machines I don't know how to do it but but you know these these guys out there do know how to do it if you're going to happen during our government or hack into baseball ... acting to fill in the blank Yahoo um if you could do those things after you do a lecture machine\nI Would think would be very hard um so I don't know how we guarantee that I I got to tell you Doug I I've been voting for as long as I can remember and I can't tell you for sure that my vote counted every time\nI still go and I'll continue to go but we are leaving it to a very small number of people to validate something that that we all hope ... they'll get right it's a great question I don't have a good answer\nAs fast you know all of a sudden it's about a whole box of votes were counted in critical lectures and it's like\nOh well we have I I'm guessing that you're you might be referring to Minnesota where Al Franken won and he shouldn't have but suddenly there were votes that were somebody's car trunk\nIt just doesn't make any sense and it is it's a scary proposition although I bullied a little bit by the ... the election results in twenty sixteen ... election that will that would've been the one but I think they let their guard down I ...\nThey

Seventy years you're telling me Seventy years ago how they do the exact rice said em oh this is a modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing on the ... of the

as that can said\nIt doesn't matter what I Do it to another human being because I have to have the power and that's why it was so important I I couldn't put this in my book you know why we fight because it happened off they came out but when the president stood out\nIn the White House two days ago in front of the world I pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did the justice Kavanaugh and then for announced an innocent that was a historic moment because just as what it could chambers was innocent Seventy years ago so\nIs justice capital eight year old man who the

book so go and get that as well get the audio book as well so so let me ask you about this ... this whole idea from the left\nThat that you so well say actually talk to my my friend did go denounced as soon as about this as well he goes back even further even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has been known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have a outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving in this justice Kevin\nDecided I'm not going to given I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and pull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I

great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well with the actors that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked about bad we talked about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well uh ... how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know Texas but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I I can see their travel\nOn Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia where did you know that that was gonna tell all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the\nEnergy revolution runners off that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent ...\nAnd uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as a as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know a salesman\nFor American energy whether it's a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that\nOught to be their job it's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining you know good he's putting terms is going to ruin trade\nAnd in no time slabs biggie you stepped up and said we're making the deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade that in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the bill how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have\nA role to play in that and and so absolutely there's a there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth a\nAnd a ... everybody's on the same team I Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like it for a lot of reasons that I you know\n... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] sure of that\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade yet and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine uh and and that's exactly\nWhat he's doing with these trade deals or he comes with some really hard stuff I\nMean you think about it with you and then a young and came back in here uh after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but ... ... a trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and\nLet's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later the Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese or they'll lose a trade war with us so yeah\nI guess where their biggest customers they don't want to screw with us\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want to stay in R. I. P. either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRight oh good neighbor yeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still\nBooming under the great guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised\nAt how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it is these\nThings were outdated you know think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is when it was side that was twenty five years ago and and think about where America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were\nDependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who ... a a developing a the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president would say you know what\nTime to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh U.
