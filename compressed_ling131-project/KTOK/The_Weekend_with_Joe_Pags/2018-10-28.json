{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "And Disneyland have that it's a favorite spot for people to scatter the ashes of their family members once they've passed these think it's like one of the ultimate tributes that you can have their Miranda real quick if you were going to have your ... and then where would you have them spread it\nProbably Indiana Jones 'cause that's my favorite right\nI Would go on space mountain and I just want somebody to throw me up in the air so that it gets all over everyone and everything I worried they're going to sweep the lead guy ended the night that's what happens actually so\nWe spoke to Eric Schwartz all he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal and he spoke to several families who have actually done this they were very forthright about it they snuck the ashes in the spread them out in different places Disneyland holds a really special place in a lot of people's hearts and it just makes sense that people would want to\nHave it be their final resting place oh here's ... with more about the big secret from Disneyland\nI'm so glad to hear you say that it made a lot of sense to you and made a lot of sense to me to it without something I'd ever thought about but whenever I heard that this was a popular place it spread ashes it was like oh of course people love going to Disneyland it makes sense that someone want to spend eternity there and when I started talking to the custodians who work in both parks\nThey told me Oh yes it's very much a thing of always been these rumors about it but it does happen\nAnd it so much to the point that they have a code word for did they say it's a habit clean up so\nIf you are a worker who sees what you suspect are human\nAshes maybe left on the seat of a ride or something like that you radio over and you say we have a clean up and that means you need to grab the hyper allergenic vacuum because the custodians will then come by and if they do indeed identified the substance of human ashes they will suck them up in a vacuum and clean it up all everyone you know leaves the premises and\nGoes on to other rights before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually notice it it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency we were talking about a really quick about how much it makes sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like can we stay here forever so it really means\nSomething to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading these ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks and they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it\nSo they have to get creative\nSeveral of them smuggled the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I've talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's or in in the hotel bathroom into a pill bottle that she\nCould then fungal pass park security while others will\nSimply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a purse or an ... that that's gotten through security as well and then once they're inside if they want us to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the ... dark so no one sees them other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of the park that doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who and two thousand nine spread the ashes of her mother and at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn\nOutside Cinderella Castle and ran across the grass flinging them she ran why and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have\nPhotos of the sit there and I just saw you know so so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn flinging ashes doesn't get notice I mean I Can't imagine how many people do this\nAnd never get caught but you're right that in talking to custodians that consensus that I arrived at what did it happen about once a month but I've heard stories of it happening more frequently I heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I think the park has says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney\nSo it was one of pride that you know at this point\nYeah it's a point of pride it's also I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and\nSomething that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved ones final wishes so it was something that they were really touched by an and actually quite eager to share it with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the spread these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gates [laughter]\nLove the quote someone said that the hunted mentioned probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that's one of those places obviously we know what the hunted mentioned ride is all about spooky and what not and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives a whole new meaning you know the next time I'm going to be the I'm going to be like trying to look for human ashes there\nWell I take that as the ultimate compliment I mean I think the last I heard\nSo many examples that I can say safely say that human ashes and spread all over these parks the haunted mansion is definitely the most popular destination but it's a small world also had quite a strong showing based mountain pirates of the Caribbean I mean\nReally if you think about it they're probably been human ashes spread there and I don't quite know why the ... the hunted Manchin is so I mean obviously it's on theme right for the practice but in talking to people who work in the hot I mentioned they described just to sort of general obsession among certain fans\nWith the haunted mansion I also think that it's probably strategically a pretty good spot because it's very dark\nAnd there are a lot of places where you can sort of in conspicuously into it\nKnowing this now gives all these rides new meaning when they find ashes and they have to go through the process of locating it cleaning it up they'll close the rides and say they're closer technical difficulties and I've\nAlways seen rides closed for technical difficulties before it could be something mechanical but this is also one of those other reason so what's that process when they identify what they think it is and then how do they go through about cleaning\nSo this is a process that will kick start on rights like the hunting mansion so safe or ride comes around people leave and they see some what they think are are human ashes on the seats\nThey will clear out the premises they'll radio over for ... to clean up\nThey often do you tell people that there are technical difficulties that they need to attend to and then they will hit out fast passes\nTo people because you know you're standing in line for an hour and then suddenly they say the right to shut down and you have to leave you got to give him something wrong with people are going to get upset so then the the vacuum and it's come in and they suck it up you know in a manager will often ride the ride by themselves so that they can look and see like are there any\nAshes anywhere in the rye that we need to go in identifying and sweep up and then resume business\nA number of the people I spoke to also dumped ashes in the water of these ride like on pirates and on it's a small world so the water I think it's probably a pretty impossible place to to discover it you're not going to see that especially in some of those darker rides\nYeah I mean it's a really fun read it's perfect for Halloween Eric sports reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us\nA thank you and if you do see any ashes on the hundred mansion please call me so I can do a follow up [laughter] it definitely was a great thank you\n[laughter]\nThat's it for us this weekend be sure to check out the daily diving every Monday through friday joined us on social media\nAt nearly died pot on Twitter and daily podcast on please leave us a comment give us a rating tells the stories that you're interested in\nAll of the daily diving I heard radio subscribe wherever you get your podcasts\nThe daily diet has produced on random er into an engineer by Tony earn Tina I'm Oscar mares in Los Angeles and this was your daily dive weekend edition [noise]\nOkay am and gay X. X. Y. FM Ninety six point one age detail\nLegacy disgusting media reporting that it's the Margot bomber the make America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no\nNot the case what you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him the smog bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter editing rational baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do\nThat's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news as as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible\nHatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\n\nYou know it also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American his first name as Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well as all sort of reports that he's a talent in Filipino\nThe media always though quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman\nThe guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of them in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic\nSo then they started calling him a white Hispanic so dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest than even more than that I mean it looks like at some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected anything here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican in twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual sent into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's\nFor the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this I guess there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow a inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou have you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist and Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK\nThe media school with that you're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for putting that's okay that's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example at the example of that but the media again playing the victim in fact Jemma concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or engaged\nOver the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind this is a guy whose job is supposed to be to go there to report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president ... mentioned\nHe has to make for you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who've committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like\nOne side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible\nOr by the way the the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian is family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or an American Indian and the other one sounded Italian first name certainly sounds Hispanic\nWho knows what he is when we do know is he was some promoter for shipping nails and some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the leftist trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid and the media needs to learn it's job again the job\nIs to go there observing and tell us what you saw is not go there observant and tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews\nI might take some false flag Paul Ryan's led Charlie go I'm I'm not going to do conspiracy theories today that that that's that's stupid

County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border and deals with illegal immigration all the time I Want to know how he's preparing for the caravan heading this way\nAnd and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to work has to do as it gets here a sheriff I appreciate you how are you\nDoing great thanks yeah ...\nIt was always appreciate it really had a good time with you at the fair and get together in Washington DC\nGot some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six one I've got to do for his standing next to you but ah it it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job in especially in a watching you out there on live TV I saw out they're interacting with people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people\nI've seen police officers you know guys like this to go walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't steak I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to two\nI'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm gonna see at the store these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what is what it is going on in their life to put him to this point yeah so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect we tried to go from there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that you can you can attract more ... than you can ...\nAnd in watching you interact in a good share of mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you think is there a percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand but you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police ...\nIs there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those ...\nOr ... difficult to deal yeah yeah yeah you know I'm I'm a believer in communist power if you walk out your calm and they can steal that they don't steal your laptop it it really helps that situation go a lot smoother you may see eye to arrest\nAnd ended up going to last but there's some people that are just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching your chair of mark ... County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like lie pd and others um is that when you walk up\nYou're generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you'd probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to know where you could still get them home tonight I mean that's it's kinda it's\nI didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and it we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\nJust relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently I think if you just stay calm let's work through it um and it does give us the ability to use that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to we get stack on a kind of charges to know it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nIntroducing Martha ...

with the um the chairman of the house ways and Means Committee the uh the the district that Republican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code working on the tax playing with President Trump or we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke\nAnd also about what does this do tax cut plan that we keep hearing about Kevin I appreciate you how are ya\nHey I'm good thanks for having me on you know what what\nAn incredible time we're living in right now want to get it to the incredible succession the positivity\nThat came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to knock today a first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI shows was this idiot that sends out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what do you think yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history of uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all of this but we do you know this is a person that frankly um and I don't know what to green how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a lawn right let me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it I had to get it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these postal facilities and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e fighters advice early on and said you know someone stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady the house ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that\nUm is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him a demographer bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber speak to people did not called the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a sander shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I'll tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had to miss the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or apt I took some a swing so do you want to take some ground or is the second I looked out the was take them I Know I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shooting so\nUh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder and began to list we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well the pilots happens they made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them camp down their rhetoric a little bit\nBut what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm gonna blame the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know I it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there\nAnd we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and the fact that it's thirty five forty years later the media looks back on a regular you know lovingly and and they do love and back then um and and they're treating from horribly in basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds\nThis president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point but thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that are ... the economy for decades in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half\nReally and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges from\nThe Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to you again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair\nOr it would be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you\nYour Joe I Want to come on but I only have two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every\nAmerican that pays taxes got a break every American who pays taxes as a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses where they got raises companies are are no\nManufacturing stuff here again or promising gift to start doing it so the other side Devin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going\nBack to the old a code where\nMonth we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest or
