Instagram email All right here's a live video feed is there as well as easy to get to top thing just press play\nWhere you open it up on your on your device or when you open it up on your computer or you've got the weekend with Joe ... had a great opportunity to talk to my friend Eric Trump earlier this week of course the son of president Donald Trump on all things that you would imagine we would talk about or got appreciate ... hey back how are you\nKnow I'm living the dream but it's going great today I'm ... and we've got a big debate too and I was you know it's gonna be Ted Cruz speaking on a Robert ... going to go back go for some reason I'm not sure why but that's going to happen and she said it's only ... tonight in that race is probably not as close as the media's pretending but we really can't take it for granted right\nThat you gave her thing for granted people have to go out and they have to vote and then the the amount you I hear people say to me what my guy my guys Trump he's done a you know he's not a ballot or something I could go and vote and I go please you can't think that way you have to get out and vote idiots so critically important I mean\nJoe as a country we're winning I mean everything about our country is winning right our economy is not fired for point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in the history of our nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years\nYou know we have the largest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history a manufacturing going back to our nation for one case or through the roof small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes and they were a year ago which is just created such a financial engine\nUm I mean we are doing so incredible that's before you start talking about you know president for and what you need to be done in the opioid crisis taking on a Supreme Court justices and\nPrescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs you know something that is is is so keen on his mind you I'm going to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off by China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now which you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right right oh while America has the strongest economy that's ever hatch who's winning thing right and and that's what he promised the American people even get a daily problem with the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get get use nip used to the country and\nBut people have to get out there they have to get out and do\nIt it's our Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump Jr absolutely right or good as I watch these races each very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying is in races across the country you've seen those all the advertising you're saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddy Ted Cruz give a tax cut to his corporate bridge the top one percent of the vast majority of the tax cut everybody else got nothing that's ally that's not true everybody who pays taxes got tax cuts and corporations will employ you got a tax cuts are all make more money some people get bonuses so why\nDo you do about the large when you see the wide around but\nHonestly they are ... some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty politics again this is this in our world right where is that people were not we we will come out of a political world\nThese people were truly the most dishonest people in the entire world I mean you look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or you know dozens and dozens of millions of small business right now all across our\nOur nation they're getting they're paying Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he's flash regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment that's the reason you have the lowest Hispanics\nUnemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history the lowest female unemployment in the history you know what I mean\nIt's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where do you know this better name but you have a trade deal with with with China where if you said the product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five to fifty percent and terrorists right where they can make the same product over there they could send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean\nWho do you think's gonna win that battle I mean it absolutely unbelievably well we we over tax companies we over regulated you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre are that the economy of this country went crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the stock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception\nOf the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K. you know every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and that they have jobs and they're not working two or three jobs than that they're getting pay increases\nBelieve me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that and then they terms but again people have to go out and vote\nFor Trump to sort of president Donald Trump also drop it a national interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go bows or give us raises millions more people go up ... a small businesses are adding employees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone\nThey slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada said no way we're going to do it then maybe the deal Mexico said no way we're gonna do it the ... do you use it in a way we're going to do with them they made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the Bakken how weird as well\nHow about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world really keep your doctor you're supposed\nTo be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs you know flew through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the prescription drug um\nLegislation that road has drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs you you you look at right to try to look at so many of these different efforts and you know that's right because you know the politicians had been stuck in a mindset um their entire lives and then they don't care about actually governing they just want to keep themselves\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nUm when he made the announcement I'm I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this\n... jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process what it looked like\nYour father in law was really going to take the stuff\nHe actually that all of it down and said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous athlete or a\nDay during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell a lie about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rise\nUp but like I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew that my father in law can do this job he's a businessman he is so smart when it comes to negotiating seeing when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what Tara with trade um\nHe's really great at that and I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this\nUm it it's it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of things going on here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because\nI really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents of countries ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or husband his or her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty sixteen or because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expected that the media would come after the leopard come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was this completely unexpected he said no I Know that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice four thirty and forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper or on their television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday le left but I didn't know was going to be like this show when ... when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and I ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said that um that that was it it it wasn't very clear wine to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for\nForever if you know he became president ...\nBut um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked\nMy unborn child needs to make them talk about it is it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to became president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life is going to come to an end so\nUm I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family members you to my wife is Lara Trump or Iraq because her husband her father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes\nThe midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote in Texas where I should you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent who is doing an incredible job in working with your with your brother in law a very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided touches but under the surface those you know he's a far left wing socialist disco ward you look at places like Michigan or W ... been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show it to real seat this really used gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the reruns and go vote for him is really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will\nGet onto your day ironically in Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and not with a lot of people against and even people want and don't party sometimes money and get them ...\nThink about what could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted alongside president and and really pushes agenda forward we can be so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism\nIf anybody has any question about what social and them look like look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening\nSocialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that since shock everybody to a degree that you you not only are going to get out and vote in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nUm it it's very area and I I Know that it felt like a fight and twenty things seem to get Donald Trump elected in ... he certainly was the fight isn't over you and you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent me have to get out\nAnd got to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nIs only run if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to them in their shoes are delicious whose whose wife was from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting it is there I mean there are people waiting in line for food and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first is made him in the country could as horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country\nOr tells you a ... you got people who are actually showing this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nLower than last question I really appreciate your time and by the way of luxury Minnesota we reached Asians or we were very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul MTV okay they're hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts and take more of your money away it will drive jobs out of the country that's\nWhat they are running on and it's not just there almost fifty fifty right known almost every poll you see what is it that we're doing wrong you went to Eric in a done junior the president of\nThe the Fox News Hannity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that crazy to me\nWell I don't know Joe that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the Cold War and ... and a great point but I don't really think that if that\nIs out there I think there are people that are afraid\nTo tell a pollster that call them or approaches them on the street said they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood has done such a a number on on people whenever they come out in support of the president or as a Republican I'm so I think it does make people a little\nHesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth\nWhenever no one else is looking when they think about the ... where we come in this country in almost in less than two years under President Donald Trump through\nAnd they think about their children in the future of the country I really think that they're going to vote Republican and um\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] no\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nWell what are your stations across the land Joe package dot com visuals literature to read an email all the way through the live video feed is well plus\nThe blaze radio network it's the weekend\nWith Joe ... one eight hundred ... all one Seventy eighty Joe ... comments they said uh Michelle ... is a great political commentator great author she's investigative\nJournalist has got our own TV show and she also is this your mental raising money for this God's know movie the movie about the abortion doctor that was killing people um who is now spending ... sentences behind behind prison bars\nWanted to get what they were about how hard it was to raise money for the movie plus of course we have a dog Pocahontas we have talked to germs Michelle are ...\nGood how are you doing I'm doing great ... taking a ton of want to jump into the gods no movie er which sort of piqued my interest the other day that's why I reached out to you but acute knocks dark with Elizabeth Warren of turns out he was one one thousand twenty four\nNative American so I'm Out in the left media the show now says she's basically like a a jerky queen [laughter] that's right what am I missing here\nShe has been vindicated I I'm I'm I'm never\nFlabbergasted by the lengths to which the identity politics left will go to write you try and unwind\nBlatant lie ... this is a woman who advanced her career by manufacturing a a Native American ancestry that it's been debunked over and over and over again and I I really do believe that her staff was\nConvinced that by releasing the results of tests\nThat showed that she possibly\nHad Native American ancestry six to ten generations back yeah but that was based on a proxy of Native American blood right and in other words the researcher\nUsed South American genetic markers or some sort of of estimation for whether or not she really at this ancestry come on Joe this is someone who identified as a woman of color right in order to secure position in a in a prestigious Ivy League university\nIn a very real way Rachel does all is about as black is this woman is Native American and you know you're right there using what ... as Dr hoping they're praying that the south American blood somehow has some native blood and there is no proof in other words she's wider than I'll ever be site and in fact\nBy statistics that were quoted and none other than the New York times it turns out that this one one one one thousand twenty four fraction of a possible Native American bloodline make ... make sure her last\nIn other words than the average white American right more Native American ancestry than she\nA hundred percent but you're absolutely right about that at the Boston Globe tried to say that she was one thirty second at the at the most and one one thousand one\nAt the least they even had to update that four hours later to say okay maybe one sixty fours at at the moment when she was an army battalion I'm English I'm polish and Irish or you know these things and I'm I'm I'm actually about\nTwo thirds Italian the snow falls into place I have no clue one one thousand sixty fours anything else\nAnd nobody can ever we I don't think you'd never really find that out but then one tiny little marker on one ... scale amusing Trump's you don't need a million dollars in apologized or help me understand\nYeah yeah you know the the rich irony in a serious point is that this week I'm a very important cases being litigated by legitimate Asian American students have um suit Harvard University which awarded\nElizabeth Warren this a position as a as a professor right because of her fake claim and those Asian American students have on earth do all sorts of admissions\nDocuments showing that they were discriminated because they were Asian American and there were too many of them in the university system and it just goes to show you that you know the the ... the Olympics of grievance and the Olympics of identity politics brings us exactly to the to this point in time and it and it's\nAnd it and I think so many people are sick and tired of it I mean for the twenty five plus years that I have been an outspoken conservative quote unquote of color and yeah I'm darker than Brock Obama\nI've had all of these white progressive left is shouting at me that I'm not really my ethnicity because of my beliefs\nAnd that to me really is is the real offense here of of white liberal progressive telling true legitimate quote unquote people of color that they're not people of color while they're bracing phony like Rachel do at all and and Elizabeth Warren\nAnd all through shown getting in there as well yes and I salute ... dot com boom to read her blog on what you do the room as you know she's going to reduce showing your TV where she's at noon incredible investigative reporting um I wanted to do about ... I didn't know what your attachment was doing ... turns out it was really hard to\nRaise money for this movie it's basically a movie about\nWell it's actually called the wine with America's biggest serial killer I Believe this guy was America's biggest serial killer one show so much trouble to make obviously a very interesting um ... million one story\nWell uh the bottom line is that the a radical abortion is in the Democratic party and on the left\nI Do not want to acknowledge the horrors that are committed in the name of so called reproductive choice and my to the movie into the story goes back to two thousand eleven when almost nobody else was paying attention to the story I and I first blogged about the grand jury report", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "21"}
