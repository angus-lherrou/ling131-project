understand how anybody could think that Corning crying or at a man makes being guilty\nAnd you got to live for the most out if that's true but that's why the court case\nAnd I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously had a lot of classes that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice eat he he gets the great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have due process in this country now

with Kavanaugh rent if we let women like to come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women testifying by decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBickering women have notoriously done it when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist [noise] I\nHave a friend that would actually grew up in
