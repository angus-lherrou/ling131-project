{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "[noise] I Know you know I I totally agree with speaking of it because it ... everything came some weight everything from you\nAnd so I've struggled\nCome a long long way um\nYou become super vigilant to you you you don't trust anyone\nYou it wrong of everything you it's just very hard and it's\nDoing so that song that we just heard Rachel about why women are scared and and you know she's making fun of it being a white boys should be scared of the state of\nWomen that we understand that that way Rachel that it it it takes a way that safety that feeling of safety and\nYeah you're security here and you doubt yourself you doubt everything you know you asked yourself that I Do something what did I read something that was to revealing that you know you start to blame yourself like you said earlier the guilt\nThat that's a terrible thing to have to deal with too\nYeah and you know women women laugh because we say to each other we understand we all get our car keys out when we leave some places we worry about someone in the park following week\nYeah that's what I meant about being ... you you you you can't go to life happy free anymore you know you have to always be aware looking around and yeah yeah have you on your end we didn't\nWe know now I Know you you have a son and we don't in any way women don't want their their sons are boys accused in ... at all\nBut we do know that young women are vulnerable and we have to really step up and do what we can to make sure that that um [noise] our society has more open and I think that's what makes people went like Rachel so brave because she's\nHere tonight on air talking about this and how hard is that\nYeah you know Rachel I wanted to add that song was written by a teacher in Texas name Lindsay lab I wrote the song and posted it on the Internet and Jimmy Kimmel just happened to see it\nMore than ... people and it was in response to of course President Trump saying it's a very scary time for young men but much like yourself you were being so brave and it is helping so many people because we all second guess ourselves\nYes and I thank you so much for your time on a Sunday night\nOh you're very welcome is there anything else you'd like to say of the words of encouragement for people though yes through most\nDefinitely that there is hope you can kill you can become braver and and I have four granddaughters\nSo I always make them aware of these things and you know just to watch out and but not for also for them not to lose and Newt's themselves in the fear of it\nYou know to try to\nStill try to you know live a happy free life\nThat's such a great point and you know those are the things we can do go in and Rachel is we can we can focus on openness the more we talk about this the better it's going to be it's not going to be worse I mean there are people saying well why are we talking about all this but that's not true we need to shine light on this we need to\nAlways believe always believe people when they come forward because they're almost always as we've seen in the numbers\nThey're ... they're they're saying what's really happened\nAnd we said we need to not deny um we just need to understand that the accusations are rarely rarely false\nAnd we need to always be open to hearing about that we need to stress funding further funding for mental health care and prevention\nBecause St Louis region of all if we are educating and talking about it mhm\n[noise] well I think you both for this time this evening so a parting thoughts\nParty thought is things are going to get better you know what they really are there's a there's a new book out called in lightened that now\nBoth of you ought to read because you're both big readers and it was that there are really good things going and of course we all know that we need to get out and vote\n[laughter] yes take action and will\nWeaken women can make a huge difference in this time coming up\nWe'll Rachel I appreciate your time so much on a Sunday night and You're welcome you continue to heal thank\nThank you Rachel and welcoming gal thank you Bye bye bye And Gail yeah other thoughts you might know what\nThey thought that it it really literally that we just keep encouraging women the women in our lives and and the young men too I I had to talk to my grandson's about this I mean I think we need to talk\nWith both both boys and girls start teaching new directions and that's about really is about prevention 'cause I I this does not have to be this way does not have to continue to occur in our society\nDo you think of someone that is not a psychologist can be helpful enough to someone that is struggling with oh it almost happened to me or it should have happened to me or why you know I don't understand why didn't happen but I'm so grateful what can we say to support each other when we are not licensed psychologist\nI think that's a great question and and we can because you know just having a good girlfriend is so important to someone who says we called it ... we call it in psychology we\nCall it reflective listening and it's that thing that we we all know how to do that we really don't show up lots of times I get to teach that and in good therapy but it's just listing all the way through to what someone has to tell you and then\nYou know listening saying if she were expected listing all the way through and not trying to fix it or make plans for it but just helping someone expressed that and bring it out\n'cause sometimes they don't know how they feel like I say it do they they have no idea how they really feel until it comes out [laughter]\nThat's exactly right that's exactly right well thank you so much it was an excellent topic and I'm thinking for finding Rachel forests and they\nKeep protecting on the topics it's always clean you do and they're not easy it's not easy it was not easy for Rachel to be with us tonight but she she was brave and she did that so thank you again\nAll right let's talk say okay All right here thank you Bye bye\nAnd a gale Dr Gayle Hudson is a licensed psychologist in

Scott\n[noise] so uh I was oh shut off to the side\nAnd I waited there about a half an hour forty five minutes wonder if it's going to happen or not I have the equipment with me\nSo a a nice woman comes as the president's ready to see you know and I said well\nThank you so I walked hair walk back around came around the corner presidents like twenty feet away says bill hold on I'll be right with you\nI said I'm not going anywhere [laughter] I'm a I'm not going anywhere I'm right here so it came up with change some nice days he says he listens to me casually on Sunday night and thanks for what I Do on television for him I said no problem I Believe in what you're doing and I said to him I said look either concerning twenty sixteen\nNow when you got elected you were going to be like in New York Republican kind of a moderate Republican you've turned out to be well beyond my expectations I said you make Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal Democrat what you're doing\nThat is fabulous so we exchanged more nicely these small talk and said you ready for it I said let's go so I handed him a Mike and I took him Mike and I talked to him for like Thirteen minutes talked a little bit about the rally\nHappening a couple of hours later friday night we talked about the tariffs about Canada and Mexico talked about the show he talked about South Korea whenever the issues Kevin all whatever it was talking about Thirteen minutes and I said I'm going to run it Sunday night is that I may be listening\nAs well Mr President thank you very much so we're going to play that interview and about a twenty twenty five minutes at the bottom\nAnd then later on we have a Bill O'Reilly coming up and also a diamond in silk or I think fabulous and diamonds silk reminded me\nHit him on two or three months ago about how dangerous it is\nFor an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat\nThere is no more loyal partisan voting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women they vote like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but\nThere's no more loyal partisan group for the Democratic party than African Americans especially every American women\nSome as diamonds silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been\nTuesday and Wednesday and CNN hundreds Jeff Zucker viciously and racially using pejorative racial terms racism attacked Kanye West\nBakari sellers is a former Democratic or office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nSo he's you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and\nHe's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier\nWho's I coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this is an African American woman talking quote black folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him\nHe's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator\nSaying number one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Tonya in the racial draft they had it with him hey she's spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her and and it really couldn't it got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take Conyers seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble said that he's irrational and the madman snoop doggy dog eat dog eat cities local\nTom and so entertainers\nComics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas and Jessie Molly Peterson and Colin Powell\nAnd Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest\nThe Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools for generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration\nWhich has destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies which have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities\nThey've also Democrats who cripple the black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married\nIt goes on and on and on and this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon who\nWith venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they would be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as the terrorists arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy tests\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control way of what I watch free thinking African American men and women be partially destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line\nThey're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill by Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat's why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional\nThe black family is completely broken\nThere's no job creation the average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West step settle on him against their expressed support for a different political outlook\nHe has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book because it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm\nCan you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime and poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nWho was in Turkey in order to get like a permission to marry some uh some Turkish woman he goes to the Saudi Arabian embassy in could show geek has not been seen since October the second now this happen in Turkey is Dan both turkey it appears probable\nA Saudi Arabian citizen was killed in Istanbul, Turkey some out Trump was responsible for this they want the president to respond to\nSee the media use Julie sweating it for awhile disposed of her when\nThe allegations of gang rape and Michael ... whose father with Michael ... is doing a great job speaking for the Democratic party it'd be wonderful that guy would stay in the media for the next couple of years\nIt'd be great if he was the nominee of the Democratic party the porn lawyer fits the modern Democratic Party that guy's done a great job you take Julie sweating ache\nOr Deborah Ramirez or Christine forward haven't heard from them in a while I have you because the media is done using them to attack Trump or Stormy Daniels what's the last time you heard from her\nOr Karen McDougal in love with the president for ten years ago\nAccess Hollywood tape but Billy Bush the comments on John McCain the Khan family Kanye West Jim ... whatever it is right now it's all about Jamal could show ... somehow media want you to think the president's not responding correctly so the murder maybe of a Saudi Arabian and his damn bowl\nAs if to six or seven hundred blacks killed in Chicago every year can't be used at all by the mainstream media against Trump's they ignored or the four thousand shot they can't be used\nIn Chicago to attack the president so they ignore it but whatever the media can find some ... some club to hit the president what they're going to do it\nLet's continue with more coming up next as my interview with the president then at the top of the last to our Web Bill O'Reilly O'Reilly factor is on tonight also in about an hour or so we have\nDiamond in suburban are going to call in from the Carolinas to talk about how black women support someone like Donald Trump when the media attacks blacks who get jump out of line much like a southern slave owners would keep blacks are dumb down and illiterate that's the goal of the modern Democratic Party to keep them in line [noise]\nLet's continue thirty minutes after they are still counting undergrad American live with you [noise] every something [noise]\n[noise]\n\n... ... pounds I

read book ideas visit literacy dot Gov message from the library of Congress and the ad council [noise]\nOkay here's the deal Monday Night I got a call from the White House president would like to see you friday night when he's in Cincinnati\nOf course I wanted to go watch a high school football game with a relative playing but I thought well this is pretty important so on Wednesday I made a request that the White House to do a short interview\nWhich of the White House should said should be kept her about five minutes if it's granted I said okay actually turned out to be almost Fifteen minutes because the president and I had so much fun so I met the president in a hanger on friday evening and about an hour later he was going to go speak in ah north of Cincinnati about thirty miles north of Cincinnati and Warren County\nAnd I am a Republican gathering of which twenty thousand people show up and little Warren County while\nStanding in a field with a light rain and cold dark and the sun was down it must have been forty forty five degrees the president let 'em up\nSo well on friday night the White House said no problem I met with the president\nDid like eight Thirteen fourteen meant an interview and the references to about an hour from our relate to the what was going on in orange county and then yesterday Saturday he was in Kentucky and uh and beautiful and I think he's he told me off the\nOff the air is going to be doing this three or four nights and the next three weeks and he said I got more energy about this than I've ever had\nSo here's my talk with the president that uh was approximately seven pm on friday night tater had it\nFirst of all Mr President welcome to Cincinnati thank you you have a long distance relationship here\nI Do I have had ... ships I had swift in with my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four units are remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick ... that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there are no\nAnd knocked down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage can sure everything's on what's going to happen was making a housing development oh okay\nGood but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and er it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen\nCity must talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got them back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right now\nAbout your wife is good she's a lawyer to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well\nShe's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad\nA beautiful in one way and very Saturn or the other kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue\nTo give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just it's only a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and an South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were sick and so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to ... cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we're just trying to deal with South Korea which is fabulous as much a much improved approved deals you know improved\nI Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where so\nMany jobs and talking to my everybody talking about Canada Mexico are we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff to make a big deal if they have three hundred\nThree we got the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis a law and that might think sixty eight yeah I Know it's a good old I've got three more weeks loved three weeks and while I have\nTwenty five days and twenty five days I'm Out campaigning for many of those days I Do all of them\nBut you

the\nTonight and it's amazing plus the interview with a millennia Trump on friday night and I thought was ridiculous about our hat and a a jacket that she wore and a fashion statement she was making it's just ridiculous how the media coverage that you know media Research Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media ...\nRich of Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I I don't recall\nWith all these great things happening the media objectively covering\nThe Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody stopped me the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC or the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I I guess it's groupthink because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction\nWe're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by governor a Republican governors house the Senate spring court we are basically a moderate to right wing conservative\nWhat CBS what's safe from top to bottom or going to resolve well we're going to reflect conservative values and cover the news objectively I think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News\nAnd the ABC NBC and CNN would take an alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often with shepherd Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conduct it was a regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC\nThose ratings would double and triple and it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that\nAll you gotta do is look at Newsmax TV\nOr a one American network and you'll find conservative values in the news that reflects the American people so let's continue with calls from California

we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than Albany you saw what happened over here with all your still have building's empty will just everybody moved out I don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused\nSo we call it the U.S embassy a and its works good\nBut we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs you're talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million what you're talking about\nOf jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab to make a big deal and they have three hundred actually three hundred per se\nAnd two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent of the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least is fair and are farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries\nThey have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and onions and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "15"}
