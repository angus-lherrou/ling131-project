[noise]\n\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin ... she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it abuse should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter\nMy sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late a DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory counts\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who's spending combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied or how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from ... sure their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent\nOf the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate in other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down to Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and\nShow you where we are Steven ... of the Late Show has a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening\nAerial doom is aerial doom is as a writer on Stephen coal bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote at six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life\nUnquote you see this was never about finding the truth about professor forward she was used like a three dollar steak\nBy a Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that you wanted to keep private go she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable ... and this writer for\nThe CBS Evening show Stephen Colbert Errol Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad re ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin ... for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for the coming midterms suddenly they are walking the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized to vote than we've ever been goes to the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions are listening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero\nLindsey Graham is a hero Mitch McConnell is a hero unbelievable the losers the mainstream media peddling and lives in a relevant sees Senate Democrats demon ... demon rats and some of them call them the Senate demon rats\nAnd Michael ... who's a loser in a sense but I Want that got to continue appearing with Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon every night and put 'em on keep doing he's doing a great job\nLet's continue with more of your calls at eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up later is that same Julie gun lock the independent women's forum talking from a woman's mothers perspective and also later in life from Los Angeles they'll counting undergrad American\nSo Thursday night we're kind of ... not enough that another list of twenty five more and once they were interviewed there'd be forty more after that for a hundred more it would never stop 'cause this is all about running out the clock\nTaking control the Senate on November the six that's what it's all about it's not about fairness or determining whether or not you know Cavanaugh is a Romney slash Bush Republican he's not an Amy Coney Coney Barrett or a judge to par\nI have a sense that Kevin always going to be a conservative maybe about along the lines of an Anthony Kennedy\nBecause that's just what is your one when Susan Collins one Saturday yesterday and spent all that time at three o'clock\nRunning over his opinions and looked at me like a pretty moderate Republican while I was selected I'm not sure but once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team then the vicious lies perpetrated opponent by the Senate mother major media I got on his side completely one hundred percent\nAnd the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore nor teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done not because there is truthful information or corroborated information in fact it was shown to be false as that goes the allegations the title nine proceedings\nThat were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the facts you put a second front door and her house\nIncluding the fact that uh there were four witnesses that were corroborate her story including our best girlfriend\nOf them did everything fell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out and an affidavit to the Senate how many times that professor Ford lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times and the mainstream media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett\nA judge third power of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this adjust the judge hardness or wait for you\nAnd so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court but in a Youtube video a couple of months old she can identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping the Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen must continue were in their cause real cause some Chicago\nIndianapolis New Hampshire Nevada Delaware Wisconsin many other states coming up later in the last hour will be Julie gun lock independent women's forum and also just delete Peterson\nLive from Los Angeles in\nThe line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three sub still hunting and the great American [noise] live with you every [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nOur military service members volunteer to protect us in the most dangerous places around the world they step in when they are severely ill or injure returning to their families is only the beginning of their ... wounded warrior project provides these brave men and women whatever they need to continue their fight for independence\nAt no cost for life so\nNow it's time for a grateful nation staff I'm trying to find the W. W. P. or\nTwenty years I can do damage to rely upon Susan Collins\nAnd Lindsey Graham to be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night she was brilliant going over for forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I Try to listen and Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all\nIt seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not have listened to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of a Brett Kavanaugh as his wife his mom and dad as girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness in title nine\nThat's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl up some sexual assault the most likely did not happen they get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you could not investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version of the facts from twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapist notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for re election in two years\nBut she ought to but now a clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork to like Valerie Jarrett open gossipy famed to run against or in Maine have added\nMust continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThank bill appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party could pornography industry if you don't mind shore yeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but over the years\nOne of the largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael ever noted the porn lawyer and I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky for Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they they didn't have one criminal prosecution against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring a porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars to the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women than their leader would not be\nThe U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and twenty sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and do you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because uh you know the older the fact of the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell a if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about that second door telling me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turned out to be a lie or a misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nWhen she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth and she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a cabin all was going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys\nIn her late teens and the Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kavanaugh is because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fair but that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapists clearly indicated it could not have been bred to Kevin you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth you're not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve now for boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nViewer over the

in a world that says\nThat person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor Ford through a any rigorous process that determined voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened that how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was the ... the fearing the fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out and says she was a safe and some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute\nMaybe what I heard originally is not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door\nThat had nothing to do it cost her phobia\nThen the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying wait for little planes all over French Polynesia and ... and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America South America and the euro she had no fear of flying it was a lie\nIn fact there was nothing she said factually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we

revolution\nHere before we go to bed tonight part of the Drudge Report Michael good one who writes for New York or newspapers has a great column about the coming second civil war read that we got to run take a look let's continue\nLet's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great Billy how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller because prior maybe yeah that that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think are people like Brian who saw\nNot only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get a power number two that Democrats looks socialist progress is incapable of analyzing facts whether it be about climate change ... whether it be utilized but that Dr Ford present it in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie I Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about that second front door she lied about them for boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kevin ... in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like them his bike route\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to college hats off to Lindsey Graham about the political forces the only way that we're going to eat and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce waiting for my beating about\nGotta when you've got to vote you gotta you know Schumer said one thing Saturday that was correct you got to vote in the Denver if you take away Democratic Party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly any where does this sea of red\nFrom seat a shining city it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone and the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts\nAnd look what they did a cabin all what what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... major maker you watch that fight\nReally getting it affect you today Eric Holder whose contempt of Congress you say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of the of the Supreme Court let me see Billy for the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned bulletin\nYou have a prominent but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation all of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate process do you recall outrageous\nDo you recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media had a meltdown one Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results ed ... elections if he felt it was rigged against them and the media Hillary plant the New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought a course sailor was gonna win\nThen Trump won and up to this point Hillary in the major media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however\nThe media went after him Hillary went after him Hillary let's be clear about what are you saying and and that means he's talking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton but then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election\nShould never except at the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a Joe and New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show and New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nI could Mr Cunningham thank you for taking my call um I agree with everything that's been said prior to ... hours and your summation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important have you ever heard of Jonathan\nSimon and his book code red about a ... ... voter mushroom Freud in America yeah especially in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is a bind up him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama\nThan citizens registered in certain words and and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there was hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're a code red China concern would be an excellent for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the ... and the companies that are ... and then they only three or four for the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine as program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast\nMachine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance and the person that runs the city the Democrats in most cases\nThey're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballot for the terms who's on the ballot what have you and the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm would a\nWaiver from Republican to add to the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when I ... it was on her three hours and it was really riveting and it's been happening for a decade\nOr I Belong I Believe that and I believe in major
