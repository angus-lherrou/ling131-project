[noise]\n\nHas made an Enron this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand\nAnd every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about they Jenna mop I'm Talking about what Trump wants you to do and and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn off for them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor aboard the go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals\nFrom the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way and the Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice South American Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million\nWhat would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million when it come here and because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico to him and other words from Central America and you may go to America there was a magic\nCard that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins legal process it will take years\nAnd then meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled they have enough camps they have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago\nWith a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who not been heard yet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious if you're from Mexico here illegally you're going to take it right back immediately\nIf you're from Central America you have the right to herring that goes on and on and on and never stops so uh I I'm interested\nTo see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminal societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest there is no media\nCoverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes through New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders the rapes and cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the ... most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration federal judges and the economy right now with Trump is our leader\nIs coming up roses it's unbelievable Trump has everyone from North Korea to Russia believing\nWe're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS has destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live and maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals here was a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them\nTo the Democratic party but that's not the word I living in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan their vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the Mets\nThe one that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans\nCentral Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have where only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through ... says these we take in legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen this has fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible\nThat the most violent places on earth is sending us largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin jacks and coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education does it benefit the hospital systems that we have\nThis benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that\nWe are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come in walk into a country which you don't belong to and not a citizen of men demand rights\nThey don't like that and I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if\nWhen Trump says bad things about journalist some alley indirectly cause the death of Jamal could show gig in Turkey who now believes is crap\nIt's unbelievable but let's continue\nFlying becomes available it never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the\nThing is tonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivize rather mainstream media and the fact that ... if he was my father if he was my brother\nUh I'd be outrage at is that it was ... should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind ... give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't\nBecause the media doesn't cover it you mean Jamal could show a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us now to brave police officer who gave his life\nIs that what CNN believes the answer is yes\nThey want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump and why I have no idea\nThey must have nothing else to talk about [noise] most concern we do is go right to the [noise] one becomes available you know the routine go hunting and the great American Bar to live with you every Sunday [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n... and it's interesting I cry celebration\nHave diabetes

immigration the black community and why he was elected do by Fox News for making alleged in temperate comments about some of the women who accused Brett Kavanaugh of a bad behavior then I think it was a lie\nAt a maximum misstatement at the other side but nonetheless let's continue with your calls let's go to a fill in Connecticut an ad in Las Vegas in Philly Connecticut Welcome to the bill Cunningham show in film how are you\nOr Mr Cunningham how you connect Mr Phil I'm doing well please go ahead well here's the thing it Connecticut\nBoom and he's been off require the cabin out hearing granted I\nKnow for a fact he's working on this a caravan with a lot of other Democrats across the country\nAnd he's probably going to be down at the border in a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand I Hope I said before you know by the time spring hits the fan\nPresident Trump is already said he's not used in the reserves you use a real army and I think the plan is they want to get like another ... ... ... ... hours because our troops on the border\nThe immigrants are being told oh don't worry [laughter] door of it like a storm the Mexican border a few days ago mecca would always put in a token effort to hold the batter twenty four hours or ... the U.S ... deal with Mexico because Trump has got to Mexico archer right all these people on our border\nThe troops are going to be there they got to be colder stormed the truth\nI think there's got to be a part of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be there they're\nOh it's from the media to mediate we're this is all court\nOffended by ... you're from a Dick Blumenthal he used a war hero a state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty\nI does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking this is playing horribly for Trump where I live in Ohio\nWe don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizen to take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals coming up the most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in Connecticut has been a legal immigrant tens of thousands of southern hair thanks that Governor mulloy ... over the past year and a half\nThe Blumenthal every time the legal immigrants ISIS about the court them they hold up to her shirt\nBlumenthal shows up at church or other congresspeople from Connecticut in front of the TV cameras and they plead their case these people should be allowed to stay blah blah blah and eventually the ice a suspense their case should help her future here you can hardly see the cameras all all the\nTime to try to see the eagle illegal immigrants here in Connecticut\nAnd you know it's disgusting and remember remember here's the deal if you're from Mexico and get caught you're sent back immediately because of the law if you're from Central America and you said the magical words um arrests\nEugene and I want to hearing you get in line with a couple of million others and you never ever hearing and then you released back into American emotion can be held is fourteen days there's not we're not scaled to handle this invasion for the most violent places on earth Central American we're not able to do it\nContinuing ed in Las Vegas Nevada and ... and welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI and the U.S national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current uh conned boys or that or whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should\nFind out who's doing that also how Obama drone American citizens like this Ella we eat guy kill them all up you know trial no jury electrocution and then the media doesn't saying you know that they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and and it's because you know ... ... ... in in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club against Trump they'll do it\nBut ... out of wacky being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by not a legal immigrant or not was quickly dropped she's gone a composite or killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact\nThat ... that kind of behavior not part of the world is regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia and then when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalist\nAnd then I hear about cars show again is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why is wide more valuable than a cubs life\nNPR is that what you're subsidized by the taxpayer says the same I end up

a book about the bureaucracy the so called deep state held\nThat continues it continues today three thousand new rules and regulations a year hundreds every month it never stops is going on right now Trump's trying to stop it he's going to make the made the point of his book that I read\nThat that it cannot be stopped that there's a deep state in Washington that will continue even assuming Trump is there for eight years it will not be stopped that's his point he might Iran agree\nBut I Would agree with that completely and I I Want to tell you you know the people that protested again governor

Research Center ... well ... one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America and that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough to good\nThey only report the bad and this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time in our nation's history it conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump did an interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes\nShe interrupted him sixty five times during that interview had to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him\nFour times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad not to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they no longer in the business of reporting the news and they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night Montana friend it as mobs\nVersus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh along about a trucks that ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at Congress mean getting shot I look at the Republican congressman\nRepublican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck into side with and\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose them there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to save very recently when they're down we kick them and we kicked in the head you know the the calls to violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders he was secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life\nBecause the mob violence antifa is so out of control their goal on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created\nI think over for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences that Democrats I hate to say this\nAnd they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally it is acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper then I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ and I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure you might sell a lot of lot of his songs and records not can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick that Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on and that wrap that the the country artist would have\nHad his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her I mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult he was the president of the United states and leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second\nThat was the the converse if Donald Trump has done that with during the media would be saying oh\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production in about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\nUh I think in the Senate Republicans gained four or five seats are increasing the majority and in the house I'm going to say that it's a bold prediction the Republicans are going to hang on by two or three seats to retain the majority and keep the Trump Pence agenda moving forward\nGod Bless America Corey Lewandowski Trump campaign manager thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham showing my friend will do it again\nThank you have a great day God Bless

sits in the prison at the age of Eighteen years old and American icon\nSits in prison in his eighties over allegations that date back four or five decades meanwhile a guy who vowed then I mean you know denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI tell you it was amazing ... you had a situation where he actually raped a woman who told us that Juanita Broderick\nWhen Clinton raped her what what's a bloody lamp told her roommate what happened the roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the one eight abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House says president sexually groping and molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to go there Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard and then the bigger double than it has to do more with men ... me too movement and trying to to I Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too is a bunch of left us led truth Hollywood left these [laughter]\nOkay it's the Harvey

awards dinners and so on while enabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for decades\nDating back decades and and all the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts\nOut and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to\nA ends up being a bill ends up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy and suddenly\nA guy like cabin all they want to make him the poster child I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters\nOn summer in terms of physicians would somebody a Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters end of the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all their connections but they couldn't care less about Harvey Weinstein was a star Harvey Weinstein and access\nHarvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas\nSo they sent their own daughters end of the carrot custody in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there and a daughter that you know that you got to be concerned about cause harm it will take advantage of them but the the what the what ... rock Obama's selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy the letter is left is who will take advantage of women and every time but I could put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours that's exactly how the left stacks up I can

it's going to be insignificant to him and her but\nBecause something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down for what\nWell you know it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats\nOver the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nOr in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime the first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand that completely\nBut along the process it gives billions of dollars damage Thirteen other gang bangers to provide the passage every time he goes through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you gotta pay either sex or money so you didn't pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to get drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers to the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaign\nOr buy a Tom Styron by Bloomberg and others in order to uh to me are Republicans all over the counter and getting you know you give me over the next two weeks Yemen how's this going to play out I like to early on November the sex\nBut Democrats have missed every it's fine they no longer have their finger on the pulse of the American electorate people want our border protected so they and they also get that this is fake news that's contrived it started as a hundred and sixty people now it's up to four thousand now\nSo what time did it the right thing he said under as these people show up losing their aid Mexico I guarantee he made the same call to the new president of Mexico and say look\nIf these people get where you were going to renegotiate our trade agreements we're going to look at the age were able to send to you\nSo Mexico's deploying military on the southern border so I just heard this literally today good so Mexico's going at it Honduras I bet you will send buses the say you've got to you're going to get back to our country or else\n... and ... what the lid how's it going to play out to Democrats again overplay their hand they think that there's some issue that is going to be the guy the you know the ... the division point with Americans in Americans overwhelmingly won our borders protect that we don't want these migrating horns to think that they can just come anytime they want\nSo whether whether it's the kind you back or

Brett Kavanaugh having been\nConfirmed to the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the\nRoad the five of the five member majority would\nBe interested in raining in when he admitted to state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nAnd it gave me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS\nBut you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day made in offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers\nAnd then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nWell I think it's causing a lot of harm in the center for businesses of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very expensive for business is one of the estimates that I had in the book is that each year it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nDo that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on through all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses so\nAn important factor in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually ... uh either from businesses are on the individual each year\nThey very significant thing but it can be turned back towel and be reduced give me\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in and begin and review carefully the legislation under which all of this\nDrew are made and very frequently um rooms are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are and perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authorities if she were all these new rules and\nThe court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where um you can see that the that the agency has gone well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the digital forward it to they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations\nOf um of administrative agencies than we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time does not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government because of the best reflects the will of the people", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "22"}
