you kindly Morgan see all next week you're listening to one thousand Katie okay\n\n\n\n\nLong\n...\n\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert powers are Jewish\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert powers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first and deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people\nHe communicated with was he on friend that was ... who else knew what he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history they're Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions says I have and so this guy who\nAh hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post will not exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help it's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know was a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that stimulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know the media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt to the masses assassination of Republican members of Congress resulting in the motor wounds to Stephen ... piece\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate\nOf a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveling hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples of left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder\nTo many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice and like substance was sent to the home\nOf Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there was a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet\nAnd the media doesn't want to call those\nActions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote an word\nOne other example\nWhenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist covered the words they expressed as violence\nBut win\nLargely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all\nAnd so this is a long history of radical leftist and\nSo I'm On the right committing acts of violence that has covered it completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite set a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling Jews termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nHe was talking about those who want to keep Confederate monuments\nThose who want to keep Confederate ... mind you're much he said there's good people in that side and there's good people on the side more protesting that think the Confederate monuments out to be taken down\nBut because that charges not explosive enough the left in the media keeps saying that the president said there's good people on both sides he was not referring to the white nationalist\nHe was referring to those who wanted to keep Confederate monuments now from bill county EMS perspective I\nI don't like the idea of Confederate monuments because they declared war in my country the United states of America and killed something the range of six hundred thousand Americans by the way those Confederate who did that road Democrats they you\nKnow the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please can the media set the record straight when the president said there's good people on both sides the one son he was referring to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments on the other side were those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist caring tiki torches\nShouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers\nAnd the southern city at night carrying torches there's no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's\nWrong let's continue we'll get your goals ... coast in Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois Nevada Florida New York and California by the way the\nBoston Red Sox are bought 'em in the seventh inning of four to one [noise] so uh that's [noise] because ... is a friend of mine who plays left field for the red Sox I'm rooting for the red Sox those continuous\nMore still counting hand the great American your calls her next live with you every Sunday to [noise]\n\n\n\nA

years ago in fact what's going wrong\nIs the unemployment rate better now than it was two years ago or more people working today than two years ago is the American military stronger today than it was two years ago in fact everything it could go writes gone right\nAnd not much has gone wrong and that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces and he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not the czar\nContinue recalls will go right to go to Robert know Utah\nRobin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show rub go ahead\nThanks for taking my call Yes sir thank you\n[noise] alright well yesterday in the middle of the shooting they had Al Sharpton on\nMSNBC and anti Semitism down\nAnd then today on again off again and and friends [noise] [noise] [noise] you know\nWell I'm ... how about the riots that Al Sharpton started a New York city\nAre based upon the death of a Jewish person what about ... furniture Mart I mean it Al Sharpton is life is filled with anti Semitism any run around with Louis ...\nThat's ... and ... can I I watch cricket going a year you know I could not April [noise]\n[noise]\nWell I Know I got you know I just Google that\nDecember Thirteen Ninety Ninety five the river and Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish sooner uh Freddy's fashion martyrs or white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre newly revealed tapes show Sharpton there's not named Freddy but mentions the least dispute and colds out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton who started the massacre at Fridays\nFurniture Mart because the Jewish a small business owner moved into the black community\nAnd so I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that middle just going on and on its people for this crap\nAnd you know the guy who write to the White House and it was right and he actually got the cats are being made right\nAnd and this is you're calling from Utah and this was the guy who's now wondering indictment now this was in a large media stories that fair to say no the words maybe\nCan have an immediate story\nAnd second page\nAnd and all the white powder sent to the Trump children not much of a story and All right but I don't know just being concoction would've actually cause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb other words it was intended to cause fear\nAnd if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get white powder over your hands imposed on your lap believe me and it's a fearful terror filled event and this was a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nNobody ever and you can make rice and care for being real\nOwe them a well can you imagine a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up well you can bring up anything you know you're going to say a word\nWhy don't you know Time Warner did this to Trump well what if the parent company of Fox are sponsored a play in Central Park that depicted the murder through repeated stepping up Iraq Hussein Obama\nAll look alike saying twenty ten what would the ... number one Fox's parent company never do it but Time Warner sponsored a play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar\nWith a character looking like Trump being chopped the death toll on stage and the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night now\nWhat did the same thing that happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nA comedian who had a bomb and held his head to head\nWell Cathy Griffin now is touring the country to sold out audiences\nExplained to me Rob why the media doesn't respond\nTo these obvious\nDiscrepancies in disparities between the way they treat different acts the same actors committed it kinda depends against him it's conducted thank you for your call let's continue we

Israeli ambassador to America said that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to being anywhere in the world\nAnd so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts at the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter and no matter what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence and the American media depressed\nCNN and their allies always lecture Trump Republicans and conservatives about our anger our rhetoric and our violence\nBut one progressive explode\nWhich happens on a regular basis like stabbing Republicans setting a trucks on fire that say I support Trump sending a share is sending a rice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins\nOr the children to the president whenever that goes on at no point or progressive ever lectured by the press somehow it's twisted in turned in the Trump Republicans conservatism even when the president\nIs the only one in American history to have Jewish grandchildren\nAnd even though the murder in Pittsburgh had postings saying how much he hated Trump because Trump Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN is still twisted this thing and if something's wrong with Trump\nNever mentioning the hatred the radicalism of the left which exceeds what happens on the right the whole first in Baltimore all of the race writes the shooting a cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left\nNever any connections river made between the cop killers in Dallas\nDuring a rally a black lives matter\nAnd

wait a minute Mr Mr President how do you meet with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops\nWhat are we went dead cops when you're on them now pegs in a blanket from like bacon there's never a connection made it doesn't exist\nBut Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence takes place it's always Trump's fault Trump's rhetoric Trump's tweets the Republican Party

years of the Trump Administration will be the peaceful two years so they said the last two years are going to be a disaster\nLet's continue now with ah Joel enough Virginia Joel in Virginia Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joel how are you\nI can even bill cranky for taking my call once in a halfway you have some friends that called me earlier today from Korea and they're talking about and that's to kill them I was running as the Democratic candidate\nGovernor you know that what they're telling me is that tape and write a lot of commercials and the state of Florida and which to have and also they have been having rallies and which both Al Sharpton who you spoke of earlier as well as a lot of um um Maxine Waters and others\nHave been anticipating for the campaigning and they have been coming up in reference to a federal indictment and bobbing this to kill him and every time that comes up he keeps coming up with the race card\nI'm Wondering what your thoughts are in reference to the Florida writes\nAndrew Gillum as a socialist his background is similar to the Democratic candidate in Arizona Andrew Gillum believes in the most left wing radical viewpoint of the police department Andrew Gillum is set in the past the guy who would be the governor of Florida\nThat police departments are like occupying forces that began as slaves catchers it's the most radical governor\nFlorida would ever have now they're saying this is not the most the\nMost exciting character I Know but at least he's not Andrew Gillum at at least she wouldn't go to the same route\nOf the Bernie Sanders Maxine Waters type and he would take over Florida government and cash straight the police departments you've numerous police departments and Florida that have said they cannot support this guy because of his beliefs about the police you can't support him if he knew Gillum wins in Florida I Would be shocked\nBy the people that are called me at a ticket ... for the people that I've written up and move out of it because for telling me that the court in a state income tax\nCurrent contact talking income tax at all or wherever it may be will probably be doubled according to what their fame and apparently that's also come out in literature so it looks like he does have that kind of a massive accident in the state of Florida\nYou know Joel I'm a great supporter of police in whenever accomplish killed I always mention their names there are many cop killers are who have not been identified yet and cops are dead when you have\n... the chief executive officer of the great state of Florida who is made numerous remarks about cops being similar to slave catchers that cops are occupying forces you can't have someone like that\nCharge of police departments he's the chief executive

have seven hundred thousand illegal showing up in the southern border the great majority are given due process hearing are the three to five years from now and will never take place it is they melt down on the southern border with diseases and what skills we don't need with individuals who are illegal\nAnd the Democratic party is shift completely in twenty oh six Obama voted for a border fence has\nThat Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer what twelve years ago the Democratic party won a border fence is to be belt\nThey wanted illegals out of the country when they started losing elections they figure it out well let's make Texas\nA blue state let's flood taxes with illegals make them legal to vote and then we can win Texas ... wins taxes and that guy is a fool in a clown over Ted Cruz

W. dot org and welcome home number ...\nPhone use heard here every day news radio one thousand Katie okay [noise]\n\nHighly counting others continue with the tragedies the tragedies is weak and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas rescue and former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations whether it's an attempt to mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today or has been along the lines that uh this Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy\nThe NBC News this morning head on a neighbor lived next door to him a\nHeavy set a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas Redskin former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again to the bill Cunningham shown Thomas how are you\nA very tough situation awful um but when I watch some of the morning\nAnd afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all and I hid menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish\nAnd ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless uh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon\nIt today did ugly reporting saying that uh\nThat are in fact Sarah Sanders put out something a\nFew hours ago just said is there any tragedy the Washington Post war not exploit to attack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such an honor public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some I've said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI seen\nYou know there's always twenty twenty especially in the law enforcement or the investigative world when I Can't believe [laughter] no one else was on his tweets his social media is other things that he was hosting couldn't have alerted only\nWhat the what is your mom think say something [laughter]\nKnow someone had this scene and could've alerted the police the police if we find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or to look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him\nWe can criticized the police but until that time\nPolice and law enforcement agencies and even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was one in her call FBI numerous people had called about an Eighteen year old up punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school and even though call in or an FBI people call it in that wasn't following up on even if those things happen there's no perfection\nThere's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nNo perfection on horse but you're only as good as shifts today and wish I could go on for shipping is very easy to do after the same law enforcement is tough on so I Know from my experience with the NYPD\nWe always look back we always did that review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case in the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm short in Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media\nSomebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating and and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individual sadly in the country like ... hours waiting for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOf like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against ah against Jews\nAnd against African Americans there were several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you were in NYPD or you go right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nWhat did he do when did he do it who didn't send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media accounts three fifty seven magnificent some blocks that were legally purchased and they are Fifteen they're still tracking that thing down and see what it is\nYes I totally agree and take what you said even further this president has a son in law who is the orthodox and a very religious Jewish guy he has a daughter who converted to Judaism and as you said his grandchildren or Jewish\nSo you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what it said it's a matter of how we're saying and it's a matter of law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments to there and the gray right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a ... guy goes into Times Square one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater\nIn New York City on me a bunch of years ago and thank God he had failed terrorism school\nAnd couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but they're on knots like this around the country is what keeps law enforcement people up at night\nWorrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talking to someone the guy who is sort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood\nWho is capable of grabbing his guns and go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas ... former NPD NYPD officer thanks for coming in the bill ... show and all of us need to lower the rhetoric just a little bit

on with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and\nAnd the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in this article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now yeah well into Mexico what the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal in Oregon a stunt by political agitator is an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden\nSeven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together at one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened\nWhat the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the major media won't do it\nWell you know Bill thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigrant to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt a competing country and once again we have here\nWhere we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a according to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states who has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people\nSome of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a\nGang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to say oh this is you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing tents are suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not something that just happened on its\nOwn nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime you know I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the wind and the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explained why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place the same time with precision began marching together along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water and ... all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate\nUh caravans that have formed the largest one that we are talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that has an even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies and so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift\nUh not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTo a Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance\nBecause it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden the bomb
