you could not walk down the street or reading city without being searched by every soldier that you encounter that was part of the problem\nAnd so we cannot be driving down the street and just get randomly searched without probable cause and without a warrant it very clear in the Fourth Amendment\nI think it's very clear as well but I also think I mean we're not talking about riding your bike

STAR One thousand this half hour the master's program brought to buy new castle casino where real gamers comes into play\nWhich meant now you've got a wing it now you have literally got to make up a new process and it was chaos to try to figure out what's the right process what's the right way to uh to be able to handle this and it really drug a lot of people through a very very painful process\nUh Brett Kavanaugh are obviously Dr Ford who\nI Believe was used in this process all the aggregate public she came out and said I never wanted to come public I take her at her word at that uh we could have done it privately but she was told by her attorneys that she had to go publicly when we had over and over again said if you want to be private we could do that FBI checks can be done privately\nOr none of that was given to her as an offer they pushed her to have to do it publicly and put her in the country in a really bad spot\nAny chance Dianne Feinstein faces ethics ...\nFind out at ... at the end of the day we've got to figure out who leaked this out to the media there were only three groups that had that letter from Dr Ford or her attorneys or a congressman or issue who is her\nU.S House representative in California and Dianne Feinstein in her staff okay it was one of those three leaked it out to the media they got out there and then they pushed Dr Ford out in the public eye where she did not want to be\nOr there's enough plausible deniability there with all three of those people you mentioned\nYeah well at some point they're going to find out like for instance uh all of the ... thing that happened or were members of the Judiciary Committee and the Republicans their home address their home phone number is where they lived in Washington DC all they got put out on the Internet and they found out he was a staffer\nUh for one of the Democrats in the house or Sheila Jackson Lee one of her interns that actually gotten the book from somebody in the Senate and put that out they were able to track it back down hold that person to account they were fired and pushed out they're\nGoing to be not allowed to be able to work in the house in the Senate I get that it's entirely reasonable so there'll be able to track it back at some point if they choose to be able to do it\nThere was a lot of conversation about what Sheila Jackson Lee was handing to one of Dr Ford's lawyer's\nYeah we really don't know at that point of what that really was but we do know one of her staffers was handing out on the Internet\nThe address of Republican members of the Senate and got repeated over and over again I mean there were there were members not just of the Judiciary Committee other Republicans during that time period that individuals were posting their home address their phone numbers are saying there in Washington DC now their family is home alone here's their home number\nHere's their senior adult parents here's where they live right here their adult children where they live I mean he was brutal I just think the these are folks trying to be able to intimidate and when people said it was like a mob mentality it really was people trying to bully and intimidate people to try to be able to not go through the facts\nBut say you will submit to our will and that's really what it became at the end of it rather than a a reasonable look at the facts that were drawn to deal with\nSenator James Lankford with us on his radio one thousand Katie okay and the course of this conversation do are you open to taking phone kosher I Am a ... nice to be home to be able to talk to everybody you word today a view viewing or something's going to be very important to our economy in Oklahoma\nSo I was actually went up to the new Amazon facility uh that's one that's just been added it's going to speed up the delivery quite frankly uh for individuals that order from Amazon to be able to have that they're doing deliveries within a forty mile radius around Oklahoma City so it's very important Oklahoma City and folks that order online\nUh obviously I'm One that encourages people to just use their choices by from local folks I think it's a great gift to be able to engage with your neighbors on that\nBut if you want to be able to buy online if you're getting it through Amazon your and get a lot faster and now with this new facility they're adding four hundred and fifty jobs are so that facility plus a lot of small businesses because people don't know the way they do do delivery is they hire local contractors to be able to do delivery\nUs sometimes or Amazon packages going to come and just a car and then somebody who works for them as a contractor comes into his delivery sometimes it'll come at a big fancy van that against some small business actually run so wanted to be able to see that operation as the the innovative ways they're handling it\nSenator James Lankford a news radio in thousand Katie okay and it's up it's up and running right now are there just about it is\nIt is up and running Steve Russell and I both went up there today to be able to see who's been open for about a month they're still hiring they're still putting on a lot of structure of it but uh yeah it's up\nAnd running 'cause I thought I saw one of the Amazon vans in my neighborhood this past weekend silence on is that still and\nThen the entirely likely it's it's up and running so you'll see that it will be very distinct\nGary's joining us in Mustang on news radio on thousand Katie okay Gary you have a question for senator James Lankford\nA yeah it's a
