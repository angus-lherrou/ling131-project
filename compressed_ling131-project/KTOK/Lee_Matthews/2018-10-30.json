Am Calvin Katie okay new center the mayor of the town of ...\nShell make or enforce any law we shall a bridge the privileges or immunities of the citizens of the United states nor shall any state the prime any person of life liberty or property without due process of law\nNor deny to any person within the jurisdiction the equal protection of laws\nSo\nI think what that means is is that\nAnd and the reason that the president is thinking about issuing an executive orders because of the the what they call the anchor baby concept people illegally getting into the United states having a baby here in the United states and then claiming well my baby is now a citizen\nAnd I think an argument can be made but an argument could also be may well you are not following due process\nYou are not following due process of naturalized and yourself as an American citizen first I'm not a lawyer I'm not a constitutional scholar but that's what that says to me when I read it and maybe\nThe president's executive order will get the courts to look a little more strictly at how many cases I Believe the fourteenth amendment being abused see them as been holding a news radio in thousand Katie okay to chime in on this thank you for doing that\nWe normally how you doing good sir\nAlright a better understanding of the intent on the fourteenth amendment a and the legislation that was half later in a twenty three Nineteen twenty\nThree that is ... uh extended citizenship to American Indians to provide proof that the Congress has a constitutional power to define who is within the jurisdiction of the United states and he calls they're\nSo today we believe that anyone born within the geographic limits the United states is automatically subject to his jurisdiction but that's renders that jurisdiction clause useless okay\nSo that's the key point Lee is that they are under the jurisdiction of the United states\nSo ... that American Indians were born in the United states native born\nMhm but because they didn't wear allegiance to the United states and or the constitution they were not the jurisdiction okay once they get so that made\nThem liable through all the government grants and uh the that come with it but it also made them eligible for the draft mhm or over it made them citizen to where they can vote\nThat was my point yeah yeah\nNow you've got to do with process as well but uh in order for them to have a definition of citizenship\n... was a all\nPersons born or naturalized yes\nOkay that's the that's one part but if you gloss over that subject\nTo the jurisdiction part that's the key element if they're aliens illegal or otherwise we're not subject to the jurisdiction because there is there sworn allegiance is or citizenship is to another country\nSo as long as I so so making sure I understand where you're coming from Steve in are you saying that those who are illegally coming into the United states I'm having their anchor babies and then claiming that they're anchor babies are citizens that this allows that or are you saying it does not\nBecause of do does not OK clue that\nBecause they are not citizen that's how a okay\nAll you had a he was born\nRight you believe it or not he was born in Hawaii [laughter] yeah\nTo an American mother ... before he was a citizen of the United states natural born or whether he gave us the actual a copy of the birth certificate or not that remain some conjecture but\nYeah and I I've always I'm not I'm not I'm not gotten into that argument at all thinking well okay you know that's that's the that's the same thing as\nAs a ... and you know what that's I think that's why we're seeing this Russian collusion I think what what we're seeing is the same group of people back yeah yeah and the same group of people said well you were always after the birth certificate we're always going to go after this collusion thing\nThere's no they're they're\nThey're right right right and I didn't think there was any there and they were the birth certificate but that's just me but I understand what you're saying Steve and yes I was stationed\nIn Hawaii and some of the guys there that were they saying no that's not the right one\n[laughter]\nBecause they had a Hawaiian birth certificates [laughter] it ... it looked like yeah yeah so I heard that the\nFlag and I'm like okay well you know better than I Do I'm a a Florida kid\nYeah here in Hawaii So I don't know well so let me ask you this then it what do you think the president if he issues an executive order would that do any good\nYes it's going to bring the uh item to the attention of the national public and explain to the people how the fourteenth amendment\nIs supposed to work ... versus how it has been interpreted in the past yes yes\nSo when there's a proper illumination maybe they'll get it but of course you're going to have the forty percent\nThat's the hard core left it right the matter whether he and his cancer they are going to be mad 'cause he didn't do it yeah\nWell this is what they've been using to say that the Republicans are breaking up families in that none no such thing as had been happening nobody is breaking up any family that hasn't voluntarily broken itself up\nOr if people have been deported they've been allowed to bring their children with them at no point did they said oh no you you can't bring your baby hears you're brave ... the ban is never never happened and never will so a lot lately [laughter] like a\nThing is is that they're not telling them is he was just continuing the Obama policy yeah if you walked it'll ruin ate a bad law you enforce it and force Congress to change it\nYeah well in the end or Oregon the courts to to to strictly define it and I I think that's\nThat's what may happen here a Steven thank you for the input on new trendy one thousand Katie okay we're gonna move on now to Michael Bauer who is with twenty four seven news in our news division I by heart media yet another package has been found Michael this one I went to a reporter and see an end\nAnd uh have we been able to trace it back this one went back to ... or whatever his name is\nAt this point the FBI remaining mom on that fact but they did say that it looked similar to others mailed last week a prominent Democrats as well as the time Warner center in New York and boy the same markings it boy the same stamps as all the others that was addressed to CNN with the rest of the networks headquarters CNN Center\nAnd according to reports their belief is is that it falls in line with everything else that saves her ... has sent\nOver the past week or so now or what they didn't say was what was inside that package they said that all of the elements of that package have been set off the Quantico for investigation and that's kind of where we are at this point but it is believed based upon the fact that they said that it had the same marking that they believe this may fifteenth package sent from the bomber last week\nOkay so it makes a total of Fifteen and a ... you will one ... is one is I'm expected to believe that it probably win in the mail before he was
