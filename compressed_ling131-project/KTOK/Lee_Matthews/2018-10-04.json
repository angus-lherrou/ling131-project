what they're trying to do Marcus creates a perception that uh he's against all these things are also trying to heighten the perception that he's anti teacher\nAnd they're hoping that most of the

but what again Democrat negative ads right off the bat that's their that's the way\nBut anyway and all yeah\nWell thank you for hanging on mark and in all fairness a I don't know that it's the

you hear somebody talking up talking which means everything's a question\nHow are you doing today are you doing okay that's up talking when someone is up talking it usually means they're uncertain about what they're saying\nAnd that's where the question comes from there I you know they're they're looking for your um [noise] uh they're looking for you to verify what they're saying how you doing today are you doing OK today oh I don't know why I'm so raining so hard\nAnd I thought that maybe I Would go and see the movies\nNow the fry zone thing um is a habit that comes from I think not wanting to be clearly understood because you're uncertain about what you're saying and you don't want really for someone to understand what you're saying\nWell this doctor employed both and I noticed that to him I noticed that right away now I noticed the up talking before I noticed the fried towns but here's what I did find out later and uh I haven't Googled this to to prove it but I'll look for it and maybe I can use it on the air tomorrow on the show thank you all for coming by\nVery nice to meet you um the um the doctor Dr Ford her actual speech pattern is worse than what you heard in her testimony\nIt is really annoying and I would sit through a class of hers just completely annoyed it'd be fingernails on the chalk board because Israeli\nAnd I ...\nI mean she really I'm not trying to mock her [noise] but I Can't ... from what I have seen she was coached so she would sound less like a Thirteen year old last like on a talker last like she talks with price home\nI tend to believe that she talks to the way she talks because and people who do this because they're on certain about what they're saying and I'm One of the things when I when I first met Dana Perino a one of the things she told me there's that's one of her big annoyances\nAnd then when she talks to college girls especially she said don't get in that habit you sound idiotic you sound on certain used you will not be taken seriously and I think we saw that with a doctor\nI also think that what the what the Republicans that are very good job of was\nSticking with the facts they didn't let her voice annoy them she they didn't let her up talking makers sounded like she was credible\nOr a little girl being ... they just stuck with the facts and so did that prosecutor was asking the questions I noticed that and now we're seeing what that grand strategy was with Republicans they were making it impossible\nFor Democrats to come back and say but you were means or her but you didn't take her seriously but you didn't stick to the facts\nBecause they did on all those accounts\nThat was a very good observation I noticed that too and I mentioned it but I hadn't revisited it and I thank you for reminding me of a day for all the thousands Darwin thousand Patty has been hanging on I thank you for hanging on\nAnd joining me this afternoon on who's ready when thousands Katie okay\nYeah I got to forehead ... attack that\nWay yeah um yeah\nI was curious as to why they're\nGetting on an terror when he went down on them that you had one hand on her lap and I was going all over her body she went to arm to halt the heck I'm into not part of your face and nobody talked about I don't understand why yeah\nYeah I I I think the prosecutor who was asking the questions was trying to get enough factual information out of her to let her discredit herself I I think that she didn't go there and I think a lot of them didn't go there because that would have put the blame back on to\nThe victim and they did not want to be guilty of blaming the victim is\nI really think that that you know Patti I think they were fully aware that they were on camera\nYeah oh yeah yeah no I agree\nIt's the talk anyway I mean the ban can eat he pushed ironic chicken scratch ate everything ... among them at a video on them pay that so I don't know anyway that's my opinion [noise]\nWell thank you for hanging on to that on his radio in thousand Casey okay we're going to check in with ah Michael power here and just a little bit to see what the latest is and from what I understand the Republicans have now put this into overdrive\nThey're going to fast track this so fast Democrats are not going to know whether they've been powder burnt or snake bit by Sunday because it's going to happen so fast but we'll get into that with Michael ... who is our connection in Washington DC was twenty four seven\nNews Davis on news radio in thousand Casey okay thank you for hanging on\nWhat's going on up okay that may be that CBD Oil is really good stuff is\nActually incredible one of the few things that I've ever tried that works for the things that you're talking about but that's not what I called to say here's my point you're a lot smarter than I Am done and\nI Need your opinion on that you know the inability of people to put themselves in other people's shoes is incredible you know of all the things that bug me about this deal probably one of the biggest is the fact that these Democrats from a live or to Chuck Schumer to\nUh the book or any any of them are talking about that\nAnd this is where I Want you to give me an answer they get on there and they say you know this guy judge Kavanaugh just aggressive he's he's he's mean spirited he's he's he's just a to this and to that when he was up on the stand he was just\nYou know such a row you just we're row you just couldn't control and self up there and\nYou know the guys up there fighting for his live on on on kind of nations that are complete lies that we get a lot of people feel like and he's trying to protect his his family is\nEverything that he's worked for for the last thirty five years on on accusations that were made thirty five years ago and he's been a model model guy than um than the staple really believe\nThat they would act the same way if they were in his shoes if somebody was doing when they were doing to and they would just get up there just with us do it you know completely neutral tone and just answered questions without showing any um ocean\nAm I wrong there\nWell here's a ... let me let me explain day first of all ... and I'll use Cory Booker as an example Cory Booker is the senator from New Jersey he's uh\nHe he's very flowery whenever he's in front of a camera he filibusters whenever he talks about anything which means he just goes on and on and on saying the same thing over and over again and he like Dianne Feinstein like many uh even some Republicans\nAre like this to they know that when the cameras on and the microphones rolling that their constituency is watching them and they're always\nPlaying to that constituency they don't care vats they're breaking the golden rule of do unto others they don't care that they're they're taking everything you and\nI learned in Sunday school and they're throwing it out the window they don't care about that at all all they care about is making sure that their constituency back home is watching them and going yeah you go big fella\nSo that they will continue to be elected to that office\nAnd the reason is but it's what it's what Christ himself warned us about to me I Believe when you get into that frame of mind you are in essence giving yourself over to many of the evils in our world\nYeah great aunt way I'm going to hang up and listen to the ... are you\nTaking my call okay I'll talk ... ... what's your day\nAnd it's very difficult for us to as people walking around with our mid western sensibilities it's very difficult for us to\nUnderstand what it must be like to live in that world how can you be one person one minute and then one person the next I've heard Cory Booker attends the a congressional Bible study every week that they have\nUm Jim Inhofe our own senator says they have a Bible study every week and Cory bookers there is he not reading the Bible it says do unto others as he's not as not considering the feelings of ... it has no problem concealing Dr forwards or a he has no problem considering Dr forged feelings what about\nYou know it does it why can't eat well and this is exactly why\nThe reason he can't is because he's playing to his base back in New Jersey most of them are Democrats most of them are union most of them\nAre are are not for this nomination and so he's playing into their hands and it's it is playing a role in many many ways I when I started my career ran into this a lot of times a lot of radio guys are like that they're one person on the air and then when the Microsoft they're completely different person\nI Can't I don't have that much energy I Can't live my life like that and I can't a fake it\nAh I just can't do it and that kind of swings back to what Tim was or complimenting they on earlier in the show about how I let the says you let people answer the question you let people talk well Tim I don't learn anything if I'm doing all the talking\nAnd I genuinely especially when I have a ... a politician on I Want to know what they think I'm not going to a I'm not going to a wink or ambush people uh because that way people shut down\nAnd when you're having a conversation with someone you don't learn anything if you're doing all the talking so that's why I that's why and thank you for the compliment but that's why I when I talk to people that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to learn something and I enjoy talking to people so that I can learn something\nSix flu signatures to move forward on that procedural vote for the culture and then if it passes that's when you get to your debate on the bill domination of thirty hours right the limit of the thirty our time frame\nSo it would seem to me that there are any question leading up to that about this investigation they could be addressed but it seems as though Mitch McConnell is definitely believing incompetent and the fact that he's got these votes\nYeah I think it's starting to backfire but
