there is no voting on line there is no voting on line in Oklahoma\nSo maybe in some states I Know in some states like Colorado they have mail in voting and the people love it but it has also slow down the process somewhat so\nAh and then there's a scam going around where they called you and basically tell you the same thing so watch out for that uh\nOh and later on I wanted to get into this remember when\nThe department of health first got control of the medical marijuana issue and there was some questionable things going on certain favors being granted and that they were trying to get rid of smoke a bulls but then they ...\nWell it turns out it was exactly what I thought there was backroom deals going on with this whole thing\nAnd I'll tell you what I've learned today coming up on his radio one thousand Katie okay April and down some star were overly Matthew programs brought to buy new castle casino where real gamers come to play got a pair of tickets to the upcoming concerts to uh\nMelinda do little she is the American idol star from Tulsa concert coming up a twelve and Thirteen to Pacific center and you'll get to go if you're my corner of the day on his radio on thousand K team okay Tim is in Oklahoma City Hi\n\nGo ahead I got it on the other day or the M hours like liquor stores that hurt her on that day and night and they have\nThey still have to close on Sunday and they still have to close at nine PM [noise]\nLocation can ... while they're close\nThey can yes okay\nSo you'll still be able to buy beer and wine from the grocery stores as long as the grocery stores are open\n[laughter] yeah I didn't know if they were but if they released their hours where they could say the same I Do have a sales or not or\nOkay yeah yeah [laughter] sounds good okay\nNow I don't know about the overnight joins ...\nYeah they still have this through the moratorium on the overnight sales have here that's reason why nine PM they're not going to be able to sell new liquor stores right but the convenience stores in the grocery stores I Believe it's one am okay where's it gives the cut off\nThere's like four or five hour period overnight that they can't sell or any alcohol products at all\nOkay and that makes sense there was all up in this fine years\nThat's fine you know what and if they had opened it up and made it a liquor stores can sell beer and wine on Sundays um you know to me that would have been a good solution to\nAs long as it was six point cold the fact that we couldn't sell six point beer cold was nonsense and I know when it all went back to it all went back to the state's definition of what liquor was\nAnd the idea was okay we're only gonna sell liquor and liquor stores and liquor was defined as anything above three percent per volume\nAnd the reason that definition stock was because\nAnd this is sexist as\nAs all get out well what if women want to have a beer oh okay well when\nWomen can have the three too and that's what we'll set that three two percent level that that that is not liquor and so that's why it was able to be sold and convenience stores in grocery stores but it was three to and here's my big beef with that a six pack of three to beer cost as much as\nA six pack of six point beer in another state now do you know how they make three ... three do they just cut it with water that's all they do\nIs kind of when they take the regular sixth corps three to be here is nothing more than the same stuff that comes out of the brewery\nWhen they're making regular beer and they cut it three two percent with water\nIt tasted diluted because it was\nGoing to play and that was my beef wait a minute I'm not going to pay the same amount of money for Warner then I'd be paying for here I'm getting less products are the same money that was my big beef and somebody was still making all the money and the state was still making all the tax\nThat was to me the biggest ridiculous news of this whole this whole mall\nOne fact I heard as we're leading up to this last week was Budweiser strong Budweiser they only sent one product Oklahoma you stretch for years that was her platinum and liquor stores where one of the biggest markets for Budweiser planting them and then they ... yes I bet we were we were\nA Berlin thousands Darwin downs on the news or anyone thousand Katie OK moving on to Michael Ballmer who joins us now from Washington DC and he is with our twenty four seven news team that is our\nUm our news division of heart media I'm Michael ... we've been hearing a lot of rumors has the Senate decided when they're going to vote on the cabinet issue at all I think\nAt this point everything is in pencil right now so there's not any definitive anything in fact that even shifting over to use the ... this week was supposed to be the meeting between Rod Rosenstein and President Trump now that can be pushed back even further everything seems to be ... on the FBI investigation that the president has signed off and it was called for\nBy Jeff Flake at the end of last week and this is sort of developed if you like that he said she said and testimony last week when you're going to love what's going on right now it's kind of the they said we said in regards to the FBI investigation where President Trump has promised the FBI free rein in its probe but the New York times report it Saturday\nAt the White House has asked the FBI to question only four witnesses and and limit the probe on that level so\nThen you have Dianne Feinstein writing the White House saying uh provide the Senate Judiciary committee with a copy of the written directive you sent to the FBI and the White House going\n... there is no written directive we sent the FBI any an old parameters for this ... came from you guys at the Senate\nAnd so now we're in this they said we said element of things but we do know\nThat the investigation has been gone we do know that at least in regards to what we're hearing so far Deborah Martinez she's being referred to as accuser number two the one who says that Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to hurt\nHas been interviewed by the FBI now we don't know what was said in that interview we haven't heard the details we don't know if that's all but we do know that Julie sweat Nick meanwhile the third woman at least at this point isn't plan on being interviewed by the FBI it all whatsoever and that\nAt this point Kavanaugh and Dr for both have not been interviewed by the FBI\nNow the witnesses to choose not to be interviewed I mean that's the Fifth Amendment right great they do not have to be interviewed\nCorrect and since this isn't a criminal case that's certainly the subpoena power could come if they needed to be on some level\nFrom the Senate Judiciary committee but at this point there is no subpoena power because it says in the criminal case on any level you have to be I could go and ask questions\nThey could be some of the shortest answer that you ever seen if everybody said no we could have the investigation done by today but there are elements of this what we know that there's another guy today that's come out so that he was a classmate of Brett Kavanaugh the Yale and that Kavanaugh was not only a frequent drinker and a heavy drinker but also\nWould get aggressive and belligerent during the time that he did drink and has a sworn testimony that he's dropping off at an FBI office today indicating that at least on one occasion Kavanaugh is what started a fight that ended up with another friend that there's going to jail so\nHe's submitting that the FBI filed which if you're following protocols that would be admitted into judge Kavanaugh's\nPersonal file through the FBI now whether that gets any further investigation we don't know there's only a week to conduct this investigation as\nWell and I don't have a problem with that I mean they were the the centers were very clear when they made this proposal limited in time and scope a one week and they kept talking one week which from by my calculations is friday correct the other friend\nOf a cab and all that a ... mile to say on friday um my judge who is a in rehab but uh did I understand correctly he said he was going to cooperate with authorities but that um the the charges that are leveled against cabinet are bizarre he sent bizarre might judge said\nYeah that was that was his report for this as well and I think that that he's kind of been that guy since the get go here\nHe didn't ever\nYou know he kind of was one of those guys were ... we had this college lifestyle things went on and this happened but he never really got into detail about anything kind of stayed away from it at this point now he's willing to sit down and discuss things\nWith the FBI here you might get some better information and it sounds like he's at least open to that portion of things\nBut it does seem like what what he has to say because this is the person that Ford Dr Ford said was in the room at that time it would seem to be\nThrough some of these other allegation that we've heard from people somebody that would be a bit of a comrade to to judge a cabin on some level hanging out with regularity and you saw according to his calendar that they were hanging out with regularity that this would be somebody that would have\nSome insight into all of these charges again I think what we're looking at is one of two things they're either looking for Kavanaugh to have lied or they're looking for Dr Ford to like the ... then you throw her credibility out the window as we've already heard\nFrom a the prosecutor that was there at that hearing she doesn't feel like there's even a case if she were prosecuting this case on any kind of a case she would not prosecute against Kavanaugh that said if Kavanaugh allies and we've heard from Senator Jeff Flake than that may take his nomination off the table for just lying to the Judiciary Committee so\nIt looks like right now as soon as they can\nSee some information that would indicate ally one way or the other you might have a shorter end to this investigation\nYeah yeah and that seems to be the tactic being taken by the left right now is that okay uh we can't just we can't add any more credibility to the case let's say and I've seen a lot of this over the weekend um this\nBoard members later rescinded their initial emergency rules and unanimously adopted the pared down set of rules August one what you remember and I said to myself that I said you huh that doesn't that that just doesn't smell fresh first you were going to get rid of all smoke ... and now you're not\nAll of those rules by the way will remain in effect until lawmakers take action which is not going to be to the legislative session so they're still could
