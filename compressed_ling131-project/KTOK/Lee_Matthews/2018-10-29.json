Thomas's or to give it to the legislature because Walmart does not want your lasik surgery\nIn these new our church and [noise] yup Tom matures alarmed to find out that a ...\nState which is not a quote medical doctor and um that that's my opinion that that's really what harm the language in in the same question and I am I Am for it I'm going to vote yes [noise]\nWell Robert you know I I Love the um the some of the rhetoric that I'm hearing against it but as as trying to make it said well you shouldn't let\nWalmart write laws will know Walmart not writing any laws they are behind this because they want to be able to sell glasses in their locations and\nThis is one of the few states where they can't do that so they're not riding laws they are getting behind laws that are important to them and to their business and that is the American way so I don't have a problem with Wal Mart a lobbying if you will for certain measures\nEverybody does my business does I bet your business Robert does to whether you're aware of it or not so that makes sense\nUm as far as I'm Thomas ... doing lasik I didn't know that myself\nBut ah it makes sense that Wal Mart does not want them to be able to do it in their facilities because they don't want the liability\nAnd that's what top demolish justice Ming a opticians an optometrist would be a would be absurd absolve I Would be would be causing if they did such things in a Walmart so\nI think all in all it's better for consumers to have that choice and to have that competition news radio in thousand cagey okay\nThis is a black market minutes today's trading answered questions about whether Wall Street's worst is over stock started the session with games and gave them all up and then some down bouncing higher first by more than three hundred points\nThen ending lower my almost two hundred fifty the Dow fell two hundred and forty five and has that one hundred Seventeen the S. and P. Seventeen\nAmazon and Netflix led tech shares lower but once sources told Bloomberg to us is getting a new wave of ... set for all Chinese imports if talks between President Trump\nAnd China's president don't these trade tensions things started looking more like a route IBM is at a tough time trying to reposition itself as a clown company so it's buying me open source software company red hats\nThe deals worth thirty three billion dollars it sent red hat shares soaring by almost half their value IBM's drops four percent an analyst says it indicates IBM isn't as far along in the cloud is it has suggested I'm Joan ... Bloomberg Radio news radio one\nWhy FM's Ninety six we\nIn Birmingham dad was\nFinishing up his meal he and his sons were leaving bad guy decides to force his way and at that point pulls out a gun and start shooting at people that had a gun on him quickly dispatched the situation\nSo while we were hearing how tragic one shooting incident ended we're also learning what can be done if someone who knows what they're doing and has their gun I don't care if it's on a McDonald's or in a synagogue but\nThat is the best way that is the best way to save lives\nI Know there's a lot of people why would anybody want a gun and church why don't you ask that white supremacist why don't you ask that job that shot up that church in South Carolina why don't you ask that other not job down in South Texas that were shooting up a church I Would gather\nThe first reason you're going to hear is because they knew that was nobody in there with a gun that couldn't dispatch\nThem it was getting free zone\nSee how free they are\nNow it sounds a lot like I Am blaming the victims here I'm not\nI'm just saying we as a country need to change our attitudes about guns April in thousands STAR One thousand Gretchen there's armed with Lee Mathews\nI think I heard\nThat question that the I stand in the eye doctor going into Wal Mart or there but I have never been you know and I got it that we made it work for them I Am from I can and what\nOkay well good for you maybe I Need to change our doctors 'cause mine was like oh no this is where you're going to get your to your glasses oh really [laughter]\nYou're not required that well a few that hasn't made\nA four when thousands STAR One thousand a news radio one thousand Katie okay we'd always got um we've got the more statistics that have come down from the federation for American immigration reform a\nThese are the guys who invited me up the Washington DC last month and um you know they are doing a lot of good work\nAnd they want to make sure that immigration stays on the forefront and that reform of immigration stays on the forefront so they wanted to make sure that I told you some of these statistics [noise]\nWe all heard that ... ... migrants are on their way to our border well there's another group of Honduran migrants around Fifteen hundred that over the weekend\nThrough a Guatemalan police cordon at the border with Mexico\nAs the primary caravan continues northward\nThis has kept the issue in the headlines as the nation approaches one of the most important mid term elections\nAs the nation first learned with the Mariel boatlift of Nineteen eighty governments can weaponize migrants streams and attempts to destabilize or embarrass a neighbor like the United states\nThe Mariel boatlift allowed Cuban President Fidel Castro to attempt a to empty his jails and mental institutions and send them all to the United states [noise]\nAnd there are five documented and important facts to know about the current caravan\nNumber one according to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez the caravan as being funded in part\nBy the Venezuelan dictatorship number two the caravan contains gang members and people with significant criminal histories including deportees according to the department of homeland security\nNumber three the caravan currently estimated to be seven thousand strong is not an isolated incident there's already a second one forming in Guatemala and the third one in El Salvador\nThat started northward yesterday [noise] number four men and caravan participants by their own admission our economic migrants they're trying to get a better job and they were well for not qualify\nFor asylum in the United states we only grant political asylum\nBut because of loopholes in our asylum laws that Congress has failed to fix twice they will likely be admitted or given asylum\nAnd then disappear into the interior of the country by the way not a single Democrat voted for either bill with the native Simon and then that's finally number five and this was from our good friends at the federation for American immigration\nSeveral thousand care of and members were offered asylum and they comprehensive benefits package that included health care and jobs\nIn Mexico\nBut most turned it down many are not fleeing their lives of persecution back home they're simply heading to the U.S for better paying jobs\nNow\nWhat the facts and figures don't deal with is who is funding all this because\nIf you did the math\nThe average person can walk a maximum of twenty five miles a day and and if they started in Guatemala\nIt would take them what Seventy eighty days to get to the United states border and that's going to be way after the election but somehow they're already in Mexico city and still heading north\nAnd every time I see pictures I see them being loaded up on trucks\nSo who's paying for that\nWhose feeding them who's clothing them who's giving them shelter someone said well they've got the cell phones and that they can connect with different people who are going to provide all of these services okay who's banned the cell phone bill\nI don't know about you if you ever gone overseas with your cell phone\nIf you don't take it off and put it on airline you're going to these shade charged all kinds of wiping expensive uh roaming fees so you can't just simply go from Honduras Guatemala tuned to Mexico and bring your cell phone and expect to pay the same bill\nAnd if these people are so destitute what are they doing with a cell phone\nAnd I fell in it that\nSo those are my questions and generally when you see those questions the answer is somebody somebody's paying for it\nNow I've also heard words that while there's Catholic charities helping them out okay [noise]\nUh they're not the only ones\nI can see where an organization like Catholic charities will be okay yeah we need to make sure these people are taken care of in spite of whatever their political or their political policy is or whatever they're they're in game is I can see that\nBut can they handle all seven thousand\nI had a hard enough time trying to get them to distribute a relief supplies that were coming in during the twenty Thirteen tornado [noise]\nYeah they can handle some but can they handle all of it that's my question\nNo offense I'm not trying to slam Catholic charities I'm trying to set up the point the Catholic charities isn't the only one somebody else is now some say also George Soros people well George Soros gives a lot of money to a lot of different groups and a lot of them are left leaning and he doesn't care [noise]\nGeorge Soros is a lefty\nSo I don't think it's all George Soros would it be somebody from a communist a government like on his way law or even the Castro ... s ... maybe but I'm skeptical about that Venezuela barely has enough to feed its own people and its own ruling class\nLet alone finance a a bunch of a ... a bunch of migrants [noise]\nIn another country Honduras [noise]\nNow would they be trying to do that to undermine the election that's a possibility [noise]\nBut the best in game I Would think it would be to okay let's send a lot of ... let's flood the border with migrants so that the migrants currently in the United states will stand up and vote against Republicans\nAnd I think that's gonna backfire because all the migrants that I talked to who are here legally and have the right to vote did it the right way and they don't want to let somebody get ahead on line ... ... a head of the line\nOr or or skipped wine [noise]\nSo a lot of unanswered questions still\nBut there's the facts as I Know them from the sources that I have in Washington DC\nWe'll talk a little more about this coming up and also get an update on the shooting in the synagogue and Pittsburgh which was horrible\nUh we also know a little bit more about the guy who was sending these goofy bombs I say goofy bombs thank God they didn't go off but every time I read a description of one of them it sounds like they never were intended to go off or at least we're not a capable of going off the way that\nThey were set up live at CBD plus USA I Am le mans he was in a Guthrie I'd love to see you here CBD plus and CBD plus usa passionate about their products and they want it to be affordable to you and that's why they have these location set up all over Oklahoma City and\nTo two of the other bombs that were mailed out so they're saying they feel pretty solid and understanding that this guy is the guy who mailed these bombs out he's going to have his day in court today as well\nAnd then I also saw story that he had worked as an exotic dancer in Oklahoma all bleed\nSeems to me it was weird because they said that he had worked in some exotic dancing bars on some level with a DJ or a bouncer at different points and then it sort of seem to develop a new well he was actually a dancer on some sort of chip 'n' Dale\nAsked kind of dance or a ... like that just as a a level of not only kind of gross and possibly even too much baby oil to the store\nAnd a man okay mental picture here and he's really went down
