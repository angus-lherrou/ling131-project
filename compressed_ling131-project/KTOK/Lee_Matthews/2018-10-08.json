few minutes ago right before the news\nAnd she was talking about the confirmation process over the weekend first thing she mentioned was how disruptive some people were in the gallery [noise] if you've not been to our United States Capitol there is a gallery kind of a balcony where the general public can go in as long as you're quiet\nAnd if you're not quiet the Capitol police will remove you\nNow to get into that gallery you have to especially if it's on a weekend wait in line up very long time\nAnd they don't let just anybody in so these people that were going into this gallery to disrupt this vote or all professional protesters and what they do is they start lining up overnight outside the Capitol building\nAnd they are paid I Want to say Fifteen dollars a day maybe maybe Fifteen dollars an hour I don't know when I was in Washington DC\nThe building where the confirmation hearings were started was right across the street not only from the Capitol building but also from the Senate office building where James Lankford offices and I was going to visit James Lankford and I saw all these people lined up I also saw\nPeople walking down the line of people with a manila envelope full of cash and they were taking these people's money out and giving it to him and these weren't the protesters these were just the line holders the protesters were going to go and get their part in line that's been held for them by the paid professional\nUh to get into and tried to disrupt the hearing well they do in the same thing uh for the confirmation vote and that's why that's why

they're they're willing\nTo sacrifice at all I guess now on the other side I'm very proud of Republicans and how they've handled themselves through this whole thing and maintain themselves with this

Republican senators Democrat senators\nNot all of them but a lot of them have had to get where they are by promising a lot of things that they couldn't fulfill how do you promise\nThings you can't fulfilling continually get people to vote\nFor you you make sure they feel good you make sure they feel good so they'll forget what you didn't do for them\nThe biggest example of that is Cory Booker he's the senator from New Jersey he is so condescending and rehearsed in everything he says and does and I think I've had this conversation with you before the reason he's like that is because he's playing bass in his state\nHe was voted into office by a lot of people who live very close together\nAnd are very unhappy and he has got to make sure they understand that he cares about them which is why if you ever see Cory Booker give a speech he sounds like he's reading in nursery rhyme\nHe's doing this because he wants even the youngest person who can barely talk and read to understand he's caring about them\nNow I look at it and I ... and then I come across\nSenators like Senator Langford senator Langford would never do that because it's just not in his nature senator Langford will tell you the truth even if you don't want to hear it\nAnd I think that's one of the problems with Republicans they're willing to tell you the truth even though you don't want to hear it and in an election year that doesn't get your votes\nNow when I Would like to see and what I've been asking for out of the Republican Party over the last several years that they need to be more brutal and the report in their approach and I think they were uh especially with getting this through\nBecause this is what the American people want out of the Republican Party they don't want them to be nearly mouth milk toast okay if you say so they want people to lead not follow and if you let\nThe loud mouth in the room have enough time being the loud mouth and the room they everybody will follow them because of the only ones doing the talking\nNow getting back to senator lying for one of the things I learned about senator Langford when I visited him in his office he genuinely considers this job\nBeing senator of Oklahoma or for Oklahoma in the national a scene he considers that part of his obligation to serve\nYou walk into the senator's office and you see reminders of service everywhere\nOne of the more powerful reminders of service is that you'll see this thing with him over and over and over again it's the foot washing do you remember the story of Christ washing his disciples feet\nIt was an act of humble today it was an act of of laws and it was an act of service and so that's a recurring theme that you'll see through ... and I remember I remember\nGoing through his office and they were showing me all these wonderful pieces of art and and and showing me how much he loves Oklahoma and when he goes into his office that's only wants to think about as Oklahoma but he also only wants to think of service he considers himself a servant of those who sent them\nSent him there [noise] not every senator thinks that a lot\nOf senators did end to that Senate office and they are dazzled by all of the show business and the national exposure and the reporters always wanting to talk to them and they all of a sudden just start thinking that they really do make a difference there really have the power\nAnd they forget that they were put there by the people of their state to serve them not to come to send it to them not to try to talk them into things they don't want to serve\nAs one of the things I've learned and that's one of the big differences between some of the senators that we see granted there are plenty of Republicans who do get up there on the bully pulpit and think they're full of it and there are plenty of those who condescend\nI'm starting to wonder about flake [noise]\nYou know 'cause that's what he did come descended\nIf only if his principles April in thousand start one thousand another news over the weekend I started seeing is halfway through the game on on social media I started seeing calls for my students to be fired [noise]\nAnd at first I thought it was [noise] [noise]\nI saw [noise] the first half of the game I was watching I thought okay they'll be so brutal I mean Texas has a pretty good office and then towards the end of the game I was like yeah we\nGot to do something because oh you couldn't make a tackle for anything\nWell I mean one day afterwards or he was fired as defensive coordinator he was let go after his defense surrendered five hundred one yards I didn't know was that much twenty seven first downs yeah that that\nHe uh it was early announced earlier today a rough\nAnd the meal is going to be at least the interim defensive coordinator and you know what I bet a what I bet the coach will do I think coach Lincoln Riley we'll see how he does next couple of games and then decide whether or not he gets the job permanently or not\nI also think that when uh my ... got back to his house it was a moving\nVan waiting for him that's how quick they wanted to get rid of them I Wonder what point did a Lincoln Riley decide yeah\nYeah he's got to go [laughter] that's he's gotta go [laughter]\nI Wonder if there was there was some communication at some point maybe at half time did Lincoln Riley pull students asides that dude ...\n[laughter] oh okay well you've got another half to get it done but you better get it done and they didn't get it done so it really is a step I'm Wondering okay\nStat was over ... you know more about this than I Do you use defense red zone which is when they when the opposing team gets you know the twenty yards ... Golan\nUnstoppable\nAnd that that caused him to lie on some level well they're saying that that's a basis for impeachment again a very big stretch for something yeah is going to happen a month from now in your hopes but there's nothing that indicates that you're going to get people to the polls to do that right now\nAnd it would also signal I think if the Democrats didn't pursue it a clear part is some payback for a confirming a capital a\nMichael ... thank you for joining us on who's ready one thousand Katie okay live it's seen any plus USA back in the studio ...
