now have a have to be more careful or just eat more\nWell Frank no offense\nI still take three to beer for me it was a waste of money I never liked the idea of spinning the same amount of money on

and public affairs that's at OPEC the modernization\nOf Obama's beer laws was delivered in vintage fashion with Budweiser Clydesdale arriving on the capital this past Monday\nState question seven Ninety two brings with it many changes to the states alcohol industry including allowing liquor stores to sell refrigerated beer and allowing grocery stores in gas stations to sell beer with more than three two percent alcohol by volume\nWhile many Oklahomans we'll be celebrating the change it's an important question to ask how much of the price of cold beer goes\nTo the state coffers\nAccording to the beer Institute taxes are the single most expensive ingredient in beer cost more than the labor and the raw materials combined\nThe Tax Foundation is perused a map that allows you to look at how beer taxes are in each state a coma come Obama comes in fifteenth in the nation with forty cents per gallon of beer and excise tax added to the price of the beer\nThis is the highest rate among our regional neighbors like Arkansas and right behind which right behind Oklahoma thirty four cents per gallon Missouri rounds out the bottom and only six cents per gallon why why buy beer in Missouri\nOr some other states to take note Texas only twenty cents\nPer gallon Kansas Eighteen and as we said Missouri six cents a gallon so we're number Fifteen and the top fifty states with Missouri and forty nights a thank you Jacqueline that is interesting I did not know that [noise] but uh this notion that\nRaul or do three true bears the same amount of alcohol as the as the as the six percent it's just

different formula\nYes I realize that and if I'm misled or misspoke I refute that\nWhat I was trying to demonstrate is that there is an argument\nThat when you see one that is on the top of the can that says a this was mixed by volume and one that this was mixed by weight that doesn't mean six point beer is the same as three too and that's what I was being told by a listener yesterday what was the same thing no they're not\n... they're not the same thing but you know that's a common misconception though is is six point beer yes because you know\nThe the Oklahoma law the new law is a model\nVery much after the what's been the law in Texas for what at anything and taxes that was considered\nFear has to be less than four percent yeah far away yeah which is five percent by volume yes those six six ... six point here is is a misnomer\nBut if you will [noise] yeah um now you could you can get beers as high you know it's now in Oklahoma and Texas for the longest time you could get beer that's higher than five percent by ball you you just you couldn't get a cold beer yeah\nWell what you and yeah but you but it's still it's still five years in which the easy calculation is wait is eighty percent of all you've well they'll still for it depends\nOn the brand of the beer and I'm not going to sit here and get into the differences between okay this brand history too but this ...

tickets for you to the upcoming Melinda do little show we are now being joined by a libertarian candidate Chris Powell who is joining us all news radio one thousand Katie okay he's\nIt'll be on the ballot along with drew Edmondson and a Kevin stats Chris why don't you go ahead and just give us what you are what your platform for the governorship would be\nWell as a libertarian I'm for all of the rights of all the people all the time uh specifically for the governor's race we've been talking a lot about education about the idea that we need to get the control away from\nTwenty third and Lincoln and back down to the local districts within reach of parents and teachers are parents teachers and students are who are involved in the education process and that's need is who needs to have the decision making power\nNot a bunch of politicians at the Capitol we also need to pursue criminal justice reform we have the highest incarceration rate in the nation\nAnd that's unacceptable are both on moral and\nFinancial grounds so we need to really pursue meaningful criminal justice reform so that we can um work on fixing that and stop putting people into the prison system that shouldn't be there and the first place\nSo that they have an opportunity to be a to continue to be productive citizens are both for themselves and for the rest of us we put people in the prison system and they come out a lot more dangerous than when they went in and\nThat's not helping anybody so we need to pursue them and then we also need to work on our state budget overall we had hundreds of millions of dollars in\nCorporate welfare and uh money that's going to special interests we have state agencies that are mismanaged and pull of waste a because we've had a governor who's been asleep at the switch the past eight years\nSo we need to address both of those things so that we can fund core services will have those services delivered well [noise] uh and that way we can do things with uh the things that we need to do that the people at the state expect\nTheir state government to do without having to consider things like a tax increases things like that\nOf course Powell libertarian candidate for governor he will be on the ballot in November the a six on who's ready one thousand Katie okay Chris how ... how ... you hear the Libertarian Party in more states than it it doesn't seem to be as prominent here in Oklahoma why don't you think that is\nWell I think it's a actually really more well\nKnown or than it is in some other states you know you love it or Gary\nJohnson's uh a result in two thousand sixteen uh we were I think the fourth highest percentage for him in the nation or the so the we ... we're\nWe're doing a little bit better now it you know there is the problem that we have not been on the ballot for a bit for two thousand sixteen the last time we were on the ballot was two thousand because the the laws\nThat prevented us keep getting on the ... or some of the worst of the nation a slight her\nYeah one thing I Do have to credit the legislature for is that they did change those laws and now we're able to participate and run candidates so ah yeah we're here we just haven't been before the people on election day now we are and now we're we've got this opportunity to ah really build\nOn the libertarian mind set of Oklahoma of\nYou know personal responsibility and uh you know go from there to really build a party that's going to be a permanent part of the political landscape pair\nOf course Powell candidate for governor and he's on the tip of the libertarian a ticket and will be on the ballot or Chris working people learn more about you and about your platform\nOr they can go to ... for governor dot com or there's a lot of information there are obviously a you know if you do\nA Google Search of a ... for governor in Oklahoma then you can find all kinds of things where uh I've been on the in the media and a newspapers TV that kinda thing so you know there's a lot out there to find on also on Facebook now for governor\nA and on Twitter or so there's you know those kinds of things are out there for people to find if I Want to look for\nIf I may Chris Powell because I've been hosting this program now for going on ten years and are there especially in the last six eight months there've been some really hot issues that have bubbled to the surface that I think we're concerning the people of Oklahoma and if I may just to get your opinion on these issues maybe one of the time are you up for that absolutely\nWe are certainly had a big issue a recently with teacher pay\nAnd uh I think related to that is um how the school system is ah how ... we have so many districts in one of the things that I talk about\nIs a until we when we find a way to conglomerate some of these districts I Know they're going to have a solution so what is your take on teacher pay and making the education system better\nWell obviously I I think we've had an issue with our teachers not being paid adequately they certainly think so I think most of the state agrees with that that are teachers have not been sufficiently well pay\nBut if we think that money is the only thing that's going to solve this problem that's that's wrong or you look at a survey of them are teachers that is a the department of education has non ... every year it was done back in January it's failed on her website you might have to\nSearch for it but two thirds of those teachers those former teacher said it would take more than money to get them back in the classroom\nAnd that's a you know really what that is is their ability to control the classroom there or the lack of respect for what they do and the abilities and education that they have\nAn of course you know if you're in a bad work situation that you're not happy with your work environment the easiest thing to do is ask for re but what we really need to do is in power these teachers to run their own classrooms you know you look back at how spilled ten Seventeen and there's all these so called reforms\nOr some of those like climate size as a you know keeping class sizes low we've we've gone away from that over the years but the two things that are stuck are the state designing curriculum and mandating testing\nWell nobody at twenty third Lincoln knows your child the teacher in that classroom knows your child and it's going to know a lot better\nHow to go about testing whether they're learning the material designing the materials so it's going to be better a table for them to absorb it\nUh those kind of things we need to trust our teachers and that's going to go a long way to fix things ah you know as far as a teacher pay specifically we have our teacher pay schedule and that what that does essentially that creates a wage for\nA no other almost no other state does it this way states all around us don't do it this way and they all more pay more than we do or because they leave it up to the districts and that that makes the districts have to pay the market rate rather than saying oh the state says this is what we pay\nSo until we trust our districts until we trust our local teachers to make these decisions were going to continue to have the same kind of problems that we have now\nIts course Powell libertarian candidate for governor on these ready one thousand Katie okay big issue this past spring was constitutional carry voted in by the legislature vetoed by the current governor your stance on constitutional carry\nI Would have signed it and as governor I Will call on the legislature to send it back to make a a right to bear arms a what I think is really a legal code of case you know the basic human right to self defense is a right and we need to recognize that here in the state of Oklahoma\nOr another big hot issue as legalization of not medical marijuana since that passed but recreational marijuana where do you and the Libertarian Party stands on them\nIt's MORNING Blount was among three suspects who were caught were stolen items a week ago in more police they managed to get out in the back of a police car there and we came to the attention of

from Washington DC Michael I'm Wondering if Democrats are still\nHappy about their decision to extend the FBI investigation I mean they did I understand Dr Ford stories now starting to develop a some holes in it\nYeah we're hearing some reports that Chuck Grassley has gotten a a a note from somebody who used to date\nA Christine of lousy Ford and his indicating a couple of different poles if you will and her testimony saying that a while he was dating her and I believe the story so that was about six years or so uh that while he was dating or there was never a second door in the studio apartment that she rented\nThat she never mention anything about if you're flying whatsoever and that for all intents and purposes never brought up any sort of abuse\nOr sexual or otherwise she may have suffered from a in the entire time that they were dating now that person has remained anonymous has not signed their name to anything but Chuck Grassley kind of bringing that up to highlight to everybody that there may be some questions about her testimony in front of the Supreme Court\nOr that in front of this record for the uh the Senate as well so whether or not that plays out and we see any names or if that's even investigated by the FBI could right now the FBI seems to be getting relatively close to wrapping things up it could\nBe wrapped up the investigation today or possibly even tomorrow which sets right on pace for what Mitch McConnell wants this Friday vote\nAnd deed and so Mitch McConnell very well may get his friday though\nHe might ... if anything if there's a delay for some reason and depending on how you know this investigation goes away all the how fluid this can be\nBut the way that it's an unpaid if things were to wrap up the day they get twenty four hours the senators due to kind of go over everything you could see a friday vote on some level if there's a delay in that and they need a little bit longer to go through things that you might see it happen on Saturday on some level but it was sure seem as though heading into the weekend Mitch McConnell may be getting the vote that he's looking for\nI bet at least a cloture vote now here's my question I mean he's got to leave the culture open for a while but can they turn right around like if they were to vote for cloture on friday turn right around on Saturday or even Sunday and come and vote for confirmation\nYeah that could very well happen they could have that confirmation vote come Saturday it would seem as though they probably wanted to leave that a little bit maybe pushed it through to Monday so that may be the start of the week you're looking at that but it could is it possible absolutely\nNow again I'm Wondering if any minds have been changed I'm I'm of the mind that the yeah the mind that a flake is there's already been peeled off and he coming back but what about the other two Republicans that were on the fence\nWell we hadn't heard much from either other than this they're steadfast rule that they were waiting to see what was going to happen with the FBI investigation so we're expecting that that's part of it we did see a earlier this morning Senator Susan Collins reacting to what President Trump did last night in his alleged mocking uh Christine Blasey Ford and how she called that\nA a warrant and how she felt that this was not something that she wanted to be part of when asked about her vote she didn't respond anything so I think it's for senators Collins and Murkowski this is going to be a situation\nWhere between President Trump mocking and then whether or not they have to go into if there is a complete FBI investigation and there's question about that right now but if they get the information that they're looking for and they go down and they sit down and vote for judge Kavanaugh going back to their female constituents and trying to explain how they support it something that President Trump ... as well as judge Kavanaugh\nCould be tough for them so unless there's something in that FBI evidence that really kind of highlights\nEither hum the endorsement of judge Kavanaugh or perhaps questions about Christine Blasey Ford I don't know how they're going to vote at this point and then you still got those two red state Democrats that nobody's really sure of either but if you get Murkowski and Collins to back off with like that's going to be a big problem\nI Would say so I I Would say so now uh as far as um I mean the new senators and not being asked if\nIf the president mocked anybody who's being they're being asked is this man qualified given the evidence to be the Supreme Court justice in the FBI has not come up with a reason for them for it for him not to be the FBI justice I Would think that would be the decision\nYeah that that sounds absolutely right but I think they have more that they feel that they're going to have to answer for going back to their constituents that we've got the part of it absolutely that's a part of it and they could very well defend I think probably pretty well whatever they get an FBI information they could probably defend their decision to vote and judge Kavanaugh but\nThere's more political element as we've seen with oh yeah but the politics\nOn this is insane so um and when we listen we're seeing questions again today from both ah Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez their law themes saying that the bureau has not done a really good job of either\nFollowing up pursuing important leads are even talking to Christine Blasey Ford she's not been interviewed at this point the witnesses that they have said could very well substantiate her allegations\nThey've not been in contact with and you're looking at the FBI possibly wrapping this thing up so there may be some concerns for the senators as well when they take a look at the FBI information if they don't think this was a complete at case if there's not a follow up interview on some level of ... I don't know that they're going to see this as they completed FBI investigation\nWell that's true but the way I was asked to make completed the investigation they were asked to do a limited scope and time investigation so\nIf I were Republicans that's what I Would go back and see I I you know and I think I think the barometer here for a Democrat running out of arguments is how flowery bookers um um the testimony becomes every time I see him in front of the camera is getting more and more flowery in\nHis speech I typically true I can see a correlation there we won't know for certain but I feel like we will be able to go back and map out that correlation clearly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Lee Matthews", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "03"}
