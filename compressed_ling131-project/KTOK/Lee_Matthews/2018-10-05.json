along\nAbsolutely we're a ... but you know we're thirty days away right now and ah so it's going to be a she'll be a close race we need all of our supporters getting out to a vote November six\nAnd that is it do you remember six I think I saw some statistics that ah since they update of the election boards system to be able to allow people to register online uh there's some somewhere around two point one million registered voters in the state now\nYeah I think that's probably about right\nYeah well a Kevin I wanted to ask you first of all you know the teachers pay was such a big issue back in April and may what do you have any plans for teachers in Oklahoma\nYeah so you know first off we've got to pay teachers what market is market to me is what they're doing in Texas Kansas Arkansas kind of the states around us\nSo the legislature actually moved our teachers now we're number two in the region\nAnd that is fantastic because we've got to be able to recruit a more teachers to our state we have a lot of emergency certified teachers\nAnd I've actually got a plan to move our teachers to number one in the region such super important uh but also we've gotta we've got to focus on class sizes\nUm we've got to focus on really getting the outcome of the kids getting our kids ready for the workforce so when I talk about funding education it's it's also common had which is K. through twelve minutes career tax and it's higher ed I'm actually getting all three of those to work together\nAnd focus on getting our kids ready for the workforce whatever their career is\nDoes that plan because this is something I talk about quite a bit does that plan include any any look into consolidation of school districts you know that that\nIs a local county decision do you have to ... we have to have a kind of look at our funding formula and tweak that and uh but uh but again the local school districts local counties have to decide how they're going to drive dollars into the classroom become more efficient or in in in those things so\nThink when you look at the funding formula or it'll automatically ah ah encourage different administration fishing sees but that's up to me it's a local county decision\nKevin ... with us candidate forgot\nAre all news radio in thousand Katie okay with Lee Matthews another big issue that uh was important to the listeners a particularly my listeners cause I'm such a gun enthusiast an activist is constitutional Kerry where is your stance on constitutional carry because of the current governor vetoed it so\nWell I'll just tell you this ah I Believe in the second amendment and uh I've told people that I was signed the constitutional law or carry bill if it hit my desk there's there's something like a twenty other states that have very similar laws to our state Vermont New Hampshire Kansas Missouri\nUh so uh I don't think you as a constitutional conservative I don't think you can pick and choose what parts of the constitution you're going to uphold and so I'm absolutely a strong Second Amendment supporter\nAnd uh I Believe that the best defense for a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun\nAnd Kevin ... joined us here ah news radio in the house and Katie okay uh and eh he's in continuing his gubernatorial campaign which led the latest polls I see look pretty good\nYeah we've got all the momentum a couple of a public polls that first or after the after the runoff they had me up to\nAnd then we saw one me up for and the latest one that just came out today at me up six and because people are tired of career politicians or I'm going against the guy that has been in politics for the last fifty years in Oklahoma and his family's been involved in his brother is on the state Supreme Court and and people are tired of more of the same\nThey are looking for a business person and outside or not a politician a fresh set of eyes to come look and run state government and state government is a twenty billion dollar a revenue business and we have to deliver better services\nAnd and that's why I think I Am the right guy to leave because we have got to have accountability and transparency in our state government I'm going to do that as your governor\nI noticed a one of the issues also that was being talked about a lot or in the governor's race in through the last legislative session and speaking of accountability is audits it seems like there's a lot of an automatic audits that are no longer being done your thoughts on that\nYeah I mean absolutely we're going to audit every single agency but we're also going to put performance metrics and place I'm asking for the forty to appoint the different agency heads to really create accountability and have a meetings twice a month with those agency had so we're delivering better performance and we're talking about\nThe performance indicators performance metrics that's what other states are doing and and that's what I get excited about is we don't have any different issues in our state than they have in any other state in the country that's why I think we can be a top ten state and that's my vision for Oklahoma is for us to be top ten in job growth\nTops in in education top ten and infrastructure and I've got a plan to get us there\nKevin ... with us I gather you have a Web page where people can see more about these planes\nYeah a ... for governor dot com and we're going to be a role in our education plan on Monday and or go sign up and uh uh get involved there you can look at our infrastructure and our efficiencies in our growth plans as well\nYour opponent or seems to be trying to pigeon hole you with the current administration I don't know how because you've never you've never been in office before so yes there how that's going to stick Oklahomans\nAre too smart for that I'm not I'm not a merry foul and I'm not Brad Henry I'm not a career politician I've never ran for office never been in office before um you know\nI'm a fresh set of eyes on the state problems and that's what people are looking for my opponent has been in politics his entire career started in the seventies and a Oklahomans just don't want more of the same and that that's why that's why we're gonna win this thing in November and we're gonna we're going to turn our state around 'cause Oklahoma's turnaround starts right here right now\nI Hope you

Maine by the way who if you really want an example of a rhino she kind of is it because there's a lot of things that Republicans as a party stand for that she did not\nI think she was a voter for

now mansion is with West Virginia\nHe is a very conservative Democrat but he's also being challenged by an even more conservative Republican in his district and he is up for re election on November ...\nSo\nI don't know if you remember but it was a couple of days ago I said I predict mansions gonna cave and he's going to vote for capital which can be one the one Democrat who does\nBecause number one he's from a very conservative state West Virginia number two is being challenged by an ultra conservative and number three that ultra conservative is can easily say hey ... has been he has been on Fox and every other a news outlet that would have him on saying yeah I'd vote for capital I vote for cabinet\n\nSo it basically means that it is a lock\nI don't remember his name but the there is an unusual situation that the voters supposed to happen thirty hours after they open for debate and they open for debate at ten o'clock eastern\nSo thirty hours is what it meant brown four o'clock our time but yeah around four o'clock tomorrow is the earliest they can begin to have the vote\nNow\nI haven't heard about what what the result of this would but does a senator in Montana whose daughter's
