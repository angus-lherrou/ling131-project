situation what good would that have done me\nSo uh let me caution people that are if you're using a gun that you're not familiar with that you don't use all the time I'm a revolver man not a semi automatic\nAnd uh you know the sure that you know how to make this thing work when you need to I have now changed around my house to go through a revolver which are very familiar with and the new revolver are safe to have a I live around under the firing a under the ...\nBut you have six rounds and leave me I think six round or\nWell I Am wanted to ask you about that because I have\nAn orange ... a semi automatic pistol which I think was developed by the Germans when they found browning pistols lying around on the battlefield of World War one because it's almost identical to browning technology was the safety a handle safety where you squeeze the handling it clicks the safety off\nNo ah this type of safety that are operated by the right sum\nIt up on the slide and you move is down in order to activate the or the gun to be able to fire but for some reason you know I just stood there and looked at it and I went gosh you know of course you're always keeping it safe direction and one thing the other but you got a loaded firearm\nAnd all of a sudden you draw the line as to how to make the same work that's not a good idea\nYeah no I I agree I agree a lot and see the reason I asked about that safety is my little ... I usually carrying around quite a bit but I keep the safety off because I Know in a defensive situation I'm not going to remember\nPoll aim oh by the way you squeeze the handles or your turn the safety of a I just leave it off anyway so I was ready to go back\nAbout the people who wants to keep firearms safety major make sure that you don't have to operate the firearm and if you're not real familiar with semi automatic go to a revolver revolver works fine you pull the trigger it goes by saying\nWell it's also good advice to rotate like you just describe because I'm I'm Bad about that I I
