the data is kept for ever and shared with every agency that wants it I Know the DEA is interested in the movement of cars across the country thanks and that's from ...\nFrom what I understand many none of the data is allowed to be kept or sold to anybody it can only be used by uh the state police who are trying to determine who is and who is not\nInsured properly and all they want to do is send out citations to those who are not insured\nBut they are trying to scare people into getting their insurance now it's not as much of a problem I think here in Oklahoma as it is in other states because our registration process is a lot more strict\nBut I Lived in other states where all you had to do it you didn't have to have a current insurance card you shouldn't have been in charge card see a State Farm okay you're insured cool I mean they didn't check\nThe dates and Oklahoma is far more far more a\nThorough with it so on the one hand yeah I have no problem with the state police doing what they have to do to make sure people are insured properly I have\nUm a little uneasy with the state police being able to pull us over for no reason but unfortunately because of our license laws having no insurance is a reason\nAnd there is no violation of your private property because they're not looking inside the vehicle and they do it to just scanning your license plate checking the registration and if the insurance is current and they leave\nYou alone so\nI don't see any constitutional violation here either\nBut if you want to continue the conversation ... thousand start one thousand ... says I'm all for the proposal of checking license plates for insurance coverage coverage however I Do not understand why tribal plates will be or will not be checked is this a matter of the technology

and we would have\nI'm In and get a policy and they they would want to just ride it for thirty days right how am I couldn't do it because that particular insurance I can not didn't write already they policy when and I don't know all the the work and that would come back and they know what they would cancel it\nYeah just long enough to get their tag and whatever and you know it it's a problem oh yeah um\nBut here's the thing with these these license tag scanners well what if they catch you with no insurance they first of all send you a fine and then it gets you off the list so you're not find it again you have to sign a promise that you'll go and get at least a two year policy so you can't go back and just get a thirty day policy and let them do that\nI wrote the state legislator of like my state legislator like years ago and I never got her on about that this man I met with same ideas that are trying to implement now and it would be fairly beneficial if we just\nTake our tax from one

I was on a in a road and war and was ... by uninsured driver and almost died yeah and unfortunately the police officer\nOr I don't know the person was never sided for lack of insurance they had an insurance card and they failed to pay their insurance and I'm not sure police officers hopefully their database especially with a new system\nAllows them to see if they have a vehicle has her insurance versus insurance at the time of\nThe early registration right\nRight and I'm not sure what what goes on as far as Oklahoma is concerned I Know many states as long as you have that card they didn't care they just wanted to see that you had the card they didn't check to see if it was current\nThey didn't check to see if it was a thirty day policy a lot of times the little an indicator didn't say that it was a promise there was a lot of small insurance companies making a lot of money\nThirty they policies and when they would give the person paying for the proof of insurance he didn't have a date on it so they could show it I mean it was a scam a scam from the beginning\nApril in thousands STAR One thousand a news radio in thousand Katie okay uh Justin rights when driving without insurance under current law law enforcement can do two things\nOffered discretion they can impound the vehicle or they can seize the plate and issue a temporary played that is a yellow encounter which gives them ten days temporary insurance by state that cost us fifty dollars per day they also can get a citation\nOr fail to pay the citation then their license get suspended and the tags are turned into the sheriff where the person must appear and pay the fees to retrieve the plate\nIf not the played his return to the state of Oklahoma tax commission and just and I gather that that is the same\nProcess if uh it got that deep\nSearching the database using the license plate scanner for instance\nThe cops not pulling over the person or the offender is scanning the license tag somewhere somehow and ah your popped in the database 'cause you don't have current insurance you're sided turnout have current current insurance you don't pay the citation or make the two year promise\nThen your name goes up on on another wall and the next time you're pulled over that just popped and then you are impounded and so on just like you described so I I think that's the whole process\nClint is in Oklahoma City on his radio in thousand Katie okay Hi\nHello yeah go ahead I was\nI was just calling to ask you why you think it's going to be November that or it's going to be the only think it'll be a full day schedule or a scheduled to five like they did with CBD recently\nProbably a scheduled to five probably a scheduled to five making it a supplement\nOkay yeah\nBut but here's why I think it would be like November that that they would do this because uh I don't I I ... well okay I'll put it this way\nTrump may not do that he may just go ahead and do it because I'd be actually a pretty popular across the country and it probably won't hurt his administration\nBut generally when politicians want to make a decision and they don't want anybody paying attention to that decision they do it when nobody's paying attention they do it on like the friday before Memorial Day or the friday before Labor Day or a fourth of July or the next big holiday coming up would be Thanksgiving that's why I think that\nOkay so I was just wondering where that was coming from I was thinking that\nUh it would've been better after especially you know after Oklahoma voted in seven eight eight it would've been better for an executive or something like that to happen before the election because we're all paying attention five hundred something thousand of this so voted yes\nOr a ... of all of us here in Oklahoma definitely plant all of us here in Oklahoma but if he's going to take a marijuana off the schedule one list I think he would be worried that certain legislate tours in other states would be hurt by that by association with him Republicans\nBut Republicans aren't going to change their mind just the marijuana but they but the Democrats will change are not Democrats I'm a registered Democrat but uh-huh ah I'd vote libertarian so I wouldn't be changing from Democrat or libertarian to that 'cause\nThey have here in Oklahoma because of the oil industry and our ability to have a pipeline now from Canada down to the Gulf of Mexico through Cushing is an example\nSo\nUh you know that's ... ... of here in Oklahoma now is that what's going on in ...\nIn North Dakota I don't know all politics is local especially mid term elections and that's what the mid term that's what the ah the media seems to have forgotten if there is a blue wave it isn't anything that the Democrats are doing it in anything to the Republicans are doing is what's going on in each and every one of those districts\nApril ... thousand STAR One thousand a news radio in thousand Katie

I Would think it would be in the realm of possibility and it's something that will have to be considered by the investigators as they\nTry to figure out the or the origin of these devices and I think they should be able to make progress on that rather quickly uh but right now they're looking at all possibilities when you when you look at the number the the people that are received these packages\nOkay all of a people critical of the president all the all the president has also been critical of so you're saying okay this could just be a right wing individual or group following the rhetoric of the president\nBut could also be a left wing individual or group trying to put the cross hairs on the Republican Party or it could be someone like a foreign entity just wanting to cause mayhem and disrupt the mid term elections\n... thanks for the update from New York on his radio one thousand Katie Okay Mark isn't had been real quick high there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Lee Matthews", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "25"}
