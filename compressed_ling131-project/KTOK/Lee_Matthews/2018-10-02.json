like four basic historical reasons Oklahoma has at least electrical or has more logical ... number one\nIs the topography your notice or western Oklahoma we have lots of square miles a sexual lives issue Oklahoma bark I got to go around those mountains in those\nAll the water so that that's a big factor yeah second factor is the low road dressed as Norman, Oklahoma I discovered this with our ... year reckless news that ... that you've got this certain shape for the town and there was a different light well that's because many citizen\nOklahoma my hometown of late go was one for the railroad was that's the sound again however if the road was on a certain angle so smart or came all your letter figure we've got to hurt each west north south so there's a twist that that's what happened to Norman another incidents as to why it's\nThere is a simple timing eastern United States\nIt turns out like the joys Connecticut Pennsylvania is cetera that was developed so many ah actually centuries before hours\nThey started off as India past trails and then became a a couple of roads and the time they started making a ... mile road and I even ... ... dollar they already had a direction going so that was it finally went to the brilliance of Dwight Eisenhower\nWho saw the economic and military efficiency of the Audubon it came back started interstate highway system personally I think that's the number one determinant as to why we became strong national economic ... our system where we have to have roads you kind of mixed up with those those are for reasons other than our organizational brightest electric Oklahoma\nBut art out for where they have a structural on the road I at least by my way home so that by character short history lessons are friends you\nKnow a James I love stuff this is the stop I Love because of the same thing has occurred to me and James I lived on the east coast for a brief\nPattern and the only thing I Would amend to what you're saying about east coast towns is that they did spring up not only along Indian paths\nBut they also sprung up a along rivers and tidal flats and the Atlantic ocean so they had really no room to grow out or if they did grow up they had to be very creative about how they grew which is why there's such congestion in Washington ... ...\nWell one one what are you still there I Am okay one short historical a thought if you will um and I've spent first here to the American people lost their to make an honest living ah yeah but I watched\nWrote a book called the great studies ancient world and they talked about ... or and\nNaples and an ... et cetera yes what you said most of them are at the at the er the crossroads of some great harbor or or or like a caravan from the east you know down to go on to saturate down

Bloomberg Radio radio one\nWhy FM Ninety we want to\nWalk on his radio in thousand Katie okay Beth Myers Senator Jim Inhofe had a lot to say today about the Brett Kavanaugh exactly\nRight he spoke out today about what judge Kavanaugh has been going through line Beth Myers the and the news radio one thousand Katie okay new center the FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations against the U.S Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is unprecedented according to Oklahoma a U.S Senator Jim Inhofe\nYeah and that's not like crazy clash and traffic circle of a decade ago [laughter] that was\nPicket lines at least rounding around I'm Talking about ones like them by saying that the federal yeah on tenth street it's one line you come up there and the time if we've been down there ... or apartment or something\nOr it wasn't a problem when it crabby but if you get a traffic around those things that are going to be a nightmare you're going to be sitting there and you're coming to a guy on his bicycle and and you're supposed to wait for that little round the bat which\nI think that must have been designed for a midget in Europe didn't much room you know the yeah in a car or the other things do seem to be an oriented towards\nA glaring war on your individual vehicular traffic [noise]\nUh [noise] like um when you get off to go to\nAnd Pam off of five forty or if your commute from Oklahoma city's suburbs it get off at western the editor at the mile from downtown\nYeah I that I just for the life of me can't figure out why the turnpike\nSystem put intersections at certain places and not others [laughter] running around\nTalking about you know you're coming off live forty and you get off western to go to your office now an Oklahoma say\nYes yes and then with the turnpike stew I mean like there's a ... there's a turnpike exit at western or I'm Sorry at Santa Fe but there's not one uh and Broadway extension and how much does that make yeah think of that\nBut a ... a member of the committee for a better uh Oklahoma boulevard better boulevard ... remember those folks\nThey fought like crazy to limit the four lanes and instead of a class and carry a lot of traffic and if they are six lanes turn lines as well at it\nBut the uh the better boulevard Oklahoma boulevard a is four lanes two lanes H way of course and you want to drive a mile from western to try to get downtown and go to work\nBetter choice is a a exit or wherever it becomes the cave a reward um\nUh she yes and it came\nBoulevard and and they're planning I think are have already done it a what they call streets\nYes ain't what happened they\nNarrow street where actually spending our tax dollars the narrow streets where we can have streets games\nSo I I Love I Love living in America we're getting into a car and we drive where we want when we want and what we describe it their\nWay had appointments to make and three quarters of the city one day uh-huh and we got on the expressway and we just knocked it all out we got all over the city and back home we didn't have to wait for a single buff restrict carte blanche to do it\nYeah yeah Roger that's a that's what I noticed in Washington DC when I was there and I've been in other big cities too but the other big cities don't have as good at planning as we do here in Oklahoma City now you hit on a lot of things let me catch them as best I can with my take as best I understand it\nThe reason that you don't see the hundred blocks on the street signs anymore is it took up too much room on the street signs\nNumber two most people aren't looking at the street signs anymore they're looking at their phone that's telling them where to go with whatever after she they're using to get them there so I think that's what they learn to do instead of putting up these hundred block signs everywhere um people are just typing in an address and it takes you right to it\nRoundabouts I have a love hate relationship with them depending on where they are and what they do\nIt seems to me the smaller roundabouts work better than a stop sign or a traffic light the large roundabouts you get stuck on and you're never going to get off\nOr when you drive in Europe you come across those all the time the large round about the whole roundabout might be several city blocks and you get stuck in the wrong lane and you can't merge to get off the roundabout but the small round about seem to be to me a better easier way to get through an intersection than a four way stop\nOr a traffic light and I think the reason they're strategically placed in the mid town area is because those are areas that can back up if there's a four way stop\nOr if there is a a stop sign the one you referred to by saint Anthony that just so happens to be a five way stop five intersections come together right there\nAnd so rather than trying to figure out who's going to go when and where when the traffic light changes they put in the round about it's a small round about and people can just kinda screwed around as they please\nExits at certain places I don't understand why uh I like you I don't understand why there aren't certain exits and what you would think would be a major intersection\nFor instance like uh Kilpatrick Turnpike and Broadway extension there it'd be I mean you can exit to the north which again as you to the south\nI don't understand that uh I don't understand why there is an exit off the turnpike at Penn in may but there's not one of the western I guess they figure it out when they were building these turnpike one had the most traffic and what didn't and that may have changed since then\nAlso you can't have an exit on a main thoroughfare at every intersection because it would back up traffic because the exit lean backs up\nWhen you get to um a rush hours\nAnd as far as you can Gaylord on the street ... skates are concerned I think by the time they finished with all those maps projects people aren't going to be driving e K Gaylord as the main thoroughfare to get through downtown they're going to be taking other roads so they won't be as congested when they are narrow it down\nThat's my take what's your ... and star when thousands hurts in Brazil high\nHigh I just like Mr Kevin Oh I Love beer yeah so do I but but um nobody seems to be mentioning that the prior to yesterday we have measured alcohol by weight not by volume therefore\nIt's only one and a half percent stronger that's it because all the other states and measured it differently than we did so basically the law we passed is how we measure of beer\nIt's really not that struck\nA ... well I I'm I I don't look it up okay\nI'll look it up credit for this argument before with other states and uh I I'm not sure it's accurate or it is a percentage of water per beer product and if they do that as a percentage of weight in some breweries and a percentage of\nOf liquid in another if the percentage is the same I think it works out to be the same but I've I've heard that argument before and um and then I'll look it up but I don't have time to get into it now a mix of news radio in thousand Katie okay Hi\nHello go ahead sir\nUh okay I'm a Vietnam veteran which means I'm a little bit long him too\n[laughter] I Know what that means a retired uh-huh\nAnyway I have had a\nWell I'm trying to keep it clean because I Am very angry about

least thirty hours and then vote on it but it would not be beyond Mitch McConnell to have a Sunday vote\nIn other words to keep things open for the thirty hours and or even a late Saturday Night and

available at\nKaty okay dot com we were talking about the FBI granted an extension and their investigation of Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court nominee Michael Bowers with us twenty four seven news in Washington DC so Michael what is the scope of this extension\nWell I think we won't know necessarily the details of what the scope is I can tell you this though there are people that are being question we do know that for instance\nOne of the big names in regards to all of this one of the big party happening Dr Ford was there and Brett Kavanaugh was there and Dr for delegations came to fruition were legal in Kaiser that's one of the big names and and according to reports the FBI sat down with Leon Kaiser on Saturday and began talking to her about what she recalled if anything\nFrom the party that night now that's just a portion of these allegations against\nBritain judge Kavanaugh from Dr Ford right but in addition to that we also know that as of yesterday a gentleman by the name of Charles Weddington yelled classmate to Brett Kavanaugh a wrote a note to the FBI saying that listen dead and Brett Kavanaugh has totally misrepresented himself as far as somebody who drink a lot\nHeavily and when he does he gets very aggressive and this is indicated by and then begin to tell a story about how Brett Kavanaugh bullied a patron at a bar with the singer from the ban you be forty although\nI don't know I'd ever seen what the singer of the band for you before he looks like but apparently Brett Kavanaugh supposedly knew who that was this guy said he was not that it began a bar fight at which point one of Brett Kavanaugh's friends was arrested Brett Kavanaugh was not but he was spoken to by police and all of that is getting invested by the FBI now so there's range\nWithin this investigation they're going to all sorts of elements to try to get information here over the span of this week and in the meantime Mitch McConnell saying that he's looking forward to a friday vote coming to the for the Senate\nSome level he's preparing for that it may be written in pencil at this point because we just don't know what's going to happen over the next couple of days and the scope of this investigation of what might come out that said he still planning on having a vote on friday what to see what this investigation bring forward\nAnd this would just be a cloture vote basically a vote to say All right we're going to stop talking about it and get ready to vote\nYeah correct do we have in the debate or do we not have the debate element on it and I think that's going to be highly detailed and whatever comes out of this FBI investigation like as we talked about the names of the people that have been spoken to already but then this morning there was a report that comes out from NBC News reporting that in the days leading up to the allegation\nFrom Deborah merits the Kavanaugh exposed himself to her uh there were texts between\nJudge Kavanaugh and his team communicating with friends behind the scenes\nTo refute that claim now the thing that becomes the bigger story here's you might recall Kevin I told the Senate Judiciary committee under oath\nThat the first time he heard of ... allegation was in the September twenty third article that came out of the New Yorker that was the first time he'd heard of it all these texts that now there are screen shots at the FBI has in their possession indicate that these conversations had between judge Kavanaugh his team and friends happened months in advance of that New Yorker article like back to\nJuly kind of months in advance which could indicate that not only to Kevin I Know about this at a time let's try to create a plan ahead of time but I did the White House know about this on any level how\nHow long before the September release of the story to Kevin uno and did the White House would they kept in the dark or did they keep this thing a secret as well so all of that is going to come forward and that seems to be in direct\nContrast to what the judge had set in his sworn testimony\nAbout Michael Bowers with us on who's ready when thousand Katie okay and twenty four seven news talking about the the Brett Kavanaugh\nOngoing saga and let's just boils down to what it really is it doesn't matter how much the judge drank in his past it doesn't matter uh what woman he had flirtation behavior with in his past\nWhat really matters is are those three Republicans that are still sitting on the fence got to be convinced about any of this that he's unfit or shall I say as the Democrats are now trying to say does he have the temperament to be a Supreme Court justice\n[noise] yeah I mean listen I Would think that most people that have worked with him as a judge would be able to attest to what kind of temperament he has won him sitting there with his robe on and listening to cases and hearing cases and making decisions\nAnd interpreting the constitution the way he needs to 'em so I think you'd have that answer pretty straightforward but I Will say that I think people like Senator Jeff Flake are still on the fence and I think hearing the stories that you're hearing ... again portion let's just remember we're hearing and portions of\nWhat is kind of coming out from the FBI investigation or we're hearing not from the FBI but we're hearing from people that were a part of the investigation or questioned by the FBI or hearing portions of this so I think Senator Jeff flake needs to get that information on his desk for him to make a decision but right now\nHe sure seems to think that there needs to be a thorough investigation before he can make any decision one way or the other here he did show concern and has made it very clear but if there were anything that would indicate that that a judge", "show_name": "Lee Matthews", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "02"}
