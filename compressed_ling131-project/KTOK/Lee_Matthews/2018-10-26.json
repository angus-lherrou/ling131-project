Trump and his disdain for the mainstream media\nAnd uh he has a record so I don't know what's going on there but he had been previously arrested for theft\nAnd illegal possession in use of steroids he does look like a big guy like the type of guy that likes to work out a his name is ... is our ...\nI'm not sure the origin of that name says are is usually the Spanish pronunciation of Caesar but I don't really recognize his last name is fifty six years of age uh lives in Florida but also has connections to New York\nSo I'm the FBI is going to be going over this case over the next couple of days

talking about consolidation and how and no matter what the um school board wants from the state until they start talking about what they're going to do to help save\nThe over forty percent of the budget that we're already spending on education if I were a lawmaker I Would say no you don't get a dime any more than what you've got until you start working on how you're going to either consolidate or make cuts elsewhere in administration\nIf the kids that need to be taught it's the education of our kids that were talking about we're not talking about\nSetting up a state sponsored business where educate tourists can immediately get a retirement paid for and Kenny immediately get triple digit salaries are becoming administrators I'm Sorry\nIf you are getting into the education realm because

statement saying they plan to challenge the unprecedented dismissal\nThe NFL grades referees at the end of each year on a three tiered at scale and usually it takes two seasons of being ranked in the lowest here before the league considers terminating an official\nThere are no reports that crews had any off field issues and I must say I did not watch the LA game\nI don't know that I've seen a game
