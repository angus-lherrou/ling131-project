amazing things that are given a trial debate was not one of\nRight we had great shop we had great vote tax rate of Avi but a boys and girls state we have that but we didn't have anything like this yeah\nThis is pretty incredible and I'm really excited there's been a I think a void from a\n... at the education perspective on civics yeah I remember when I went to high school um there was a ...\nSecond section of class that was dedicated to sit next sure and I think we've gotten away from that and so the younger generation just doesn't understand a civic engagement and this is a great opportunity for them to come together to learn about the process and really get involved\nWhen you're watching some of the national people running for national office in the terms you realize some of them don't know yeah yeah Seventy vices with a senator on who's ready one thousand Katie okay she's one of the senators are very responsible for the change in our liquor laws and that is one of the things that might have a chance to personally thank you for\nYou very much you know um it's been I don't think you get an opportunity to be part of changing something significant and see it come to fruition and we I I started that legislation and twenty Fifteen\nOriginally as a bill that would have allowed for refrigeration of of beer and liquor stores\nTurned into something very different which ... the public wanted to see past a in a number of sixteen by sixty five percent people wanted to see change and it was instant implemented last Monday I'll tell you were the first thing at a fantastic\nA journey that I've been on these last several years\nIt's a it was fantastic for me to go into the grocery stores and see them getting ready for this event yeah and and I felt like wow this is what you see in Kansas the switch in Texas is what you see in Mexico it's about time we had it here\nYeah and I think that was the one thing I heard from Oklahomans messages\nWe need to modernize when he did get with the times and other states are doing this and how and for many many years one of the challenges there was we had a lot of the provisions in the constitution and that meant that you had to how they voted the people to get out and that's a very lengthy process is a difficult one\nAnd nobody really wanted to take it on that as a freshman legislator I think I didn't know any better and so I thought why not let's do this so\nI'm Glad you did and if you want to run for president I voted for you wife and I will vote for you for whatever you're running a statement of fraud\nQuite a few people that have an exit or as a as a second social media platforms that they were excited to see the some\nYeah yeah what's your next project and you say right now are well you\nKnow there's a lot of things will be looking out I was recently named the finance chair for the Oklahoma State Senate which involves tax code and banking now I'm going to be really involved in

may be looking at some criminal justice reform and the initiative to run along with and the other things that that will be doing on the tax cuts I\nI think that will be at least one of the nature of the questions that they have time was tonight's debate here at Oklahoma City community college where in the performing arts center and the right now there was some preliminary projects are getting underway for the kids but it's the from now on project high school kids from all over the state or the or\nTo produce and conduct their own gubernatorial debate and the kids are asking the questions so that's what I like so much is one of your daughters participated actually I she'll\nShe will be in the audience um I have a a Seventeen year old so I think she's on the cusp of being able to vote and it's funny I happened to be up for re election and she said mom I really wish I was able to vote because I can do for you but but nonetheless I just am so thankful that\nI've had the opportunity to you as my children see the world of politics and civics and let them understand the importance of getting out to vote you know the climate has an incredibly low voter turnout\nAnd and we have to change that and I think this is a start for young people to really get engaged to get involved and know that our elected officials and and hot voice there um choices\nHow is the progress coming with

other measure to where the governor lieutenant governor ticket are offering a real choice to the people of the state of Oklahoma thank you\nThank you Mr Mr your answer\nYeah I I absolutely think that's the right thing to do a you know when you think about a team in a in a football team a or a business meeting but an organization you can't have people fighting and going in different directions you are the leaders got to set the vision of the strategy\nOr so I've already reached out to map a male and and reached out to joy half my sister and the attorney general in a I'm going to bring these folks together and set the vision of the strategy so when you have a lieutenant governor and a governor that are fighting you and go into different directions or we're not going to be very successful you've got\nTo have everybody moving to the same direction so I Can't imagine somebody at my company or or somebody in state government but we're not moving in the same direction and so you gotta have that at the top level leadership or or other states do what we should do it here in Oklahoma\nThinking it's just a question of every three is a question on health care for the kids he did it unless they hike or\nThings Mr Athens and this is Dave from now on twenty can seem to bring the oil debates are news radio on thousand Katie okay\nQuestion referring to education and Korea and failing hats and why do I go there and then a steady increase and murder teacher certification in Oklahoma education I don't even pay increase Halloween take fat to ensure that we have highly qualified educator used in the classroom this that and then you're in\nA thank you for the question a\nI find that very very interesting week for twenty six hundred is the figure right now emergency certified teachers in our schools twenty six hundred and we were approaching two thousand last year we started at over two thousand this year compared if you will\nTwenty twelve just six years ago\nThere were thirty to\nEmergency certified teachers in our school system that's how far and how fast we have sunk in our support for education we have lost teachers in droves\nTo other professions and to other states because of our inability to do what needs to be done for public education\nWhen I visited with teachers and I I did this the typically as a follow up to the a teacher walkout in Oklahoma City and by the way I was there when the teachers walked out I said I'd be there I was there we were with them we handed out water apples rivers\nPizza coffee you know whatever it took a to keep them energized [noise]\nBut I asked them aside from money what can we do to improve the quality of education and your particular classrooms\nOne of the things they mentioned in every one of those meetings that I had was that their guidance counselors aren't guidance counselors anymore that give tests and that great test and they aren't helping students in guidance to do what needs to be done\nThey said we need social workers in our schools because kids are coming to school with problems that we're not equipped to deal with they need textbooks that are up to date one of my favorite signs of the walkout was sorry I'm late but my textbooks said the capital was still in the gut for it [noise]\nThe teacher said over and over and over again this walkout is not just about a pay raise its about base funding for our schools\nIt's about conditions in the classrooms textbooks that are up to date and respect for the teaching profession and that's what I'm going to work on instilling as governor of the state of Oklahoma\nThinking this intense [noise]\n...\nYeah so my my heart breaks for the teachers as I've traveled the state and met with teachers and had town halls and met with the superintendents understanding what they need in their classrooms or it is a it is a a national problem right now\nAre the things that they're doing I mean I found out that the teachers now are having to or even as much as wash clothes when kids get their school so it's a it's a different job description than it used to be so we have got to encourage that profession or you don't pay is absolutely\nAre so important I Believe we have to pay teachers what market in the market to me is is what they do in Texas Kansas Arkansas kind of the states around us so I was excited the legislature passed and they're now\nNumber two in teacher pay in our region\nAnd I just released by education plan on Monday and I've got a plan to move them to number one in the region that will go a long way to let the teachers know when our state they're appreciated their values\nAre but it's also it's a recruiting issue so when I think about uh when I have a shortage of underwriters or how do we recruit more you know some of it is a subject also bonuses and retention in getting them getting them out into in into our state\nAnd so I've got a plan to match with the local dollars dollar for dollar up to five thousand dollars for new teachers coming into our states whether they're graduating from colleges or they're moving from another state we need to have a bonus program to recruit more 'cause it's not acceptable to have two thousand emergency certified teachers\nAlso I Want to change or make it easier to get certified\nWhen you think about we have three different certification tests in Oklahoma nationally there's one test used by thirty five different states the practice test so I Want to adopt that you're in Oklahoma to make it easier to ... recruits teachers from other states as well and then when you think about\nBack to the students or I Want every student to have an individual career or academic plan to make sure that you know what the future is for you and the career path\nIndividually for you thank you Mr sat [noise]\nFor anyone\nThousand Haiti okay like the ... in ...\nIn there and want to send fighter heir the high school we didn't regard nation as a medical marijuana in Oklahoma what precautions or you take to make sure that I'm not like it or they're not have access to the dry it's just that ... [noise]\nI I Know that uh the legislature the bipartisan committee is meeting right now\nAre talking about this very issue and as I've traveled all over the state all Seventy seven counties and met people um you know people are OK with medical marijuana\nOr if it's going to help somebody that they are absolutely fine with it I actually went and talked to some pain management doctors to find out\nWhat help people get off opioids and they said at certain situations it absolutely would so uh the problem is we've got to make sure it's available for those folks that need it and I know that's what they're working through right now through dispenser either how we're going to get it to the people that actually are are in pain in the that are that medicine\nAt the same time we have to protect and make sure we have a safe working environment uh we've got trucks on the road or we companies need to know how to test for\nHow to make sure that uh uh their their companies are ... so that's the other thing that we have to focus on a also I'd like to have\nYou know educational systems where we actually educate the students uh this is a serious drug it's not something to play with 'em you you you ought to consult a position to actually be prescribe this this drug so we've got to keep that out of the hands of the people that shouldn't shouldn't be on it\nAnd then obviously with the spin stories or they're going to be required to have shown\nSome type of card or some type of a a proof that they have a doctor's permission to get it and that's why how will keep it out of the hands of young people but we also need to educate to make sure that you guys know that it's not something to mess around with\nAnd uh and again you've got a wonderful journey and you do not need a ... mess around with a with those types of drugs\nThinking it's just fat and sadness and you're in the air thank you that\nIn November twenty sixteen the voters of the state of Oklahoma passed state questions seven eighty and seven eighty one\nUh which said that from now on a simple possession of marijuana and several other drugs I Will be a misdemeanor and will not be prison eligible\nOr even a second or subsequent offense that is now the law and the state of Oklahoma a but everybody should be aware that said that that seven eighty what you said it's not going to be a felony\nDid not make it legal so it is still against the law in the state of Oklahoma to possess or use marijuana unless you're a license they under the medical marijuana\nA regimen that's being set up as we speak by the department of health and perhaps by the legislature there is a bipartisan committee meeting right now to determine whether legislation is necessary\nSo the laws haven't changed as the legalities\nOf non medical marijuana they're still on the books and all of the enforcement mechanisms are in place that were in place before November of twenty sixteen the only difference is and frankly I voted for seven eighty and seven eighty one so I'm saying this is a good thing\nYou're not any longer going to be prison eligible for simple possession of drugs and I think that's going to help reduce our prison population I think that's gonna be a good thing and are there are still sanctions in place that can be in place I I mean\nIf you've ever spent a day and a county jail you don't want to spend six months or a year in a county jail and that sanction is still in place\nUh so uh we need to caution all of our citizens that is still against the law regardless of the medical marijuana or issue being before us\nA counseling is important in a drug and alcohol and mental health treatment is still important and I'm a great advocate of that as well\nUh but uh simply enforcing the law will be the tax on a\nRecreational marijuana that has not yet been legalized in the state of Oklahoma\nThanks This is the from now on twenty Eighteen gubernatorial debate on news radio and powers in Haiti okay\nForeign foreign at nothing high school\nIn ...
