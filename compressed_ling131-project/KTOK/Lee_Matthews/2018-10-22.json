are making sure these people are ... and under wants a guys I don't know and so I've I've read something that the Catholic charities has something to do with this\nAnd make sure that these people get to a safe\nDestination I've also heard that there is a an organization that's called um a charity in demand which is funded by George Soros and others who are are trying to make it look like they're
