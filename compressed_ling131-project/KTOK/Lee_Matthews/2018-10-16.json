Charlie powers a pow all the um the libertarian candidate and kept it unfair\nAnd you had a lot to say about that so we'll get into that coming up on his radio in thousand Katie okay also we are going to talk to our good men are who are with twenty four seven news and a will be joining us from Washington and from New York\nEven the Cherokee Nation is sounding off on the um uh um the the the Warren yes Senator Warren and Elizabeth\nWarren's ... you know having her DNA tested and oh see I Do have some I Do have some some Indian and me are Native American and me and even they have something to say about that so do you also some harsh words from Oklahoma Second Amendment association and this is if you live and Logan and pain county\nThey want you to know that state representative Corey Williams and state representative maintain an F with the Oklahoma Second Amendment association voting record including this year voting against churches having immunity with a self defense action\nWorried half were to happen inside the building according to Oklahoma Second Amendment association it appears Corey Williams is contempt for the church being sued out of existence that go on to say representative Williams as a district attorney which he's running for in\nThe district that covers Logan in pain counties may find gun owners in his sights for prosecutor abuse like we see from so many Democrat prosecutors\nOklahoma Second Amendment association goes on to say that Korea Williams voted against or walked the votes on open carry constitutional carry private property rights and the military and even for a person to carry a hand gun for self defense well hunting\nSo according to Oklahoma Second Amendment Association He is not the one you should be voting for for da andme Logan in pain county that's from Oklahoma Second Amendment association\nI tell you that because not only are they on the front end of a lot of our Second Amendment rights protecting our Second Amendment rights and at this time actually holding to park speak to the fire who are trying to ban guns in their parks\nWhen that's against the law that's against Oklahoma law the new Oklahoma laws\nSo that you should know that I Am not in Logan county or pain county but if you aren't want to sound off or a bus with Oklahoma Second Amendment association is to say You're welcome to where they borrow in thousand STAR One thousand markets in Edmond all news radio on thousand Katie okay\nHi I'm first I don't know how our congressman voted our senators legislators Washington what about a year ago or maybe a year and a half Rubio has legislation going through and he had an amendment on its\nMake English the official language of the United states because we have no official legal language and I know that won't stop people from walking across the river but it would at least establish some things that are\nIndigenous to the United states that that we could use a in the future when immigration get straightened out that people are supposed to be able to speak English when they come to your students who come here are testing to see if they can speak English as a foreign language\nAnd that seems like a good idea to me the other thing is I'm from Michigan and there was an old blonde the books from Michigan about two hundred years old but says if you're at a church\nAnd the churches rock and you have a handgun you are required by law to defend the church I think that's kinda neat\nI Do too and that you know I Wish we had such a law here in Oklahoma but when gun nut started taking over our legislature and started passing laws for the quote unquote safety of the public\nUh they started eliminating certain rights like that\nAnd I'm ... and so I don't know that it that it should be a requirement mark so much as a gun owners should be allowed to not only carry their guns in church if they feel that the need to but if something does break out and they defend themselves and uh other members of the church that won't be sued\nAnd that's what the uh with that particular law I was mentioning had to say about that\nAs far as English being the official language I'm not a fan of that\nAnd here's why because if it were to pass it would be very expensive it would mean\nThat every publication that has any non English word in it will have to be either amended or reprinted\nTo have the official English word in it I'll give you an example here in Oklahoma we have a lot of names of cities and towns that are of Native American nature and have Native American names to them in fact the city the
