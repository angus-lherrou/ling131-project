bit and you can hear the whole thing is Katie okay dot com on these ready when thousand Katie okay Brian writes on social media Lee if you're a if you have a Second Amendment right to defend your property and if it extends to your car then so does your Fourth Amendment right to privacy\nUh Brian you are correct you have a certain right to privacy in your car unless you are breaking the law in your car\nIf their smoke billowing out of the sides of your windows and you can't be seen from the inside that probable cause to pull you over and check your privacy\nIf you're a word serving around the lanes in your car that is probable cause for the police to pull over and search your vehicle and\nWhen we're talking about driving because you petition the government for in many cases received permission from the government to drive\nYou therefore surrender your because one of the agreements when you sign that driver's licenses that you will have insurance\nAnd if you don't have insurance the government can do something about it the state government can do something about it and that's the thing we're not talking about searching and seizing because nobody's stopping your car and nobody's looking inside your car so your privacy is not being violated\nNow I don't like it either I don't like being monitored by the government but this is one of those cases if you don't want to be monitored by the government you probably should not drive anywhere anytime\nYou should probably also never use a credit card you should probably also never give your name address and phone number out to anybody anytime you probably should give up your cell phone because those can be tracked you should never be on social media because of that can be tracked\nYou shouldn't subscribe to public power because they can track how much power using and what times of day you're using it you shouldn't have cable TV or satellite t._v. because they're monitoring what you're watching and when you're watching it\nThere are a lot of times you give a privacy and there was a there is a reasonable a balance that you can maintain\nAnd I don't like the fact that the\nPolice can scan your driver's license tag and immediately tell whether or not you got insurance or not either but I Would rather them check that way\nThen check one I've had an accident and the person who has caused the accident doesn't have insurance that is happening to me twice\nAnd you know what my thoughts were walking away from that experience man I Wish the government do more to make sure people have insurance when they're on the road this was one way to do that\nA four when thousands STAR One thousand DM says Lee I think the kind of thing we can do\nTo the people who are approaching our border from the south is

that the police can scan my license tag and to tell where I've been driving\nI don't like that but it is not\nA violation of your Fourth Amendment I'm afraid it is not your Second Amendment right by the way is guaranteed by the Constitution's another example of a right\nVersus a privilege you have a right to bear arms you have a right to a gun it's spelled out in the constitution you do not have a right to drive\nYou do not have a right to privacy and you do not have a right to marriage you have to reach out to the government for a\nLicense for that fortunately for the most part the
