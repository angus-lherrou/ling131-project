else over time also a real ... there were many reasons that we we dropped Seventy years ago and I don't see any of them have been approved show\nI was well if we drop street cars that meant that long ago because people started getting cars people started driving people were driving themselves they didn't have to rely on public transportation that\nExists today now I understand there's a lot of people moving into the mid town in downtown areas and that they want to be able to get around without having to get their car out and drive you know a short distance just to get somewhere I understand that\nUm but I still don't think we are big enough downtown or mid town to to have a need to to install these things that you're not going to be able to get around you're not going to be able to\nA stop in front of them uh if someone decides to park on the tracks and hold everything up it's gonna happen\nAh they're already having problems with people on like skate boards and bicycles
