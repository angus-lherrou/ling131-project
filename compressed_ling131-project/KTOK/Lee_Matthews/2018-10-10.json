joining us first of all yeah thanks for him to suddenly ... tell us about from now on how does this get going yeah I mean from now on really was just uh\nThe concert organically I'm with one of my colleagues and friends in Oklahoma Legislature I'm center Adam Pew and he and I just we had we spend a lot of time in in school districts are in our own districts and\nWe had just had gotten so frustrated as I think many Oklahomans 'em and many Americans that you know have been frustrated with the whole political process of just\nConstant uh partisanship um you know constant difficulty in getting real issues solved and and the more that we would be out in high schools and and the more we would have the opportunity to talk with high school kids\nAnd the more we were hearing from them that they wanted something different and so it's kind of a mix of I'm\nWanting to engage young people um as well as just known facts that state of Oklahoma if you break down demographics Eighteen to twenty four year olds a vote at about eleven point seven percent rate it's the lowest in the country\nAnd what we know is that if young people don't start voting and don't start participating in the process at a young age that it's less likely they'll participate when they get older\nSo we started from now on to\nGo out and in a very non partisan way engage young people to get involved in their communities and to participate in the process\nTo get registered to vote and um to learn about the candidates make the best choice for them and learn how to vote learn how to be a vote or learn how to get engaged and then in the meantime ah you know just try to bring a whole different level of civil discourse to the table\nAnd made that the truth a district representative Jason Done them a of a a from now on with the organization now and they're going to be holding their own student run gubernatorial debate tomorrow it's going to feature drew had mentioned\nA Kevin ... gubernatorial debate from six until seven at the old triple C visual and performing arts center\nIf you don't know where that is it's on south may can't miss it seven Seventy seven south may and if you want to attend you

necessarily I mean we have both gone to that walk out that was um last year by other than that I was kind of our first getting into government issues and stuff like that\nJake do you have a particular issue that you would like to ask the candidates yeah so\nUm some of the issues that Kevin popping up as we've discussed what we are going to ask a education's kind of been the one that we want to see the opinion of the candidates on what they have to say about the walkout and future plans putting forward\nDo you have a a particular leaning right now I mean are you looking at India one of the candidates with any particular interest\nOr we're hoping that kind of what the debate will show us and so give us our opinion or give us the ability to form an opinion based on what they believe and coming from them speaking to students\n... what do you think of the political process I mean we just heard that a more young people are not participating are you seeing that at your school\nI Am I I Know a lot of my friends are Eighteen and a lot of them aren't even registered to vote yet and I think I'm this organization to really really wants to change that I really believe that we need to change that in order to be able to to vote make decisions help and make decisions like that because we are Eighteen to twenty five is a big age group\nAnd that that vote matters you're about matters he's Eighteen year old my friend there but it's not earned can change in the way and all that stuff I think that's a really big deal and so I think and if we don't change its profits now ...\nI asked Jake the same question uh what do you think is the most important issue or what is there an issue that you want to ask the candidates\nUm so I formulated a question about and the joint ticket lieutenant governor governor renting together when he had a opinions on that\nAnd other things just like an agriculture and praise then so a bunch of different stuff we have a variety of questions do

mean look\nIf you look at what happened and and this was another reason I wrote killing yes houses because if if you go around Oklahoma City today and ask kids about the Holocaust or going to look at you like what I don't know anything about it not being taught about it in school [noise] um so we need to know what human beings are capable of\nAnd in Germany I mean these people were shopkeepers farmers lawyers a banker and all of a sudden a war starch and they're dressed up as a black suit with a despot insignia killing babies they what what how does that happen\nAnd then in America when we see a display of a I mean there's always a word for it it's it's hatred and hatred leads the evil\nOr the direct correlation so we're at the hatred level now we're there\nAnd one is the evil going to START I think is already start yeah people walking into schools killing schoolchildren got where it's abusing kids you got city of Chicago thousands being shot by drug gangs and little being done about it\nI mean that's just evil so I think we're a nation that you know could go either way and people got to think about this\nAuthor of killing the ss Bill O'Reilly is with us the hunt for the worst war criminals in history a building think indelible Jill ... in a ... a ...\nAnd the damage to the process of finding a Supreme Court justice is irreversible has that been done you think\nUh I don't I think it's more the damage that was done isn't so much to the Supreme Court process which I think all play out the next\nFew years with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and perhaps um Breyer um because burners eighty and gives whereas eighty five [noise] um I think you're going to see partisanship but at the damage that I saw was to due process in this country\nI mean we you had fifty percent of Americans willing to believe an allegation that was completely unsubstantiated now what are you sympathize with the\nUm person who made the allegation I don't have a beef with that you know if you watch on TV and you see her testimony and use sympathize with her but I don't have a problem with that but you can't turn around and burn somebody at the stake\nUm because of an allegation is not cooperated you can not do that and call yourself a loyal American and that's really the damage that I saw a done\nBill O'Reilly is with us killing the ss as a book in the number one best selling history series I'm a history than bill I've read all the killings series including killing the ss and I wanted to talk a little bit about this the hunt for the worst war criminals in history and again I I I don't know bill if\nIt hits Hitler was worse or the minions working for him or worse after reading your book\nIt's all the same and I appreciate your reading the book Lee it's a pleasure to talk to somebody you know who who does\nHis homework um what you have is a a system that was put into place to exterminate Jews gypsies homosexuals and all along the line of people political dissenters\nAnd that system was accepted by the German people now the German people the same as the American people are the German Americans are the largest ethnic group in the u._s._a. and there's no difference I mean if you go to Germany and you speak a different language but it's the same\nA kind of thing so how could that happen um again we go back to the evil that that people don't understand it and if you don't understand that it's much easier to embrace it\nI mean we live in a country now where the president United States basically says and I'm Talking about block Obama not Donald Trump you know if you sell heroin um and that's a non violent crime\nI mean how many people have to die before President Obama gets it that selling heroin and opiates and hard drugs is evil\nHow many people have died Mr President for you don't understand that you know ... it's just staggering to me and then when we read in the book we if you if you are interested in World War two in the aftermath who the people who help these ss get away\nUm the red cross in Switzerland the CIA and America\nAre members of the Catholic Church in Italy they all help them get away how could you do that I made a mango and form in and Barbie I mean these were men who killed on the level of hundreds of thousands and you're helping them get away\nAnd then after they did get away they had a track them down which is an amazing story in itself\nSo it's a thriller I mean you know you pick up ... says you're not gonna be able to put it down easily um and it just says you said was the eighth edition the first seven we have Seventeen million copies in print of the killing series the most successful non fiction series and history\nWe talked about this last time Bill O'Reilly or not you're writing style and are you and Mr dug coal a writer or you'd you'd I Love the way you use short sentences that or to the point\nBut mostly footnotes and foot notes that don't get you trapped in rabbit holes um I'll give you an example one of the footnotes in killing Jesus was right down to what the Roman soldiers were eating before the crucifixion and you've got a lot of those sprinkled throughout this text\nYeah so we really want to entertain a people who read the killing books but we also want one form and so that you know one of the shocking things and killing the ss is that there was a woman living in San Francisco for Fifteen Years who was a concentration camp part\nAnd who did brutal things and she got away and went to San Francisco married a Jew live there for fifty years\nAnd before the state department tractor down All right and center back to Germany where she is alive today and every month get say American Social Security checks sent to her can you believe it I Can't believe I'm sitting in my head was blowing off why\nI and and these are true things that are relevant today\nAnd so those are the kinds of things that we like to put in the book because we know a nobody knows that we are fortunate to have ... open its files to us on the hunt for a minute and the others and people have never seen that information before\nSo you know if you're a fishy in Idaho of World War two and you you're interested in it as a as a book for you\nBill O'Reilly the other thing you reveal and uh I knew I had heard were springs of the Argentina connection\nBut ah one of the things that struck me well reading what you reveal about Eva Peron and and Juan Peron a there's an entire musical dedicated to these people [laughter] I Will never watched that musical again\nIs staggering after in\nThe last year or two hundred and ... the head of the U.S I knew they were going to lose right near the Germans and going down so they formed an organization called the Odessa\nAnd it had a lot of money and the the Nazis uh basically counted on Odessa to get them out of Germany after the Russians and the allies came in and defeated them so that's basically pays off wanting to beat the prone to to millions\nAnd millions of dollars or you know gold and that uh that's where they were paid to allow the Nazis in to Argentina and here they come\nGuess it was ss ... there were sneaking up on the uh the squad or whatever but tuned into it he kept saying no this is a success and they were what would ask me doing out here but black uniform means you are out\nYes [laughter] anyway\nThey found out well that was right before ... and they give him a\nBronze star with combat vie for valor wow she alerted basically the you know you learned the the\nMission that are walk an ss year and that's really unusual\nYeah a while if you did you have something to say about uh about stoops because I needed to get to hang on again\nFor that if you will a random we'll get to that and just a minute news radio

Willie Mae thanks for\nTaking my call you know what I like them\nSo that makes everything on the air a Web site at that point\nI said it leaves me why didn't you believe me unbelievable all the news all our shows on line I feel pain\n... map using four oh one thousand STAR One thousand to join the conversation and we're talking to a a good friend Randall about ... salary what do you think\nWell that's the way the contracts are written I mean there's it's a contract we'd go by the law and uh yeah I don't I think it's bad but\nAnyway Kansas barred man Gino is head coach 'cause he was that oh you when they won the chip chip in two thousand but anyway they fired him because he yelled at a football player which\nI thought that's what football coaches do\nYou\nThey fired him and then they got Turner you from Nebraska and they fired him a year or two later and then they got Charlie wise from a Notre Dame they fired him and hired somebody else so at one point they were paying the coach is three former coaches and the former coaches were getting three million a year\n[laughter] and not make that uh I don't I have no you're not making that up\nRandall and again nice work if you can get it builds him for his work and in New York with the news division of our I hard media family twenty four seven news bill and the announcement about Nikki Haley came down a lot of people were taken by surprise\nSure did a it was a shocker in fact ... apparently the only person who knew about this was President Trump who said that\nI she had mentioned something to him six months ago that\nShe might be hanging it up at the end of the year ... has been the most well protected secret of the entire Trump Administration thus far because even my mom patio to know about it a security director uh John Bolton didn't know about it\nA Nikki Haley staff didn't find out about it until yesterday people at the UN didn't know about it and were caught by surprise so it was either a well protected secret or the timing and reason for this resignation remain a mystery\nWell that's what everybody speculating about and I immediately were speculating about it until I heard the words from the president and from Nikki Haley herself and then when she said you know I\nI I'd only committed to two years whichever remembered her saying when she was talking to him about the secretary ship in the first place and I knew she was a governor before that so I can sit back and say I bet she is tight because this isn't an easy job\nIt's not and if you look at if you look at the record the UN ambassador post is a high turnover position and there are some people who uh who spent four years in that post Susan Rice a and the most recent UN ambassador as well but\nUh other than that this has been a high turnover position so it's not unusual I think what what everybody is wondering about is what will she do now\nA why now for her and and you know what led to this and why is she making this announcement right now so a lot of speculation about that of course the speculation that\nShe might make a presidential run down the line well won't happen in twenty twenty yeah does she weighed all the wait till twenty twenty four and then take on my pants I I mean I think the timing of this is the thing that really gets everybody\nThe other thing Lee is\nDoes this come down to a money issue because now there are reports out that she and her husband are deeply in debt or they have a couple of kids that are either in college ready to go to college\nSo they have extra expenses piling up and when you look at the fact that she could probably make more in one speaking engagement now then she got an entire year as you and and ... maybe that's a factor as\nWell I did not realize that so that does make a lot of sense also uh I said this is a difficult job it's all about like\nBeing secretary of state because you probably on call twenty four seven because there are things happening with the United nations twenty four seven you all I mean you could be at your daughter's graduation and have to go answer the phone\nAbsolutely yeah it is a ... and you know what everybody agrees that Nikki Haley did a great job I as you want to ... representative for the United states getting the Trump Administration policy out there to the rest of the world or did I did a very good job at that", "year": "2018",
