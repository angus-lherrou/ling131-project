the old timers from Oklahoma old timers association on these radio one thousand Casey okay a cabin writes via social media this was over the weekend I heard you talking about roundabouts and traffic and the light rail system I am one hundred\nPercent behind the light rail systems in Oklahoma City and in the metro um millions in but I'm not for the um light rail that is just downtown millions spent and it's basically pointless\nIf you look at the dart system it works well that's in Dallas by the way Kevin goes on to say it actually goes places and serves a purpose in fact you can ... to the Santa Fe station here in Oklahoma City\nTake the heartland flyer to the inner mobile and Fort Worth take the Texas Eagle to Union Station in Dallas and that hop on the dark and go to Plano all by rail a few blocks here is pointless if it went outside the Edmund or to a Mustang\nOr more in Norman North West Oklahoma City that\nWould be worthwhile less dummy is on the road\nAnd Kevin yeah that's that's my point is well my point is now I'm I've been told by the transportation cats oh we gotta start somewhere now my only thing\nIs that Kevin I'm you know the only reason we have traffic problems right now is because of construction if we didn't have construction traffic would be moving very smoothly from Oklahoma City down to a more and more down to Norman\nAnd once the loop around those parts of the city is finished with the new\nUm ... the new um turnpike that will alleviate that now I Do have problems with turnpike I I I I don't like the idea that we're having to pay extra money to drive on a road that we shouldn't be paying are probably paying for anyway but that's a different battle for a different day\nAnd so that is also why I think we don't need light rail because we have a excellence a highway system now will we grow into a day where we will need it\nMaybe so maybe so but like you said right now there's not enough to make people need other than going into a gamer going

Bloomberg Radio news radio one\nA excise why FM Ninety six point one\nThe campaign is going where and what I'm hearing around the state is a much the same as what I was hearing last year that the state of our schools are the quality of our education the plight of our teachers\nAre overcrowded classrooms poor textbooks all of those uh or at the front of the leading issue and that's education\nWell let's get right to do that by how do you plan to solve this problem we already voted in one I'm a teacher pay raise but uh how you gonna fix the problem in Oklahoma for teachers\nOr what we passed back in April was a little bit north of four hundred million dollars in additional revenue\nAnd they provide a six thousand dollar pay raise for teachers which is welcome and I commend the legislature forgetting the Seventy five percent vote they needed to do that\nIt was however uh over three hundred million shy of ... step up Oklahoma had asked for they ask for more than seven hundred million the teachers\nWere saying eight hundred and nine hundred million was necessary there there was no significant increase in funding for the schools themselves\nAnd they've had no increase in their ADA allocations for ten years\nSo the schools are still suffering and there was not much relief for teachers are who are more experienced or who have a master's degree are the ones that get a five ten years in the classroom\nAnd all of a sudden are worth a whole lot more in Kansas Arkansas Oklahoma than they are taxes and they are in Oklahoma and get hired away\nSo we've got to do ah the majority leader John ... a Republican said we need five hundred million or two hundred and fifty million a four H. this next year and a year after\nThe revenue measures that are proposing are putting the grass production tax back at seven percent doing away with a capital gains loopholes for millionaires uh and the other fifty cents a pack of cigarettes\nThat would raise and access at three hundred million additional dollars a meeting the goal of step up Oklahoma and are working toward that goal set by a majority leader John ... of the Republican leader of the house\nDriven since joining us on news radio in thousand Katie okay right now we're talking teacher salaries and how to fix the problem any talk or because this is something that's that I've had a lot of people called this program about the and Mr Edmondson is a consolidation about our school district\nHas been some talk about that and there's a fund available at the state level to\nAh facilitate consolidation of school districts or choose to do that\nIt's a very difficult situation when you talk about a forcibly closing a school when the school board and the community want to keep it open but I think we can do a lot of good uh by talking to a local school boards\nAt the advantages of consolidation the fact that ah each school because they're an offer more courses than either one could offer by themselves\nAnd I would be approaching it in that direction and making sure there's money in the phone to assist and then are spreading the message or where consolidation might be a good idea or and trying to encourage the local boarders to do that\nCandidate for governor drew had been since with this news radio in thousand Katie okay a another big issue that has been crossing the border of this program in particular was the detail of constitutional Gary do you have any ah any views on the constitutional carry measure or if it were to come across your desk as governor\nWhere in my opinion we have constitutional carry the second amendment assures the right to keep and bear arms uh and I am a I'm\nA I have a concealed carry permit personally I carry it aside or when I was a district attorney over in Muskogee particularly if I was going on a search warrant are going to a crime scene and I carried a and M. sixteen and or\nIn Vietnam so uh I Know something about firearms and I know something about law enforcement\nAnd I believe that uh we should preserve the ride in Oklahoma and make sure that people who are on the terrorist watch list\nAre walking down the sidewalk carrying a side arm as well as people who have felony convictions or have been a institutionalized with mental health problems or have been a at the\nPerpetrator of domestic violence those are the kinds of things that I have to be answered appropriately if you get a concealed carry permit as ... background check and I think that's appropriate and would live to preserve those safeguards another\nIssue that's been creeping up both on a state or a question and I'm In our elections as well as well marijuana we certainly know that medical marijuana seems to be the new law the land but what are your thoughts on medical and recreational marijuana\nBut I think we're as more work to do on medical and I know the health department is looking at it in terms of ah administrative rules and I also know that there's a legislative task force bipartisan are looking at potential legislation in this arena\nSo I'm looking forward to\nThose developments as they happen\nAnd if the legislative recommendations come in the next session of the legislature and governor I'll be looking at him a lot more closely out and make sure that they facilitate a recreation that out recreational medicinal marijuana rather than throwing up roadblocks in a way of it\nOr did you ask about recreational re getting ready to\nGo through that in so yeah we can talk recreational\nOr I Know there's a lot of a sentiment in favor of that and I know that Colorado has arrived a lot of tax revenue from it but I Would urge at least for the short term\nA wait and see and do our steady on Colorado in Oregon and Washington see what they've done right see what they've done wrong and if there is either legislation or initiative petition\nWe make sure to include in it what other states are doing that seems to be a best practice and avoid a what problems may have resulted or the other states didn't expect when they adopted there's\nThat would also give time for the federal government to recognize now that are over thirty states have either recreational or additional that this is creating a real problem for banks\nBecause you can't use a check you can't use a credit card or all transactions have to be in cash and that is posing a real problem or not only security of the facilities but also a four bags and state government if you can imagine\nColorado getting four hundred million in tax dollars all paid in cash that that's a problem\n[laughter] so I think down the road Congress is going to be looking at it uh you know and ordinary citizens are saying that we ought to do something about our marijuana laws it's one thing when the banks start saying you know ... laws a problem for us\nThen I think a Congress might take a real serious look at a changing their laws and at least allowing banks to participate in the states where either medical or recreational has been made legal\nDrew had mentioned joining us candidate for governor on news radio went down some Katie okay we certainly have seen the ups and downs of oil prices in our state in the last say four to eight years and its effects on our tax base or is there any hope of diversifying our tax base so we are not so dependent on the price of oil\nWhether certainly hope in diversifying our tax base and the key to that is economic development existing businesses expanding and new businesses coming in\nThe problem is over the last eight years we have short changed as a very agencies of government there are supposed to be working on that uh the Commerce Department it has had their budget slashed\nA vote cast the Oklahoma Center for the advancement of science and technology as had their badges slash oh cast as the conduit for funding for a group called I to eat which provides entrepreneurial money for startup companies and it's had its magic cat\nSo ah we've got to reverse that and start funding the agencies of government that are primarily responsible for recruiting business to come in\nA on top of that I think we need to be ah [noise] doing more in the area of renewables wind energy we're now number two in the nation\nBut we're not doing a whole lot and we are capable of doing a whole lot more in both solar energy and geothermal energy out and we're already a leader I Would expect and hydroelectric power power generated by dams in Oklahoma\nSo we can do some diversification in that arena as well\nAs the important thing is to have more business more economic grow\nJust for additional revenue I Am in favor of that and I'm going to work to accomplish it I hear from ... to Tulsa in Oklahoma City chamber spokesman that they've talked to businesses who have asked why should we invest in Oklahoma when you're not\nYeah I Would think the word waste fraud and abuse in every single a candidate a vocabulary for forever\nBecause nobody nobody regardless of what part of your end\nShould be happy with our money getting wasted interview and uh I I was surprised to not to not get a push from that even with it without you answer um because I'd like to do that or ... or ... certainly trying\nI think everybody would Joe thanks for the call a news radio one thousand Katie okay if you want to hear a podcast on
