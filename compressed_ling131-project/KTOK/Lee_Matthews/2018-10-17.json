morning because not only is it here in Oklahoma but it seems to be spreading throughout the country\nAnd we're going to talk to our source at twenty four seven news or national news division at our parent company by heart radio I hurt medium this mysterious disease some are saying is similar to polio\nActually it um it has its own name acute ... mile light is\nOr also it's called a FM now it's not a new virus or disease but it's been showing up in kids between six and eight years of age and the reason they're saying it's like polio is it produces similar symptoms in that there's paralysis\nFacial paralysis or some child may not be able to use their arms or move their arms it's also showing up very much like a polio does at first there's a fever and flu like symptoms and then all of a sudden these neurological things show up so what you can do about it\nAnd what you should do about it we're going to discuss with a build them for who will be joining us ... about forty minutes from now here on his radio on thousand Katie okay but it's a little scary that we've actually had one ah found here in Oklahoma\nAdditional symptoms include facial grouping weakness difficulty moving eyes difficulty swallowing and slurred speech now here's what I Am curious about since they keep comparing it to polio if you had the polio vaccine which you then be\nVaccinated from this I don't think so because it's not ... polio it's of its blasted my Elias\nBut I'll ask the expert when we talk to him a little later on Michael Bowers going to join us as well\nAh he has more on the disappearance of that Washington Post columnist Jim ... where things are getting even more bizarre and that story and that's coming up to a news radio on thousand Katie okay April and thousand start one thousand to join the conversation oh did you happen to see the Saturday Night live routine I mentioned a minute ago\nUh where they were trying to do cages and it just didn't work I mean someone told me that when they got halfway through that that it was like wow they didn't know exactly where to go with that at all it just died\nBut what do you think [noise] and there's a new development and the Daniel holes clock case\nOr in case you didn't remember that case it was August twenty four team the state charged Daniel Holtzclaw a police officer with thirty six family accounts of rape sexual battery indecent exposure enforceable oral nastiness\nAfter Thirteen Women came forward claiming that he assaulted them while they were in his custody or inside his police car it all the jury heard Thirteen accusers\nAnd then twenty Fifteen convicted holtzclaw of Eighteen felony charges involving eight of the Thirteen accusers\nAnd he was sentenced to two hundred sixty three years in prison the jury also recommended that he'd descended uh that uh uh that uh he ... he was sentenced to the two hundred sixty three years after which holds claw filed several petitions asking for appeal [noise]\nThis past well it was today in fact uh Oklahoma quarter of criminal appeals unsealed his fifth prop ... proposition which sought to prove that he received an effective assistance of counsel\n... ... came a long time that he's thinking well over ... back for a long road can I get out of Iraq by Iraq\nI'll Try to I sure will Sherri thanks for things for the the tip on that you know ... the first thing that caught my attention about this case\nWas that okay it our vaccinations involved because\nSo many people are not vaccinating their children were seeing resurgence of measles we're seeing resurgence of whooping cough I'm waiting for there to be a resurgence of polio because\nPeople refusing to vaccinate their children for whatever reason and I always get tons of a social media when I mentioned vaccinations you're wasting your breath I'm a believer and vaccinations and I think everybody should have whatever's available to them\nNow whether or not you want to stagger how much your kid gets over a period of time that's your business and I'm not a believer in the government making you do it that said I think you should do it I think you should you should partake of what modern science has provided for us all and our immune systems\nAnd those who don't don't remember the polio wards that used to exist I I've got a good friend of the family as name as any Provo\nAnd he was eight years old swimming at a friend's swimming pool\nThis was back in the fifties any climbed out of the swimming pool and started sneezing and just thought he was about to catch cold by the time he got home\nHe couldn't move his legs within an hour he was in an ambulance on his way to a polio ward\nA and this was down in Louisiana the nearest polio award was in um New Orleans and he said in that polio ward a until he learned to walk with braces or for a good six eight months through Christmas I mean it was a terrifying disease and it used to sweep through neighborhoods just like that\nAnd so to say I'm not going to vaccinate because I'm scared of the vaccination is I think I think is is is that you're you're hurting yourself if you if you have that attitude

that's\nSome people still get shingles\nDue to whatever reason\nNow I'll tell you what I had the singles vaccination\nBecause I've seen people who have it and they all tell me you but if you don't want it yeah so I I pay the fifty bucks or whatever it was it took it to to not have to worry about not to not to now chances are chances are I'd probably what's going to get it you know why because I had the chicken pox when I was a kid yeah now\nWhen I'm ... now here's what I Will grant you I Will grant you that sense there is a chicken pox vaccination when there was that when I was a kid\nWhen I was a kid your parents prayed you'd get the chicken pox at a young age so you wouldn't get it over and uh so I had the chicken pox\nUh but my nieces and nephews of all had the vaccination so ... is there a problem with the vaccination not allowing them the proper antibody to develop in these kids who are vaccinated that is read booting the shingles I don't know exactly\nWhat that he was making was the fact that it now they're immunized yeah see parents then don't have the booster\nYes so but it's also a law of averages I mean I've had people approach me before well a ... and you know there's there's a there's odds of that you can still get it or you could die from it and all that and and to me it comes down to our those around them want to live with\nA I'm I'm willing to live with it at was willing to live with the odds of getting machine as if I didn't have the vaccination\nYeah but the vaccination was available I could afford it so I took it\nAnd see that's what it should be is everyone weighing risk with an absolutely um I don't know if you've ever heard about some of the legislation that's been pushed recently in Oklahoma to for some of those in\nIndia but yes I have an I'll tell you why that is because of public schools yes just a couple of public public school so you have to decide whether or not you're going to allow the state to raise your children for you or you are going to raise your children the way you see fit\nNow all that said even if you don't send your kids to public school I encourage you to go get your vaccinations for your kids [laughter] I encourage don't demand that don't exist but I encourage\nAnd what I Would say is good for you to encourage and I would say make sure you look into and weigh the risks sure\nGood conversation thank you
