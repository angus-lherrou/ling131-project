SNL was though did you see this thing went as back with us and that was funny okay uh yesterday\nI was talking about Saturday Night live ... ... a liberal on yup\nSketch this past weekend and it sucked\nIt ... it was bombed it bombed I mean\nMy ... and the love Kevin my producer and a pop culture expert you don't even know Cajun culture and you thought it bombed\nOr by bumped severely they they are not what if what I saw it and it opened with you know the Louisiana Lafayette yeah oh ... okay they're trying to agent man\nYeah I thought they were bringing back Cajun man which by the way\nWas an old cache impersonation yeah Adam Sandler could at least do the you know the the T. H. I. O. N. sound the shoal ... I mean at least you could do that okay yeah\nUm but ah the thing about Adam Sandler Cajun man and ... and this past weekend Cajun thing and I'm an expert on this 'cause I grew up there All right\nAnd you put a few beers and I'm Talking like that yeah oh man ...\nOkay so I Know how to do it and if you don't know how to do the Cajun accent don't it's like somebody doing\nA British accent that doesn't know how to do it and you can spotted a mile away exactly and to me that's what the SNL but it was all about they sounded ... I'll say I'll do I'll do their class sounded like fall corn langhorn\nYeah but couldn't decide if they wanted to be ... Louisiana or Georgia yeah yeah south Georgia or south Kentucky or yeah there'd be so yeah it yeah and\nI and I know that accent too 'cause my grandparents who are not changing but we're a descendant of the old\nSouth did have that kind of an old acts that I Do declare now go get them to the call and drive it real fall you know or how what is the news all the war I mean that's how they smoke that was the old southern accent that died with them and their generation Mm okay\nSo Saturday Night live doing this thing called liberal on your lap and blonde yep is just a word for extra a Baker's doesn't sometimes you go into a grocery store\nAnd you buy 'em you buy a dozen eggs and they'll give you two extra because the two extra Arlen yup measure that's on the up and ... just means my dear might but that's the that's the\nThe term of endearment so when you hear that from a cage and that is a term that does not cast and you're out it's a term of endearment it means they like you\nAnyway so I was that was griping about that yesterday just kinda like I Am now and dug then now set me on social media a clip and he's saying this was back when SNL was funny and he's right this is from Nineteen Seventy six and it is an attachment of a clip from YouTube when Joe Cocker\nAppeared on Saturday Night live sing and I'm feeling All right and who ... out on the stage during a Joe Cocker impersonation but John ah John Belushi\nAnd John Belushi has got a beer in his hand and he walks up to the Mike and even does it does one versus I'm feeling All right and it offers joker the beer and Joe Cocker just got to know [laughter] and that was a funny funny bit and\nDoug I agree I don't think Saturday Night live has been funny sense them or at least since Nineteen eighty\nSo I yeah but you don't cut the Eddie Murphy or something\nI don't count the Eddie Murphy yoga but even some of those fell flat you know the problem is Mike in on the love can and I think the problem is the first of all the number one problem with Saturday Night live always has been\nWriters behind the scenes and stars behind the scenes competing for camera time exactly if you're a bit isn't funny it doesn't make the show exactly and and and they're all jockeying backstage trying to get in on the okay yeah I Want to do this bit and and they tried to sell Lauren Michael's the producer on the bed\nAnd if he thinks it's funny it goes\nAnd then they also have back a bit so that they run late or run early they can pull the backup it and do that mhm I Know all that's going on behind but here's my point we don't have to reach that far to get funding material anymore I don't just type in puppies and YouTube and I'll get it does and shoot funny public videos\nAnd we're talking about this before and the reason why the comedy central shows especially when the Daily Show with John Stewart\nAnd the club ever poorer was with Stephen ... back when they exploded last decade yeah they got all the best comedy writers with her to political ear and knew where the jokes were\nBack then they weren't going to Saturday Night live they were going to their show and say that live suffered because and unfortunately Lorna Michael's got old he did he end or micro sense of humor is not mesh well with what people under forty\nOr anything right now people under forty aren't going to stay up all night on Saturday Night to get the comedy they can type in whatever they want to get in YouTube and get a a funny bit\nOn there and running or a bit on the anniversary show they did say that said that lived to show that your parents used to watch and no one night when they were dating yeah to not watch Sunday mornings on your phone\nThat's right I couldn't have said it better\nSo Doug thank you for sending

home Michael Bauer joining us a little later on to explain why we should care about this Saudi Arabian journalists to evidently was whacked in Turkey that's about thirty minutes\nBut I bet you didn't know there are a bunch of state questions coming up on the ballot now state question can be a number of things you can be a petition that was started by a bunch of concern voters it could be an amendment to the constitution it could be an amendment to a law that already exists that the legislature chose not to take care of\nIt could be something that the legislature did take care of\nAnd it needs a vote of the people be that as it may there will be five state questions on the ballot that you and I will need to decide to decide up or down on\nThe first one and you may have heard about this one is state question seven Ninety three it would allow I care facilities inside large retail stores like Wal Mart and target\nIf approved a it would amend the state constitution to allow optometrist and opticians to practice in retail or end retailers and allow the legislature to regulate them basically you'd be able to go into Walmart and get your taxes down and your eyes jacked in one place\nI've lived in three states where this is the the deal and nobody was put out of business\nI see no problem with it I'm voting yes on seven Ninety three but by the way it's not just Wal Mart and target Costco wants to see this happen and a lot of other large retailers\nSo I I see no problem with it here's the other thing you go to an optimum up I'm Tom interest\nOr not petition you get your eyes jak they give you a prescription you should be able to go elsewhere and get your\nGlasses and I'm not sure if that's the case here but it certainly doesn't appear to be because\nEvery time I go to get my eyes to okay now here's what you got to pick out well wait a minute what if I got what if I Want to order them oh I Know you can't do that\nAnd maybe that's just my optician being a jerk but [noise] next\nQuestion is seven Ninety four\nIt's called Marci law it's a measure that guarantees certain rights for crime victims\nIt is an initiative that was started back in Nineteen eighty three after a marsh scene Nicholas the California college student was allegedly stopped and killed by her ex boyfriend a week later Marcy smother ran into him at the grocery store and had no idea he'd been released on bail\nMartial law has been enacted in five states and if approved it would among other things require victims to be notified and be heard and most criminal proceedings to prohibit unreasonable delay of criminal cases\nAgain I see no problem with this\nIf someone is done you wrong and you turn right around and they're out on bail you should know that they're out on bail\nState question seven Ninety four I think I Will vote yes on it\n[noise] stay question seven Ninety eight would allow candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to run on a joint ticket much like US President and vice president\nCandidate for governor and lieutenant governor in Oklahoma currently are separately elected meaning candidates from different political parties could hold the state's top two officers\nThat proposal pass out of the legislature earlier this year would not take effect until twenty twenty six but I Will remind you the issue did come up in a hour from now on debate that was held a last week\nThe students wanted to know why don't we do it that way [noise]\nI uh I live in states where you did have a joint governor ... governor and then I Lived in states where it's like we do here I I don't see a big difference\nI think that's a very very good exercise Eric and I think everybody should do that and it's easy enough to do go to and I don't have this up as we get closer to the election go to the election board website the state election board website you type in your ZIP Code\nAnd I think your name and then it'll pull up a ballot of everything that's going to be on your ballot when you go into your polling place\nScott is in Oklahoma City on his radio in thousand Katie okay Hi\nHi how are they I think he's got but um yeah I my brother\nMy thumb on the other raised up a point that I don't know the answer to the onset Ninety three uh-huh and I don't know where they got the information but they are saying that the requirement for that time a dress for the wall Mart type stores or target\nLast in that regard for Hama trees ... either uh well that market now I just thought I'd be like no that's true or not or would you find that\nOut I Would have to go and look that up because I don't know what the regulations are for optometrist who and and uh\nUh who have their own office or I imagine there's some equipment that won't be available to them I imagine there are some uh but but still still Scott I mean for people who can't or don't want to afford\nA big time optometrist I don't see why they can't just go you know go into into the into the Walmart I don't that again I Lived in states where we've had this and it's not that big a deal\nIt's competitive for the optometrist I Know that\nThey'll lose their um ah their monopoly on the business\nWell my question is if if there are going to go to that ... and we may be cheaper even a and they're not their requirements for their certification is that would be kind of a red flag to me when do you\nWell then then I won't go if that's the case but I don't see any problem with there being a freedom for ah for for people to set up shop there are\nUnder current system I've gone to telling the truth is that we're not as good as up to I was younger I had it in the past yeah and so on that issue there were great ones and mediocre ones now and\nAnd I don't see how it's any different than now I Will tell you this I started going to ... and twenty fourteen\nShe sold the practice to another set of optometrist who then sold it to another set of optometrist and this last time I went two weeks ago it was the third different doctor that I'd been to who bought that practice\nSo I don't know what's going on that they didn't hang onto the practice I don't see how that is any different than me going down to Walmart when I Need to get my checked once a year\nNow the other thing is with my insurance pay for that ... probably not mine maybe some other insurers would

the task that generates lab so they can contact prescription and ignore a lot of the house checking the\nAnd this is totally opposed to why our profession has been going for the last ... years\n... has become more and more medically oriented\nService our patients while and attacked a disease and and help prevent\nHeart disease or minimize the result\nAnd if these while on march aren't allowed to influence the doctor I hold in their contract over their heads and saying you got to say that they will die why can't do that and do a good job for the ... well then you'd better cut out some things ...\nAh it this way comparable to the doctors and others that are associated with Wal Mart or the ... the doctors are still responsible for checking all the\nAll the health issues for the high okay one of the race is not what why Wal Marts and chat and it was because in other states that are being class action suits were more martyrs birds undue pressure on the doctors to knock the hell tracks and the doctors have risen up and say hey this isn't rocked\nYeah well I can I can certainly agree with that Ken I mean if it hadn't been for the primary care of my optometrist in a brick and mortar practice of their own my cataract wouldn't have been detected or my um genetic ... which I have on the back of my eyes and and I would not have and and\nI actually would not have been able to figure find out through them that uh it's not that serious but uh I'm a yeah from from from that point here's\nWhat fashion wouldn't really have any right to object\nTo the doctors at Walmart we're going to practice under the same rules and same authority from the Oklahoma border the examiner that we have to practice for it but this would ultimately change our state constitution and take away the board authority to regulate these doctors\nAnd put it under under the rules that Wal Mart decides to contract the doctors or\nOkay that's the big objection optometry has about it\nWell I can certainly see that uh can I I actually can so uh you have to decide when you're in the voting booth what's important to you is it important to you to get glasses quicken inexpensively or is it important for you for optometrist to be able to spot things like\nCataract and Andrew version and and and other things that they would then refer you to a a a a specialist over\nA and and that's what you need to figure out a for Olin thousand STAR One thousand and he's ready one thousand Katie okay Travis is widely Matthews Hi\nHello I'm a I'm an optometrist uh okay I Want to add to what Ken fed\nThis would make Oklahoma the only state in the union that would have this type of restrictions on atomic dress and limiting their practice within a commercial establishment the only one and so uh other states have actually\nJoined in in this fight because they don't want this to spread to their state of the public should not have to decide what kind of quality they want on their eye exam that's that's that's not really possible and in fact there just to standards of care\nYou know if this goes through yeah and the board examiners whose responsibility is to protect the public will have a dilemma the oven Tobar fortunate because they ... there's no way to resolve that once it's in the constitution of can never be changed right so that's that's what I'm saying it's gonna it's not going to be quality care\nOr we're going to have many problems similar to the medical marijuana issue where once it's in there you have to work around it but you can't really make changes\nWell thank you for a for chime in both you and Ken Travis on who's ready one thousand cagey okay and again you have to decide in the voting\nBooth what's important to you or what that state question to more items that I wanted to get to and will in just a minute on who's ready one thousand Katie okay right now I wanted to get with Michael Bauer and bill ... who are with our twenty four seven news division of our parent company I hearts media\nTrump met with secretary of state Mike Pompeo this morning Michael er but did he learn anything more about this a case involving ... then we already knew from days ago\nThat you have to be determined right now we know that ah the details coming out from that ... both Trump and palm pay are continuing to defend Saudi Arabia they're both kind of thing at this point they want to see the end of the investigation be at the Turkish end of the investigation\nThe Saudi Arabian end of the investigation um some mixed signals that we're seeing right now in regards to what palm pilot came back with I remember he had a short and meeting with a Saudi Arabia's crown prince which we're hearing from sources he told him that\nHe had to own the situation the crown prince did it at every fact is going to get out sort of a heads up and just be warned that when this all does come out things might have to change so to get out ahead of this as much as you possibly can we also know that President Trump still sort of in that defense mode where\nHe's trying to say that he's not covering for Saudi Arabia at all he wants to know what happened he wants to know where the fault lies he says they'll probably know by the end of the week but I think what really is holding everything up here and and this would be sort of the the tell all to this is\nIf indeed the Turkish officials were able to release the audio footage that they have and that they have been frankly in their newspaper their state run newspaper\nBeen releasing ... they've been they've been uh putting into paper they've been putting it out and print it's been indicative of the torture that allegedly could show he went through the minute he walked through the door and the Saudi council it where he had fingers severed in a torturing before\nHe was beheaded and dismembered and within a two hour time frame those killers work on according to reports but one of the people that they did recognize via his voice\nWas the council general for the Saudi Arabian embassy there and uh that council told these agents who were working on the show gave to do it outside because they would be putting him in trouble and according to the Turkish official that's when one of those agents sit at the council general if you want to live when you come back\nIt's a Saudi Arabia shut up now that's what also that took U.S officials are using to search the council general's office we saw yesterday on the news every literally worldwide or the Turkish investigated wearing their hazmat suits\nSeized on the Saudi council general's residence yesterday and ... but that was only after trying for two weeks to get into their unable to do so until that general counsel fled the country two days ago and went back to Saudi Arabia\n[noise] okay so the Turks are evidently have no love lost for the Saudi Arabians in or want to get to the bottom of this\nYeah and and frankly listen to it\nBut not exactly friends let's put it that way but I also don't think they necessarily want to come out on the side of being enemies of Saudi Arabia at this point and it seems as though there are certainly historically\nNumerous questions into what we can believe from from Turkish officials on any level but listen this happened in their country this is their investigation and this was not a direct\nLink to the U.S on any level so you've got now the Saudis conducting their own investigation that were sort of just waiting to hear and see what that information is although we are being told from Turkish officials that while this is an ongoing investigation expected to be concluded soon and they'll say Turkish officials are saying that there is growing indications and according to them video evidence\nThat the men allegedly responsible for the journalist has close ties to Saudi Government highest levels of Saudi Government so\nThat's something that's going to have to be answered for here as well and it seems as though everybody is literally holding their thoughts and statements back in that Saudi was supposed to Saudi Arabia is we're supposed to issue a statement\nSome three days ago now they have issued no statement on this whatsoever they had been quiet on this in my guess is that until they see what happens at the end of this investigation of what actual evidence is out there\nOn the builds him for a for another angle on this story and a bill I guess let me just play devil's advocate why should we care if some guy went to turkey and got whacked\nWell I think what adds a whole nother aspect to this lady is that he was a resident of the United states a was a columnist for the Washington Post and that adds a whole nother angle to this you know in the past uh we haven't been able to overlook\nA some things from Saudi Arabia like public executions and a human rights alleged human rights abuses and the treatment of women\nIf approved five percent of the collections from the gross production tax that we charge oil businesses\nWould be deposited into us on the big Indian twenty twenty the amount would increase by point two percent each year\nSupporters like Mike Jackson executive for a president of government and political affairs for the state chamber say that about twenty million to thirty five million would likely be put into a fund each year depending on oil prices and it's supposed to insulate state agencies from the up and down that we see\nFrom oil prices and our oil revenues\nNo more than five percent of the vision fund could be used for service payments due to bonds or other financing instruments four percent of the average annual principle Bloody Bloody bloody block my only question is I thought we already had a ... like this set up and I thought it was called the rainy day fund\nBox\nI may be overdosing and oversimplifying\nNo this is basically as a secondary rainy day fund is that you had to cater to schools and education\nWell and it would be and it would be based upon the oil industry coming and so the the price of oil as high then will a lot of money will come into the front of the price of the oil is low are not as much so\nI've asked a bunch of times what we can do to insulate ourselves from the ups and downs of the oil market this may be one of those again I think I met a coin flip on that one but I'm definitely not of the coin flip on the next one state question ...\nWhat it is what it means I'll tell you an extra news radio on thousand Katie okay Beth Myers is in the news room where a vice president Mike Pence was in Tulsa today
