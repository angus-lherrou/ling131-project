expensive to do that sort of thing you're competing with other crops so the people who study these things on an actress agriculture economics basis or not as sanguine as the industry on the other hand you know people\nLike beer and the industry has a pretty innovative won in some way so you know maybe they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry about it\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer at one of the authors of the study even said not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitions air pollution deaths anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're messing with my beer and you know everybody's interested in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nThis month of October I been putting in little stories and the podcast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level of Halloween that I Love to get every year the one that caught my attention this past week\nWas that any child vampire burial that was found in Italy in some type of baby cemetery there was this eerie discovery ... they found it was the skeleton of a ten year old that had\nA rock lodged in his mouth they buried this child is way because they were afraid it was gonna come back to life and contain the spread malaria I spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this\nEmpire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university to Stanford\nWent on this dig in Italy and they found this\nChild cemetery and so inside of a miniature him in what used to be a gigantic\nRoman villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall if you can think about it like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with its mouth open and stuffed inside a limestone rock\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said they believed the child\nDied of malaria sixty miles north of round and they said that the way that they buried this kid let's say ... they ... already dead they opened\nThe mouse forcefully shoved the rock inside and then failed that extra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the rock wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead because of those same impression right locally or they're calling it the vampire of little nano it's in this like you said is in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called the London properly they bend beanie\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in this very will say you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of a ... in these trenches they're covered trenches\nThere was a remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents total bones ROMs called dreams these things were filled with ash and sacrificial puppies\nYeah archaeologist call these deviant burials which is the ancient way of burying people who were they feared would have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead or that the where people and I I don't know how this would apply to children but that had violated society's rules and the name of empire ...\nAnd a lot of these archaeologists and researchers saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know what it was or why it was popping up and things that they feared they thought might come back from the day that thought they were vampires that's why they\nTook these extra steps to bury them this way so that they couldn't come back and continue to spread diseases\nAnd they would do all kinds of things like that were rituals Reynolds he didn't say they would dump honey suck all all over the place and these were just to kind of try to make it as your as possible so that these spirits we'll just pass along and not come back\nWe don't know the gender of this ten year old the skeleton that was there but they said that near this one was a three year old girl the the remains were thrilled girl they found\nThat said there her hands and feet had been way down with stones which was another form of vampire burial to keep the evil away so that she couldn't get up they were able to dig in into the bones and the remains and they also found that she had died of malaria\nAnd they're saying that the reason why there are so many children's bodies that they had done extensive research on to find out yeah they all died for malaria is because it's Roman Empire section was considered to be a cesspool of diseases and they spread it through\nContaminated food and water and it was pretty swampy so they're a ton of mosquitoes and that's why there was so much malaria up until they pretty much figured it out in the Eighteen hundreds\nThis is not the only sight of these quote unquote vampire\nBurials yeah in northern Italy there was a woman who's buried with a brick in her mouth almost the same thing like the ... you know a shape rock but this was a British huge too you know she was dubbed the vampire of Venice and England there was another guy who had his tongue taken out and replaced with a stone\nSo it just seemed like that was one of the populace methods are popular rituals to keep them from being able to come back from the\nDead but that guy in England is fascinating because clearly in the year two hundred these people are talking to each other so somewhere these people in England nearer to do this exact same type of ... and the people in northern Italy or doing at the same time\nYeah it's interesting just what people will do when you fear or something you don't know how to control or react to it you go through these extra steps these rituals and label them which isn't vampires and things like that so\nIt's just pretty creepy that they would do that to a small child but when you're scared of something you're going to do those extra steps to protect yourself making

the U.S they walk\nFor about twelve hours a day and ended here in the town square of ...\nI don't think so and and my example is myself I come from I guess you'd call generation X. people who graduated in the late eighties throughout the nineties\nMost of us didn't grow up with Internet or anything related to the Internet\nBut my generation adapted to work this Internet based very quickly and that same generation had a lot to do with the Internet boom and so my take is that as\nIt is it's always the case people can learn they learn quickly what they need to learn in order to be employed and and what brings them into employment is that\nCompanies looking to add quality workers raise the amount that they're willing to pay\nAnd that serves as a fairly potent lower so I never worry about that skills people can develop skills very quickly\nYou mentioned one of the areas where the president maybe is not as free market as other places is when it comes to trade\nWe have a new NAFTA agreement and although I understand\nYou don't have a crystal ball what effect do you think having an agreement actually in place now will have on trade\nIt's good in the sense that it removes some uncertainty certainly the markets like that probably what they would have liked a lot more is if President Trump hadn't done anything investors broadly like NAFTA and so\nThe fact that the good news here is that it didn't bringing it back Trump largely brought back but we had before there was a bit more central planning to it and that's unfortunate there's lots of things like certain cars are going to be made and sold in North America tear free they\nI have to have a certain amount of labor that constantly sixteen dollars per hour the inputs in the car have to add a percentage of I think Seventy five percent be made\nA North America that's unfortunate that the Republican Party has historically been one about free markets and freedom for producers to do is they wish without\nMeddling there is a little bit of central planning and the new NAFTA but largely at the same as the one before and investors broadly\nLike that but let's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of course of her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact that has a just very briefly but what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have on our economy and how does to try to manage it\nWell I'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed in I wrote a book about it called who needs the fat I I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exists as a lender of last resort to solvent banks but it can't really do that you know solving bank would ever go to the fed for alone and be an admission of bankruptcy\nThe fat also regulates banks but it can't really do that very effectively as two thousand eight reminds us and then of course it aims to\nSet the overnight rate which banks lend to one another button interest rates of price like any other you don't need the fed for that and so I think the feds impact has vastly over and people say well you know they're going to reduce interest rates and that's going to use that credit\nThat's the equivalent of married ablaze you sane in New York how apartment rents are too high I'm going to reduce how much landlords couldn't charge for apartments all he would do is just cause scarcity and the same way of markets actually responded the fed\nThe fed to the best cause scarcity by trying to artificially lower rates below what they would normally hit in the marketplace so my point is is is we in the real economy we largely act as though the fat doesn't exist that that sort of an ... that sort of an outlier position\nBut I Believe it will be increasingly common place in the coming years\nThe fed has been on a rate increase I won't say binge because they've been doing it in smaller increments this past week it did seem to get her the markets a little bit will the fed raising the the rates will that caused the economy to cool off or given your previous comment cereal really don't think it's going to have much impact in the long run\nNow I don't think it will have much of an impact at all\nLet's remember the fact kept rates low mountains here or the rate at at him set for years and years for basically two thousand nine until what about twenty Fifteen or twenty sixteen\nThere was no major economic boom during that time the fed can change reality when when we're when we go to the market to borrow money we're borrowing access to real resources to trucks tractors computers desks chairs most of all human labor that that can expand the amount of that available I Can't make\nThese resources cheap and so I think the answer is is to always remind ourselves with the fat as just another entity trying to influence things not very well\nWe have been talking with John Tammy who is the director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks John tells a bit about freedomworks also working folks go on the Web to get more information from you\nFreedomworks is a wonderful organization based in Washington DC that makes the essential point that Washington is not going to change in less politicians realize that they're the voters are changing that they basically see what they're dealing\nAnd your website is W. W. W. freedomworks dot org John Tammany up freedomworks John thank you for being here thanks for having me\nAndy route that the club for growth keeping an eye on what's been a fascinating last few weeks in the nation's capital to say the least dandy good to have you here Hi thanks for having me lemon Brett Kavanaugh's now an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states\nBut the political ramifications likely are going to be felt for weeks as we head into the general election Andy is the Kavanaugh confirmation process is this going to be an overall plots for Republicans\nWell it is so far I mean obviously we get a a conservative justice that will help make the court\nOf conservative majority that could last very long time and who knows Trump may even get another pick before the end of his first term but with regards to politics there's evidence that Republican voter enthusiasm has picked up you saw some recent polls that showed\nThat the percentage of voters who think this election is very important [noise] used to be D plus ten meaning the Democrats are ten percent more enthusiastic to vote the Republicans\nAnd that has shrunk to D plus too since they have in a fight so if for Republicans show up at the polls was just as much enthusiasm as Democrats\nThan the Republicans will keep the house and they will likely add to the Senate majority so the cabinet thing has a big deal and let me point out that the Democrats want to politicize it to the Jerry ... a house Democrat\nHe said that if the Democrats are in charge he will be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and he said his first thing will be to invest the Kavanaugh and I assume the next thing they do is going to try and impeached Trump so that they're going to certainly keep Republican\nVoters motivated to to make sure that doesn't happen\nSo it's it's an odd thing when both parties agree to fight over the same issue\nCabinet of course as you mentioned here is going to be a major issue heading into the election seems to be really energizing Republicans of course the Democrats were if you follow the conventional wisdom Andy energized anyhow so that they need Kavanaugh is probably a ... a net plus for Republicans but Andy\nUsually as Jim Carville once famously said it's the economy stupid so let's talk for a second in our interview just prior to our discussion we talked about the fact that unemployment is at the lowest abs since Nineteen sixties the economy is urging shouldn't this be a\nNet loss for Republicans\nYes it should and I think it it is I think it is helping them like you said on Portman is at a fifty year low I mean I think that's absolutely remarkable for those of us who have lived during the Reagan boom years\nAnd the Clinton boom years and the first part of the George Bush boom years this is better than all of those the unemployment rates down to three point seven percent which is a remarkable statistic\nAnd Trump is getting very little credit for that\nNow granted Trump is getting in his own way\nUh with his tariffs they are holding the economy back a little bit and that's unfortunate if he were able to get rid of those\nI think the economy would soar even higher and then one thing that isn't his fault is the Federal Reserve is\nRaising interest rates as they should because rates have been artificially low for a decade since the financial crisis so it's well past time that that the rate started joining up the good news though is that you want to raise rates\nDuring an an an economy so that it doesn't get overheated and so that you can just have a steady climb up words so my hope is that that's exactly what we're experiencing now\nIn a ... a few short weeks\nPeople are going to vote with their pocket I don't know if that will be the overwhelming thing that makes their decision but when they know that they're getting a steady paycheck and things are looking good voters tend to vote that way and and they support the people who helped make that happen\nThe Democrat playbook since the economy is going so well for Republicans Andy seems to be to try and put the focus back on healthcare I personally live with the congressional district that's highly competitive there are a lot of scare ads being put out by Democrats and they seem to be wanting to focus on the whole issue of pre existing conditions\nReason magazine and the author of the book the end of doom environmental renewal and the twenty\nFirst century around just about a minute or so left here but let's I I'm just curious for your thoughts on

right back here next week on another edition of American radio journal\nCivility was the biggest casualty of the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings on this American radio journal commentary colonel Frank Ryan us embassy retired says it's time for elected officials to begin acting more like statesman\nIn the past month to extraordinarily different yet related events played out in the American landscape one was a headline where's the other was just a footnote\nTo first event the confirmation process for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh exploded infuriating the American media and in public discourse to second event was the announcement of the awarding of the medal of honor\nTo sergeant major John Kennedy for his heroism in Vietnam decades earlier I was honored to receive an invitation to the sergeant majors award ceremony from my sergeant major Eddie nice the medal of honor is bestowed on those individuals\nWho I quote conspicuously by downed tree and interpreted the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty unquote surf was self sacrifice and without regard to their own life virtually every American respects the medal of honor and a significant self sacrifice\nThat the award conveys it is this concept of self sacrifice while revered\nIs missing some noticeably from our society today I'm certain that are selfish preoccupation with instant tiniest gratification have caused many of the problems we as a society face sergeant major can we fought valiantly in the battlefield to Vietnam and\nIs finally being recognized for self sacrifice and devotion to duty his personal bravery serves as an example of what leadership is all about and reflects great credit upon himself\nHis unit the United States Marine corps and the naval services on the other hand the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh was the epitome of some of the most disgraceful conduct\nEver exhibited by the United states senators and the history of our nation while associate justice\nKavanaugh did not faced bullets are emitted death he was most certainly assaulted in the most offensive ways possible by those who are supposed to support and defend the constitution of the United states of America\nThose very senators knew all too well the judge was not protected against defamation because of the case of the New York times versus solving in other words politicians in public figures\nHave little recourse to slanderous conduct a less actual ... says proven it is an almost impossible standard to prove which means that the judge by accepting the nomination to the court\nHad to be willing to subject himself and his family too horrific conduct by those opposed to his views if a nation is ever going to attempt to rebuild itself the very character of the nation must emphasize selflessness a moral code of decency\nAnd personal responsibility our national character as represented by great heroes like sergeant major can really is under assault\nThis battle is more than just the battle for Supreme Court nomination is about the very struggle for survival of the freedoms that we espouse in the bill of rights and for which sergeant major can really and millions of others fought all of us in the military and government take the same oath of office to support and defend\nThe constitution of the United states of America the conduct of the senators attacking Kavanaugh on here saying in your window\nFor political gain was disgraceful\nThose senators victimized justice Kevin ... Dr Ford and all of us for political gain\nA different type of battle equally as important to when justice Kavanaugh fought to protect the very fabric of the constitution he has sworn to defend find not backing down he convinced me of his moral courage in the face of unwavering criticism or the primary underpinnings in any civilized society is the presumption of innocence\nThis nonsense that the presumption of innocence did not apply because it was a job\nInterview is a travesty is a travesty inflicted by the opposing side a pundit very character\nOf a person and our nation it was a sad day for our entire nation and those of us who fought\nTo defend this nation and our constitution your bill of rights and common law the sheer ... of their arguments fell on deaf ears of those of us who had to defend while in the military the character of our nation and our people elected leaders of which I Am now one have a responsibility to be statesmen first\nAnd politicians second to travesty of the conduct of those opposing Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cast shame and dishonor on the institution which they were elected to serve\nFortunately others in the Senate stood firm\nAnd upheld the societal framework of the presumption of innocence those brave senators withstood tremendous pressure to conform to very precepts of the constitution that they had been sworn to uphold when a nation centered citizens into combat and into the military\nIt as a moral responsibility to support and defend that same constitution the military supported in harm's way whereas elected leaders are obligated to support the constitution and the halls of Congress both arenas are critical if our nation is just survive only through our emphasis on self sacrifice moral courage\nAnd a personal accountability where our nation survive our founding fathers left us a wonderful legacy what we do with that legacy is our decision an hour or so alone for the American radio journal this is Frank Ryan\nAmerican radio journal is hurt on public affairs minded radio stations all across the country they include W.
