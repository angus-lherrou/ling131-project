{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "And everybody else is out there believing that they are investing because they believe that savings and saving is investing\nBut putting money in a four one K. are putting money in Iowa re or putting in a savings account\nIs not investing in your future is not building income stream it is not building businesses it's not helping society at all it's not helping you at All right and when you get done just shove your money in your pocket the end of the day the only amount of money of love your box what you don't spend\nBut not spending money does it make you more money you have to invest so I'm going to sugars rather comical little spiel with you\n[noise] uh somebody said to me because I think it actually identified that situation [noise] this is a conversation between a husband and her wife\nAnd a husband and wife and the wife has a has been you drink beer husband said yes women says how many beers a day man says usually about three women says how much do you pay per beer man says about five bucks which includes a tip\nThe woman says and how long have you been drinking man says about Twenty years I suppose\nWoman says so a beer cost five bucks and you have three a day which put your spending each month at four hundred and fifty dollars in one year would be approximately five thousand four hundred dollars correct and the map the man does some math and Cisco can correct\nAnd the woman says if a one year you spent fifty four hundred dollars not accounting for inflation the past Twenty years would put your spending it one hundred eighty thousand dollars correct\nIt matches after some calculations correct the woman's as do you know\nThat if you didn't drink so much beer that money could have been put in a stepped up interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest for the Twenty years you would have a\n... you could have had a new airplane and the man looks at the woman and says do you drink beer\nAnd knew him and goes and do you look through the face and says where's your airplane [laughter]\nYou're gonna have to think about that would that would do get to go in so easy because it's not about her husband or wife arguing it's about the logic that living without actually makes your life\nBetter but it doesn't\nAnd if you really look at it shows you that airplane that's even dumber cause your plane would cause even more money so the entire conversation which has put together I Believe originally be considered a husband wife type joke about I mentioned the money and how women see money\nIt really defined society you believe out there in your world that if you say five bucks\nIf you save a hundred bucks a thousand bucks a month it's going to add up to something and then you're going to be able to buy crap with it what is crap anything in life you don't need but what you really need is not the ability to buy a piece of crap all a plane car jet ski boat\nYou need to have a regular reoccurring stream of income that you can retire on\nThat you can grow into the future so you can afford to buy is Mitch is many toys or as much crap use my vernacular as many toys as you want to buy and still not have to get up and go to work but nowhere did the lady say if you had all that money you could take a month off\nOr you might be able to have an investment in an apartment where did you could retire for the rest of your life you see the jokes can't even get that close to the reality of what it takes to become successful here's a wife ditching or husband out about being wasteful and not having financial success because he drinks beer\nAnd those bills\nHey America all you guys out there talking about how great it is to save money and your four one K. and your IRA and your savings ... and ... billion college fund all that money out there and all those accounts is it making you financially free is making you happy\nAre you being able to retire in the answer to all the above questions is no no no no\nYou my friends have nothing\nJust like the lady who doesn't drink beer where's your plane my friends or in other words where's your investments that will retire you wear has your wealth gone that you should have had because of all the working and sacrificing you've done in your entire life\nMy proposition is it was never there in the first place\nBecause working for a living is not the secret to becoming financially free it's not the secret to becoming wealthy and it's not going to be the secrets is going to allow you to retire\nIn any year in the near future\nMy friends I beg you please change the way you see the world because as how you see the world is you a real problem as Einstein said and if you keep doing

sixteen hundreds it was an except the truth that all swans are white in fact all salons are white had been used for a long time as the standard example of a scientific truth\nThe equivalent today might be the earth rotates around the sun today we'd call that an indisputable scientific truth\nSo what were the odds of seeing a black swan at that time\nWell impossible to calculate but are considered impossible until sixteen Ninety seven when explores found black swans and Australia imagine that they had a black swan event finding black swans in Australia when that was considered impossible\nAs I mentioned earlier we had a black swan event in two thousand one didn't wait [noise]\nAnd we're having many others these days\nOr if you live in the ah Oklahoma City area like I Do a you know all about the earthquakes the other day I think we had five in one day\nA and there's volcanoes not here but elsewhere terrorist strikes as you know and so on the chances of black swan events today seem much higher than just a decade or two ago and yet many people continue to invest\nAs though the twenty five year bull market of Nineteen eighty two to two thousand seven is in full force again and we'll continue forever with no significant black swan events along the way\nDoesn't it seem a bit odd so let me ask you a question how would you like a guaranteed first year return of up to

fact after considering all the fees that you may have paid as possible your account has actually decreased over the last several years\nThe good news is that the elevator rarely dropped without stopping on a few floors along the way the problem is that hardly anybody ever gets off the elevator or maybe they hope it'll start going back up that's kind of like the gambler that's waiting for the

many people buying a home is one of the largest purchases they will ever make\nWhat risk do you have when you buy out for one you have risk of market value lost a lot of people learn that in two thousand eight right many people thought that there was no significant risks\nFrom home values going down but that perception has now changed and what about risk of property loss flood fire and those dreaded earthquakes that we seem to have every five minutes around here when storms and that\nThere are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment other properties you don't have the same risks if you own a car about an airplane\nIf you're on an airplane or about my condolences but anyway if you own any other property with significant value there is a risk of loss when you're on something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you probably know the answer insurance right\nInsurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they were probably never used so why would you buy insurance on your home\nYou might say well I have a loan on my home so I have to buy insurance on it while that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for would you still buy insurance I think you probably would why\nWhether you realize it or not you would buy insurance on your home because of something called catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that you have a chance even if it a small to lose a lot of value in other words money\nIf something bad happens the reason we buy insurance\nOn our homes is because the cost of insurance is very small\nCompared to the last we might incur if a catastrophe happens so for the fun of it let's let's assume you live in a modern home up to current building 'cause you don't smoke and fall asleep in your bed you don't light candles and leave them unattended\nAnd you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen if I'm describing you there's a very small chance your house is going to catch on fire even so I bet you have home insurance and the reason is because losing your house\nWould be a catastrophic financial last so the relatively small cost of homeowners insurance is worth paying for am I right well you know I'm right\nBut let me ask you another question why don't you have insurance on your retirement money shouldn't you shouldn't

[noise]\nMoney [noise]\nRadio [noise]\nNow back to more safe money radio with your host very cold and\nWelcome back I'm Derek ... your host of safe money radio I'm a save money retirement specialist working with science right here and the Oklahoma City area\nSo here's a question I'd like to ask you how much of your money is currently in the market and all of it fifty percent eighty percent did you make a conscious decision to have that particular percentage\nExposed to market risk or did it did it just sort of a happen\nWhy am I asking well as I've said before the markets go up and as we all know they come back down how much of your life savings that is exposed to market risk is a very important consideration and that's why I strongly encourage everyone to think of their money in terms of red money and green money\nThose terms might sound funny but but I think they'll help but help us understand a very important concept so let me explain red money is money that we're willing to exposed market risk in hopes of a higher return\nWe accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater gains red money's exposed the upside and downside market risk with green money were not willing to accept the risk of loss\nSo we're willing to accept a lower return and exchange green money does not have downside market risk\nSo Fred money's exposed to upside an downside market risk and green money has only upside market potential which one is better well that's probably the wrong question to be asking\nBecause neither one is inherently good or bad at it all depends they're very important question we should ask ourselves with these what percentage of my money should be in red money and what percentage of my money should be hungry money\nIf you're at or near retirement you should ask yourself if any of your money should be in red money I mean can you afford to lose any of your retirement funds\nWould you rather take two steps forward and three steps back or just take one step at a time and never take a step back\nWell that's what we do here and save money and if you'd like to learn how to step forward and never backward call for our safe money book and information get that could change your financial life for the better again our number is eight seven seven five for eight safe that's eight seven seven\nFive for eight seven to three three there's no cost or obligation\nLet me tell you what red money is good for it's good for the young ... good for the rich the young half time on their side and can afford to lose money in hopes that they'll make it back in the future they're rich can afford to lose at least some of their money and still live comfortably\nBut if you're at or near retirement you should definitely be in the grain which is money that cannot be lost due to market declines many people believe that all retirement money should be green money personally um I think that makes a lot of sense\nDepending of course on on your situation but many people I work with regardless of age want a hundred percent green money because they know they can have upside market participation with out except in any downside market risk\nIsn't it time for you to go green with your retirement give me a call at eight seven seven five for a safe eight seven seven five for eight seven to three three and a will show you how that is not not only can you have some upside growth linked to markets without any downside market risk but you can get a first\nA bonus of up to eight percent on all of your money just for opening the

years what we've learned is that having green money provides an enormous benefit\n[noise] and that is a tremendous sense of comfort in relief for the person making the decision [noise] think about that the worry the stress goes away just think if you have read many losses and get upset probably the money should not have been in red money\n[noise] so this makes it easy to decide you ask yourself this question if I were to lose some most or all of the money in this account would I be upset\nIf the answer is yes then your money should be in a green money account\nYou may be asking yourself what

Fox News Washington grappling with the issue of whether to continue arms sales to Saudi Arabia after a Washington Post columnist your mouth to show the disappeared inside the Saudi conflict in eastern bowling is feared dead former UN ambassador Bill Richardson\nAnd this is Fox News [noise]\nOur radio\n[noise]\nWelcome to the daily diet weekend edition I'm Oscar remarried and every week my producer Moran in I explore the top stories making waves in the news and some that are just plain interesting we connected with the journalists people\nKnow the story and bringing you news without the noise so you can make an informed decision\nYou can catch a new episode of the daily dies every Monday through friday and it's ready when you wake up\nOn the weekend edition brewery bringing some of the best stories from the week [noise]\nOne of the biggest stories of the week was that of hurricane Michael there was a second time in just recent times that the u._s. was subjected to hurricanes we just got over Florence recovery efforts are still going on in the Carolinas\nAnd then hurricane Michael comes around and hits the Florida Panhandle I mean the trail of devastation stretches from there from the Florida Panhandle through Georgia all the way down to the Carolinas again\nIt's we can to a tropical storm but it's still triggered flash floods and turn roads into rivers and wiped out a whole coastal town a Miranda what do we know about the latest with hurricane Michael\nYeah there are calling the category for storm historic and there were at least seven deaths attributed to Michael including an eleven year old girl who local officials say was killed when part of the metal carport crashed into her family's mobile home and\nThat was in lake seminal Georgia and the thirty eight year old man who was killed when a tree fell on his moving car in states bill north Carolina\nThere's tons of people without power one point one million customers in six states without power all of this is subject to change\nWhat we did in the beginning of the week as the storm is approaching we spoke to science editor at ... Andrew Freedman he's the\nExtreme weather expert we asked them why the storm intensified so quickly as it was before and it was weakening before it hit this one on the other hand Michael intensified right before it hits so we talked to him about why it intensified and why we're seeing more extreme weather events\nIt was an extraordinary rapid intensification rate this is something that forecasters have a lot of trouble with\n... with Hurricane Florence when Florence went through a period of ... the computer models caught it ahead of time with this one we knew the signs were there\nBut it seems to be having a little bit of trouble overcoming two factors why some weight and share which was disrupting the score and score and was blocked these huge thunderstorms in the atmosphere only to lose the top of them to the strong wind and then the other one was a visit dry air\nThat had hoped ingested that was disrupting circulation at some point on Tuesday night it\nSuddenly seemed to come free from the grip the vote was holding it back and just when gang busters for several hours really transformed itself into a very ugly storm very beautiful nature logically speaking but ugly for Floridians and\nJust kept going what we normally see our storms that approach the Florida Panhandle and weaken\nAs they near last this what did the opposite it was\nThey intensify as it cross the beach\nThe news obviously plays up a lot of these weather events have reporters walking and flooded areas and standing in the wind in the rain just to\nIllustrate what's going on so people in other parts of the country know what's going on there is that but there is the scientific consensus that extreme weather is on the rise why are we seeing more of these big weather events\nAs we said with foreign ... it was huge and that was falling out and it was doing all this crazy stuff the same thing with this one it intensified in the last few moments before it made landfall\nWhat is going on with all these extreme weather events\nWe know that we have more extreme weather events that are becoming more intense and more frequent with climate change plain and simple that is particularly cake with heat wave and heavy precipitation events it's not as clear hot with hurricanes what scientists thinker\nIs happening and have demonstrated in studies is that they are becoming weather really they're producing more rainfall on average and they are either already\nGetting stronger or expected to seem more high and hurt\nSo you might have fewer hurricanes in a season but a bigger percentage of them is going to be a cat for that but now that matters a lot because the the couch for ... five storms because most of the ...\nWith both Florence and with the current storm you had both storms go through periods of rapid intensification that mean that it intensified by about thirty five miles an hour or greater in twenty four hours this far exceeded\nThat baseline definition of what we think we made\n... and I say we meaning the climate community and as somebody who covers the community I pay way but really\nIt's the scientists who are doing the work and they're saying to me we think we might be seeing a trend towards more frequent wrap it in the kitchen that the real forecast challenge because if that's going to be happening more frequently you could go to sleep\nThinking you're going to get hit by a category one and wake up\nThe hit by a category for a real nightmare with this storm\nAndrew Freedman science editor for Axios extreme weather expert thank you for joining us they could ...\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOne of the other huge stories of the week was this surreal moment in the Trump Administration when rapper Kanye West went to the oval office he had a meeting with the president\nAnd in true ... fashion he just had this stream of consciousness rent it provided a lot of laughs a lot of question marks nobody knew what he was going for sometimes Miranda you're a big fan of ... yes so what did you think of it\nI have not yet and drop myself to watch the full video right because I still want to continue being a fan of tiny he's made it very challenging because I don't often agree with President Trump\nHe talked about the hat and how was this Superman Cape for him we actually have a little portion of that let's play ... at the oval office\nUh I think it's this regularly that helps you to gay Paul life you know they try to scare me to not where this half my old friends but this has\nIt gives me the power in a way it was something that I put\nOff and they feel like Superman made from that hot and humid for ... for me also got unless you look around to American guy not\nNotable was going to be on it however you want to do if I say this is the goal\nThe president just smiling politely at the end he said hey you know what that was very impressive\nAnd you know ... ... feels like a President Trump is a kindred spirit to him almost he feels like he's the same type of guy who's criticized a lot but\nCapable of doing great things we spoke to Olivia Newt's he sees a Washington correspondent for New York magazine she was in the oval office when Carney was there with the president said we spoke to her about her impressions of that\nAnd then she was also part of a bigger story that happened early in the week she had a private press conference with the president\nMike Pence Mike Pompeo chief of staff John Kelly and that also was another surreal moment it was the closest thing you've ever get to being a fly on the wall so when we come back from the break we'll get into that full interview with Olivia new to this is the daily dive weekend edition [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nWeekend edition let's jump into our interview with Olivia Newt see she's Washington correspondent for New York magazine we're talking about her interview with President Trump but we started off with the whole ... story and asking why he was there in the first place\n[laughter] little\nStunts really humid there to talk about criminal justice reform remember hits life ... current president back in the early ... ... ... for a woman who had been incredible with like ... like effects on a truck charge\nAnd in in speeches and everything I mean at rallies he displays some of those same type of things so how is it sitting in the room trying to ask them questions and him just interrupting jumping all over the place how do you wrap your head around that\nIn real time I didn't find it to a difficult but when I was confronted with how to like ... ...\nI just got a quick amongst the and the ...\nTo try to keep getting any clothes and make them easier to digest you are more focused because that is that how he talked he didn't speak in a clear and concise way and I think ... if he if ever taken out of context and I don't mean that at like an insult your reporter at the way that\nPeople stay in contact with any kind of hits close are chopped up so that they can be clear I think it\nKind of an accurate and you're laying I find it very interesting and it's on that and the ... and a Republican operative on with me on the air she said that she had been at an earlier that night and somebody who was in my piece that she wouldn't say who they float group of people she bumped into him at dinner and he said that the White House\nBut really clean it might be and they really liked it and it kind of a very fair and quote the opposite ... you know I Love to do things because\nIt's not that night it's heat in the world but I think that Trump is probably satisfy\nThe his complications printed in fall I think he did the times that he feels the practice being unfair it's probably a lot of your time like ... ... and ... people try to ... ... what he's saying rather than just putting it out there and so I'm sure people are going to give me some shit about\nPushing a full transcript basically what he said but I think that's\nJust the only way to really understand what he was ...\nI agree with you completely the article is great it's the closest thing to being a fly on the wall in the room thing to to just kind of see what's going on you know and\nAnd as you say it's time to ... might have seen like a production or whatever but\nYou know that's the way it seems like it goes in there and and I I Love the way you wrote it out ... as it happened chronologically as you said the times he interrupted you it was just amazing so I had a great job on that piece and\nYou know it's just great that you were able to be there for these two big moments are just going to last week a Olivia Newt seat Washington correspondent for New York magazine thank you very much for joining us thank you so

back porch creeping then more confident that's wrong nobody was home\nOn the non on the screen door to the kitchen and sounded latched we heard a little sign sounded file began license screen why grandma reached down for something and you're going back to the darkness I managed to notice grandma's rocker was rotten she wasn't in it she was standing over me behind\nI followed her classroom now

library of Congress in the ad council [noise]\n\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar winners and we're running down some of the top stories of the week [noise] don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nOne of the most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian causes but not that had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened one and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soil use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old\nUh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space X and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubled Russian space program\nIt's the only link that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rot pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nThis was a flight as you said a woman astronaut when USS not one cause not go up the space station and they're in the Soyuz spacecraft which also rides up on a rocket I'm the same name that was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the space station to we're going to come back\nNow the space station always has a Soyuz capsule attached up there just in case so that's their get out of jail free card if they need to come home and an emergency but the official seal of approval on that are coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap out the crew or not there's a trend that didn't\nSo apparently what happened is it made it through about two minutes of flight staging per se to second stage or what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally out the drugs they drink but it's been a long time since I've looked at the tells me there might have been something going on with what are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened at staging either an engine\nFailed to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the first stage to drop pre properly so for one reason or another that had to abort\nThe rockets designed to be able to do that\nAnd they all have been since the early space age woke on our side and the ... the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really didn't have it aboard auction until much later than when you were bored your ground control punches a big red button and a capsule let's go from the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule\nWhich are extremely powerful and just burn for a few seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the board but it's like getting slammed with a block of concrete rights but they\nThey said they were forced to do a lipstick reentry what exactly does that mean and because they said that during that something that that have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of what's\nGoing on under it's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot\nAnd even at a normal ... year to look at it maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so ballistic ridge remains ... this is what they did in the very early space age days back and mercury and\nThe boss stock on the Soviet side normally when a space capsule comes back\nIn ... glides a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle in a way the shield loses items such a way and the and they use guidance rockets to ... themselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways met heat shield so it's kind of the shallow gradual reentry that gives you four to five sometimes six cheese\nA ballistic originally just means you've got up over the top of the arc that whatever speed you had goes away and then you come back straight down like a bullet in because you're not scrubbing off any of that energy by moving sideways you're generating a possibly nine jeeze which is a lot\nThe U.S astronaut Nick hey it was his first mission what are riding with a crazy turn of events for him\nA rotten afternoon and they showed some video the fed and at the point that whatever happened happened it started I guess the rock I started to vibrate significantly you can see these two guys in our hands are flapping around like they're trying to learn how to apply of and it's really it's almost comical but realize that it was a tough ride this\nNormally that doesn't happen so they're really they said they were they were weightless at one point even
