suspect are human ashes maybe left on the seat of a ride or something like that you radio over and you say we have a ... a clean up and that means you need to grab the hyper allergenic vacuum because the custodians will then come by and if they do indeed identified the substance of human ashes\nThis they will come up in a vacuum and clean it up while everyone you know leaves the premises and goes on to other rights before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually notice it it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency we were talking about a really quick about how much it makes sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like can we stay here forever so it really means\nSomething to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading these ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks and they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get\nCreative several of them smuggled the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I've talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's or in in the hotel bathroom into a pill bottle that she\nCould then smuggle past park security while others\nWill simply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a ... that that's gotten through security as well and then once they're inside if they want us to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the riots particularly dark so no one sees them other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of the park that doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who in two thousand nine for the ashes of her mother and at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn outside Cinderella\nCastle and ran across the grass flinging them and she ran wild and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have photos of the sit there and I just saw the you\nKnow so so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn flinging ashes doesn't get notice I mean I Can't imagine how many people do this and never get caught but you're right that in talking to custodians the consensus that I arrived at what did it happen about once a month but I've heard stories of it happening more\nFrequently heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I I think the ... says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney so\nProbably it was one of pride that you know at this point\nYeah it's a point of pride it's also I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and something that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved ones final wishes\nSo it was something that they were really touched by an and actually quite eager to share with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the spread these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gates [laughter]\nI Love the quote someone said that the hunted mentioned probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that's one of those places obviously we know the hundred mentioned right is all about spooky and what not and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives the all new meaning you know the next time I'm going to be that I'm going to be like trying to look for human ashes there\nWell I take that as the ultimate compliment I mean I think the thing I heard\nSo many examples that I can say safely say that human ashes have been spread all over these parks the hunted mansion is definitely the most popular destination but it's a small world also had quite a strong showing based mountain pirates of the Caribbean I mean\nReally if you think about it they're probably been human ashes spread there and I don't quite know why the ... the hunted Manchin is so I mean obviously it's on theme right for the practice but in talking to people who work in the hunted mansion they describe just to sort of general obsession among certain fans\nWith the haunted mansion I also think that it's probably strategically a pretty good spot because it's very dark\nAnd there are a lot of places where you can sort of in conspicuously into it\nKnowing this now gives all these rides new meaning when they find ashes and they have to go through the process of locating it cleaning it up\nThey'll close the rides and say they're closer technical difficulties and I've always seen rides closed for technical difficulties before it could be something mechanical but this was also one of those other reason so what's that process when they identify what they think it is and then how do they go through about cleaning\nSo this is a process that will kick start on rights like the hunting mansion so safe or ride comes around people leave and they see some what they think are are human ashes on the seats they will clear out the premises do radio over for a clean up\nThey often do you tell people that there are technical difficulties that they need to attend to and then they will hit out fast passes\nTo people because you know you're standing in line for an hour and then suddenly they say there I'd have to shut down and you have to leave you got to give him something wrong with people are going to get upset so then the the vacuum in come in and they suck it up you know in a manager will often ride the ride by themselves so that they can look and see like are there any\nAshes anywhere in the rye that we need to go in identifying and sweep up and then resume business\nA number of the people I spoke to also dumped ashes in the water of these ride like on pirates and on it's a small world so the water I think it's probably a pretty ... possible place to to discover it you're not going to see that especially in some of those darker rides\nYeah I mean it's a really fun read it's perfect for Halloween ... reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us\nA thank you and if you do see any ashes on the hundred mentioned police comedy so I can do a follow up it definitely was a great thank you\n[noise]

FM Ninety six boys go on a Tuesday\n\nMorning the dead and trying to heal line Jane ... Fox News Pittsburgh or hearts are broken Pittsburgh Mayor Bill de do do on NBC's Meet the press on Saturday mornings in a God massacre\nRight now we're trying to grapple with this horrendous crimes something that is one of the darkest days in our cities history\nSo we now need structural reforms and the only way to get structural reforms is by calling a convention and imposing those structural reforms\nOne great example is terminal and it's simply use to be imposed by people people rotated in office they didn't serve for thirty thirty five years in Congress or in the Senate and so we didn't need term limits now we do need term was when the founders created the Supreme Court for example the Supreme Court\nThe justices average age of appointment was forty seven average life expectancy was fifty four they didn't expect jurors to serve Thirty years on the United States Supreme court so we've broken the system in some pretty fundamental ways that need to be repaired structurally\nThose things aren't going to be repaired by election\nWhat about the process by which we have amended their constitutions numerous times throughout the centuries starting with the bill of rights where you go amendment by women is that just to laborious process to try to get this type of systemic change that you're talking about\nWell I don't think it's that it's so much more laborious the issue is what we're looking at is controlling the federal government if you look at the process\nThe the other process we're proposing amendments amendments after you've proposed by Congress so we're talking about is Congress needs its wings clipped Congress needs balanced budget imposed on in Congress needs term limits imposed on it they will never propose those sorts of amendments that would take two thirds of both houses to propose it\nTry to imagine a time when two thirds of both houses of Congress propose a balanced budget amendment term limits that's just not going to happen\nThey haven't even been able to balance the budget and the length dialing decades let alone propose it so\nWe need this convention of states in order to bring about this type of change that is necessary at this point in our history mark\nOne concern that has raised the as we do have as I mentioned earlier that bill of rights and there is a concern\nThat a convention of states could go rogue and maybe erodes some of the God given rights that are protected by our constitution how you protect against that\nWell first of all the convention is called according to resolutions passed by the states all states have to pass the same resolutions those resolutions preclude any discussion frankly of anything in the bill of rights they literally cannot even be discussed\nWhen you get in convention all the delegations are controlled by the states that sent them the states limit what they can and can't talk about\nToday we need to remember there are thirty three states with both houses controlled by Republicans every delegate that comes is controlled by their legislature so if they even started to try to get out of bounds they could be stopped by their states and ultimately the founders provided the protection which was it takes three quarters of all states are thirty eight states to ratify anything\nYou can do the math I run the math on every single women ever been proposed to me you can't find an amendment that would limit our liberties that could be ratified and even close to thirty eight states\nLet's talk a little bit more about process you touched upon it earlier and the number of states that is needed tell us how many we have you've mentioned how many we need and where do we stand in the process of getting to the critical mass that would allow this convention of states to occur\nSo it takes thirty four states are two thirds of the states to call a convention so far twelve states have done that so we're just over one third of the way there which is extraordinary people said it was impossible to get that far we've gotten that far already and\nSo it takes thirty four to get into convention\nIn convention it takes twenty six states to pass a proposed amendment out of convention important to remember when you're in a convention the only thing I can mention can do is proposed amendment so people get all scared about getting into convention\nIt's merely a place where people alternately make suggestions and then it takes thirty eight states to ratify anything that comes out of convention I think we're well on our way I think the one third mark is a pretty extraordinary landmark\nWe have passed and another Nineteen states in one house or the other you have to get both houses in a concurrent session so I think we're well on her way and I think we should expect to see some pretty extraordinary progress in twenty Nineteen\nMark if you go back in history and I realize and unfortunately it's not being taught at least to the degree of showed in many schools these days but tell us a little bit about the founding of the republic didn't the state's create the federal government and the other way around\nYeah look I think that's the history that's really important and the power pyramid was the\nState's created the federal government the state's essentially were to retain sovereignty they ... they were to have brought on ... powers the federal government was had to have limited any new worried it powers it's now been reverse\nBecause of the rulings of the Supreme Court and really importantly in regard to the commerce clause the federal government can pretty much do anything it wants to do constitutionally and this is a big problem and\nAnd so we need to reverse that power pyramid take the power away from DC make it so DC isn't so important I Would add one more thing there's so much conflict and strife in this country right now politically I don't like it I don't think anybody likes it\nWith the way you reduce that strike is you quit making centralized decisions you take the power away from the federal government give it back to the\nPeople in the states let them make the decisions at home we won't see these huge national fights anymore\nWe have been talking with mark Meckler who is the president and founder of convention of states and convinced the state's action some are just a little bit about convention stage organization where can folks also go on the Web if they want to learn more and get involved in the fight\nSure of the project was founded just about five years ago\nAnd it was founded to take power away from DC give it back to the people people can read about it get involved at convention estates dot com it's supported by literally virtually every major conservative figure in the United states that's commented on Sean Hannity mark Levin Senator Tom Coburn Senator Jim demand\nLots of senators are fast and Rubio they understand that Washington DC isn't working in the way to fix that is take the power away from DC and get it back to the people if\nFolks want to be involved in that they can do that a convention of states dot com\nMark Meckler from convention of states mark thank you for being here good to be with you thanks for having me\nAndy route that the club for growth are keeping an eye on all these congressional races we have going on around the country as well as US Senate races Andy good to have you here I thanks for having me alum Andy as we've talked about many times Republicans currently control both the U.S Senate and the U.S house of representatives\nThe Senate seems to be headed more in the Republican\nDirection but let's talk today about the house right now can you give us an overview as to how many seats Democrats would have to gain and where do they stand in achieving that goal\nThe Republicans are in charge of the house it appears that they are going to lose seats President Trump claims that there'll be a red wave that will counteract that\nAnd to to be honest with you we are kind of seen some something of a red wave but the demo wave was so big\nLeading into the Kavanaugh hearings for the Supreme Court\nThat if a red wave does crop up it'll only reduce the Des Moines have\nJust to confuse the the analogy so right now Republicans are in the majority Democrats have to pick up twenty three seats I think that right now you can count about fourteen seats that will likely go down\nSo that means the Democrats only have to pick up nine more and when you look at the population of seats from which says nine could come from you're looking at about twenty nine or thirty seats\nSo basically nine out of twenty nine nine out of thirty you're looking at about a third so to me it seems likely bar and everything else or all else being equal the Democrats are going to pick up the majority but they will have a very slender\nSlim majority perhaps single digits\nIf we look at that Andy and whether it be Democrats by single digits or Republicans by single digits what does that do for how the house becomes organized and its ability to actually function when you are that closely divided\nTruth is we don't know or at least I haven't experienced this in my working career when this happened when an election that Kurz of the majority in the house is either decisively Democrat or decisively Republican if we got that close to just a single digital majority\nThen we're kind of an uncharted territory at least for the past couple of decades knowing house procedure and and how the rules are structured I suspect what would happen\nAnd this would be fascinating just from a political science perspective\nIs that the majority party presumably the Democrats here would have to make some deal with the Republicans to share some level of power if Democrats get\nControl the house a lot of the Democrats that will be coming in have made several promises to the electorate\nThat they would work across a child that they would be somewhat conservative and that they wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi speaker so I suspect the first thing that would happen after November the Democrats would probably elect somebody uh\nAnd Brian ... is the author of that piece that looks at a not so much\nThe deficit that we're facing today but really the quite scary numbers that we're going to be facing in five or ten years if\nPolicymakers in DC don't get serious about dealing with is Brian tell us a little bit about what that sort of fiscal sue now me that is that is coming for us in the next ten years if we don't sit up and and look at this trillion dollar deficit and and do something about it today\nThe numbers are staggering over the long term to put it into words because it almost sounds like monopoly money when you say the national debt right now with twenty million dollars over the next Thirty years Social Security and Medicare short one hundred trillion dollars\nIncluding over Thirty years numbers or even imagine what it really [laughter] she'll security and Medicare\nWe would have to double\nX rays double your family's tax rate doubled the payroll you wash sure pay for the rest we were not even into account was forty dollars a doubling accent [laughter] I mean\nThere are a lot of details are in the paper here Brian and uh I Would encourage our listeners to check out the longer version of this interview that we have running it reason dot com right now but that you can get all the details there you can read the paper and find it there but in in about the minute or so we have left here Brian what is the basic formula here to avoid\nThis coming debt crisis that America could be facing in the next day and the next decade or so\nWe need to actually come together on the plan mostly been spending but access to be on the table too I Would have the policies factors twenty twenty three\n[laughter] we got to get people to start negotiating this stuff because the reform by trillions\nProblem and then going away to address the program and yes we were actually able to\nIf they really really big problem it could mean a as Brian said it it could mean the doubling of all the taxes that you currently paid of the federal government just to pay the existing debt in the system as a big problem we're not going to solve it unless we start talking about it so at least we've got people like Brian Reed all out there who are talking about it Brian thanks for\nTaking some time to be here on the show thank you\nAnd again that is Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute former Republican policy wonk on the hill as well you can check out his paper on the coming deck Rice's that Manhattan Institute dot org check out our coverage of the budget deficit and of what needs to be done to address and
