said at a sniffing out their own that happened\nTo be sick because you want to quarantine those individuals before they wreak havoc on the rest of the call anyone of that a path to being as a fungus or some other sort of disease but the thing that has evolved over many millions of years in ants which then as you mentioned the fungus hassle\nThan skirt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so that scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around it somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume would smell a little different than a typical and so because they have\nThis really intricate unique system of sniffing out bad actors in the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out\nKilling the ants a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago and this is in fact that they found fossils that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characteristic bite marks of the aunt in them which presume that the fungus has\nBeen doing the wrong time so it probably start out pretty sort kills the ... in the colony but that might get it found out in that would get it dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where you you just stick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article to it has to drive the host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms and the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms and doesn't really show symptoms until it is literally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus ordering it to its doom up you know ten inches up a tree [laughter] so you know this is as I mentioned this is an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem\nPossible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex because the ant colony is it self extremely complex and able to sniff out the sort of manipulation is the end is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball\nTo avoid detection and really pull off this test downing like complex devious manipulate\nAnd that's how we get the zombie I mean he'd so delicate that process in infiltrating the colony and even half the time it right the you know the fungus has a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colony that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight leaf and everything is just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does a originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in a South Carolina I think uh we have a at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nAnd that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ...\nTo bite onto the pain of all if that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above the colony so what has happened here in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is\nThe fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the vein of elite but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a perch\nThat it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the tree the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a perch it's easier to get a purchase on the vein of elite by biting into it so it actually happens here in the United states as as the\nFungus there's ordering the ... to bite onto the ... it's not such a good purchase but\nThen orders the answer rap its legs around the twigs and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attaches them to that stem and that's just all the more power to to purchase there and you know get a good grasp because in the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly\nAs it does in the rain forest where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and it will over winter just sitting there on the stem biting its time and then once the spring comes around at work then finally are up out of the back of the head\nOf the ... as it does in the rain or anywhere you know in the rain forest a dozen and\nA number of days as opposed to month upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely adapted to really ruin the day the ants in a in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead tell us about the book\nYeah though that turns out that the fungus is just one of the\nMany many manipulators among parasites and the animal kingdom so it turns out that this is across different species do worms do it to crickets their war or to the cricket foot jump into water which is not of course ... the credit which can drown or you can buy fish and it's at that point the worms are up and then ...\nThat's a particular kind of manipulation rabies actually is a a very well known\nParasitic manipulated that does it usually to raccoons and ... and things like that but can also get into the human brain so\nThe book is about the wide range of parasites the really incredible range of parasites more than you'd ever imagine that can take over the minds of their hosts and really the way that by releasing chemicals or physically altering\nStructures in the brain so called by living dead and yes it's it's a what I Hope they're fascinating exploration hope is very strange kingdom a species that are really ruining the

Eighteen people in the limo and to pedestrians were killed\nBut if that one time it is something someone has to have recorded\nYeah yeah very good advice looks like a little deeper into suspicious activity what are what are some examples I mean we mentioned the bag but what are some other examples of what you would call suspicious activity\nYeah I mean first of all it's just it's something that everyone just you get that got feeling right you might know when something is off or it's not normal um\nAnd and that's what you should really trust you should always trust you got\nA but in terms of some specific examples of that we generally talk about\nObviously the bags situation a maybe a suspicious vehicle or that you see 'em\nYou know moving around in in an area that's not normally there or someone that appears to be conducting surveillance um you know eliciting curiosity beyond just kind of what standard or maybe ... questions about security protocols procedures\nI'm asking about\nYou know just overall personnel or how operations work at a certain secure facility\nUm someone on a ... a photographing us security cameras were protocol\nSomeone who is acquiring an unusual amount of\nUh materials um you know that could be used to do harm whether that's chemicals um were weapons um\nThese are things that should trigger a someone's curiosity why does that person need that much of that why is that person talking about doing this I'm\nOne of highlight this is not about suspicious keep All right okay this is about suspicious behaviors\nUm and that's really important and this is not about someone's gender race and ethnicity ... it's really about behaviors um ... and the activities that someone's participating in a that could be indicative of future crime\nRight and and we've seen with the various incidents that all of these potential stereotypes really it it runs the whole gamut and like you said it's more about the behavior than the person\n... percent I mean there are a lot of incidents unfortunately a lot of incidents that have happened over the last few years that you know people can look back and say oh well\nYou know did someone see that should have reported that um but you know there are also number incidents where people did see something and they did report it a\nLot of incidents that probably get stopped everyday that don't get reported about I'm\n... and that I think we we should do have a a trust that goes into ... incidents were stopped because someone saw something it said something and we don't necessarily have to know the details other than to know that it was a\nDefinitely I mean even though I just said there are a number of incidents that have happened which has stopped there are a number of incidents which we do know about that have been stopped and and it's it's an innocent bystander or it's the um you know the hot dog stand guy you know who's at the same quarter everyday\nUh and all of a sudden noticed is something different right I mean\nAgain it's on every person\nTo what we like to say is quote unquote protect your everyday meaning you know what's in your community what do you do you know whether it's your school it's your neighborhood it's\nYou know every day at eight o'clock you walk your dog\nUm you know a few blocks away to go get a cup of coffee well if that's your route every day you're going to know if something is not right there you're going to know if there's a truck that's not normally park there you're going to know if there is a a bunch of unattended bags on that route\nThat's what you need to trust right that that's what everyone needs to do you need to look at their own routine their own community or what we call your everyday and that's what you really need to to be aware of and conscious of and and that's where you can really make the most difference [noise]\nFor talking with Jill Price campaign manager for the if you see something say something campaign of us apartment of homeland security\nSo if we do see some activities like this\nFood we say something to who do we report it to\nA Bernie great great question um when you if you see something that you need to report a\nDon't try to intervene yourself don't try to solve the problem yourself don't try to diffuse a situation contact local law enforcement right away or if it's an emergency you can always call nine one one I'm\nAnd then be very specific ah when when you make that call 'em talk about a\nBut she's what you have observed I'm you know who you've seen 'em or where it occurred uh and overall just generally why you think it's suspicious right this is information that local law enforcement will use a\nTwo to investigate and ultimately make a determination if further actions needed\nAnd it and it's really good if a couple of people see the same thing that reinforces that for them\nOf course I mean just to to reiterate what we talked about before I think local law enforcement would rather have five calls on something that they deem suspicious than no calls and then ultimately have something you know bad happened\nSo the national if you see something say something day is coming up give some details about that the the who what when\nWell we are really excited about this this is the first year that we are going to be hosting\nThe national if you see something say something awareness day ah we just think this is an opportunity to further highlight the work that we've been doing a but more importantly to\nDesignate one day where we can further highlight\nUm the message that hopefully people are remembering three hundred sixty five days a year but we are taking this one opportunity to ah\nYou know further emphasize this and we think it has the ability to be a really special uh a vent for us on meaningful 'em and very impactful\nYeah and that day is sorry that day so you were twenty five and we just\nThink it's a perfect opportunity to really highlight this message and are not only do we want citizens to feel empowered on that day but we're working with some of the campaigns biggest partners I'm both a\nA private sector companies a state and local government entities I academic institutions are and then of course we're working with our great partners here I heard media or who are really helping spread this message um on leading up to this day I'm On this day uh\nAnd just generally a throughout the year and so we really appreciate that\nOh we're we're proud to be part of that certainly a valuable thing for everybody across the whole country what can we as individuals citizens do in advance of the day or on that day\nWell you know we we are interested to see how this rolls out right again this is our first time doing this\nUm but in advance or the first thing I Would encourage everyone to do is visit the website that we've set up\nFor this day uh that's W. W. W. dot D. H. S. dot Gov slash see said day which is S. E. S. A. Y. da ... all one word\nAnd we think that uh you know entities and individuals can learn about that day ah there are materials that they can download a one thing that we're really encouraging people to do is uh at all on that page there is a\nUh the opportunity to download all we're calling a bubble sign and uh you can write on their\nUm you know it says why I see say\nAnd you can write on there you know the answer to that question you know how you personally answer it whether you want to write you know your friends your family or community\nBecause it's the right thing to do in you know infinite answers are but we would encourage people to fill that out take pictures of himself put it on social media\nAre and all that direction and and the advice that we're giving people is a is included on the Web site\nThat's a very interesting website I went to it and there's something on there called take the challenge and it's a series of um of short videos displaying some scenarios and asking you what what are you describe describing and I'll take my experience\nFor sure yeah I mean so the campaign at large um has an a wide variety of materials that we that we use to publicize a an emphasize this message um so we have posters 'em and\nYou know what you're referring to is one of our public service announcements we have a series a number of different series or whether it's a video called officials that kind of highlight some sports\nYou know entities or we have one that's called protect your everyday kind of ... you know eliciting the message that we're talking about earlier we actually have one that's coming out um called why I see say\nUm you know we talked about some specific examples before but let's kind of re cabinet and reiterate so we know that the easiest example that people always know is that right to left over you know the left on his headed back yeah but we're moving right we just can't focus on that\nWe have to focus on other indicators of your other behavioral science um and so you know a couple of examples of that we can talk about uh things like\nA surveillance so people are\nBeyond your curiosity normal um\nWatching of people watching of a security protocols watching uh the outside of buildings or or traffic patterns things like that or we can talk about people who are uh you know a\nEliciting information beyond mere curiosity again same thing about security protocols or what people are doing at work um but we can a suspicious people might be or activity might also be a\nYou know express you know a threat making a real threat I'm a implied or real explicit or we can be looking at\nA ... acquisition of materials or the storage materials or maybe it's an unusual amount of fertilizer chemicals I'm also weapons people who are obtaining weapons or\nA guns knives or other things that might be able to utilize to cause harm or\n... again ... ... people have the right to have these things and it might be you know completely normal um but if it's unusual a large amount that should raise red flags yeah yeah\nAnd then you also mentioned to specifically it's we're looking at the behaviors and not\nPeople yeah I mean I cannot emphasize that enough it's not suspicious people okay it's not what someone looks like it's not who they are ... it's about the activity and the behavior or that they're involved in 'em and\nAnd that's what's really important to remember yeah\nVery good we have a couple of minutes to go anything else that you'd like to to add a repeat or emphasize\nYeah I mean I first of all just you know thanks thank you you know for for doing this interview uh this is a really important message um everyone should feel empowered\n'em to report they should be proud to report um they should feel secure in reporting a\nAnd when you are a when you're wondering whether or not you should report I think about oh why you would do this right it's for your friends it's for your family it's for your community it's because it's the right thing to do\nUm and and never think of the bystander effect yeah I'd never assume that your neighbor never assume the person next to you on the sidewalk is going to report it again was tossed out a couple of times I Believe law enforcement rather have five calls on something that's potentially a you know\nUh you know terrorist related or they're not had any um\nYou know it's really\nOne thing we like to say is a homeland security begins with hometown security mhm um and and so it's all important we know our local community as best\nWe should feel proud to protect that and keep those secure and uh you know we really believe that um alert communities a informs communities a Jew player that role and keep your nation safe\nUm and and everyone can play their own role\nUm as we've talked about uh we like to say protect your every day yeah and again that's your normal routine or that is a\nYou know your your everyday local community that was great slogan yeah ... and the last thing I'll just say is you know\nWe have rape partners across the country\nUm that we work with and we couldn't spread this message or affective Lee without them so or whether it is a fortune five hundred companies whether it is national sports leagues whether it is a institutions of higher education\nOr whether it is many companies like I heard media or we rely on people and entities across this country a big and small or to spread the message um state and local governments\nAnd uh we are so appreciative of everyone's efforts and then just remember that this year September twenty five is our first or\nA ... a national if you see something say something awareness day and I'm really excited about that in hopes that further emphasizes the important message that that we try to spread throughout the rest of the year\nYeah very good and also encourage people to take the challenge of\nYeah ... like that I think you have to go back in may have to redo it\nBernie I'm going to definitely go back and redo it\nDealer price campaign manager for the if you see something say something campaign of the U.S department of homeland security\nAnd to see something say something day on September ... a great to meet you in a ... enjoyed getting all the information will have to or what to do this again that'd be great and best wishes on on the day I'm
