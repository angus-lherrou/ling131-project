bought my small apartment complexes uh and started learning more and more money that I bought medium size apartment the larger apartment support at every level that I pass through I Want you to understand\nThat every level was an additional learning curve every level created fear\nYou know I I was just scared to buy a single family house was when I started with them\nBut I was just excited at the returns that I was getting from the single family houses if you're out there and you're ... you're listening to this big numbers I'd throw around us you know get a religious Thirty years of doing this so it's really not I'm not even proud to throw that out I probably should have ten times more money than what I have I just wasn't that aggressive\nUm but if you're back they're starting where I started out where most people start at is that you and you got to get out there and you've got to just change your mind you need to self educate yourself that's the most important thing\nAnd then you need to start thinking about your family's wealth as a business and not think about your family's money as little bill is college fund for get little Billy if you're a millionaire by the time Billy goes to college don't you think you can afford to send Billy to college\nDon't save for college by in a bar but complex and make enough money in that apartment complex can not only make you rich for pay his way through college\nWhen he's done with college you'll still have the apartment complex you still have the income and it'd be worth even more so get rid of the little Billy college fund\nGet rid of the um ... retirement fund you don't need a retirement fund you don't need a pile of money sitting there doing nothing for you to die with\nOr to rather live off of before you die you

have financial statements do you have a balance sheet do you ever resume do you have a list of all of your investments you look at I look at them three or four times a month\nAs different payments come in each time a payment company that go back to my calculation I keep track of how much I'm earning on all my passive income investments to the to the penny each month I compare them I compete them I tried to make them better every month\nI keep track of all of my earned income that are I tried to make that better\nAll of my business income I tried to track all but I Do track all my

professional that specializes in income planting the problem is that most of us have been meeting with financial professionals that specialize in if come planning I Know that's a little corny but I'm Talking about the difference between income planning and if complaining\nMy financial advisors called income planning because you can count on it coming in to save money accounts or that I deal with are based on contractual guarantees backed up by the assets a very large top rated companies\nTherefore you can count on the money coming into your retirement\nA lot of financial professionals specialize in if complaining I call it the F complaining because you don't know if it's going to be there when you need it\nIf comes retirement money that's invested in stocks bonds mutual funds and other variable accounts\nIf come as the type of money that can be gone overnight because of a a war or planes crashing into buildings or economic downturn or a or a cricket CEO just cause your retirement to collapse those things happen\nSo let me ask you do you want income planning that you can count on do you want a lifetime income account with guaranteed growth of up to six and a half percent compounding interest up to seven percent bonuses on your deposit and a lifetime of income that you can never outlive or do you uh\nIf come planting the type of planning that can cause fifty percent or more of your retirement money to disappear without notice for reasons that you and I have no control over\nThe type of planning that has high fees on some financial advisor town you don't worry it's only a paper last by the way do you ever hear those advisors down you don't worry it's only a paper again now are typically not and keep in mind\nThese accounts that I'm Talking about these

you know a variable accounts make their money even when you're elevator car\nIs in freefall uh the the fees they charge reduce your account whether it's going up or down the money is made every single year on your out no matter what\nNow don't get me wrong there's a place for those accounts and some have you done very well I just don't happen to believe that that's a good place for your money when

fmri Ninety six point one agency to\nHeartbreak in Pittsburgh I'm Joe ... in the morning has began to Pittsburgh after eleven people lost their lives when a man's spewing anti Semitic comments open fire to synagogue six other people were injured including for police officers the suspect other us\nI think the investigation now has centered in on Florida they think that a lot of the packages might have originated out of their\nAll do investigators and actually believe that some of the package math and delivered by hand by Cory are they now concluded that all had more likely than through the mail and a similarity across all of these packages is that the return address was the office\nOf Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz the court thing also misspelled\nBut there are a lot of similarities that we're seeing with all of these packages they each had about that first class\nStance on that and they were very heavily tape in manila envelopes lined with bubble wrap all the mailing labels were printed on a computer so the bottom line here at that fortunately no one was hurt that authorities are still\nUnsure of why these bombs seemingly to be structured similarly to python didn't go off and now the question is whether that was because of their intention to simply incite fear and not harm or if there was a technical fly that prevented it from going up\nAnd because of the similarities all the with the packaging and the actual devices themselves they do believe they're all connected\nOr we don't know if it's a single person or group of people but they're all connected that way I Know experts have said that because the devices did not go off there is a treasure trove of forensic clues that they can look at anything from DNA fingerprints\nAnd that's obviously where the investigation is starting I mean they're even looking at video when the packages first made it into the postal system as a you know everything is tracked by video when it starts in the postal system so they're trying to like retroactively go back to see where it started and if there's any video of the person may be dropping off or something\nIt's almost like they're trying to start from the end of the construction of the device then work their way back\nSo for now the packages have either a rise are still things than to Quantico the lab and Virginia and what they're going to try to do is traced this as it as that could include DNA or fibers found on the package as friends on the back of the stance\nOr on the pay they'll be getting this assembling\nThese packages and attempt to trace them back to their vendor and so now they're going to try and see whether the constructor of these seemingly pipe bombs whether they left them sort of stagnant\nOr whether they left on sort of air enemy wiring and maybe that was sort of their trade so there are a lot of quit that investigators now have to put together they just have a big puzzle at it then\nAnd we learned a little bit more about the devices themselves they said they were made out of PVC pipe covered with black tape beach I like a small battery some wires maybe some broken glass for maximum damage but is there anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very new details about that that that ... the the fight that they were saying that these are capable of being lied explosive\nWhether or not they are it's still unclear we know that they have taken X rays at the explicit than are examining those and are going through the wiring than the battery aunts and the overall material that age are constructed from\nIt's hard to ignore who the targets are George Soros the Clintons the Obamas CNN and John Brennan Eric Holder Debbie Wasserman Schultz as you've said is the return address for all of the ten devices\nRepresentative Maxine Waters Joe Biden Robert Deniro these are all high profile Democrats and critics of the president the administration how was the president been responding\nThat President has largely been hunting blame off of himself and his rhetoric and back onto the media so that we thought different Trump rally from his normal show on Wednesday night it was absent from the lock her up chants while he was speaking are fake news references to the point\nBack at the end of the ... men criticizes the media and the crowd goes wild he did however at that rally\nCalls for the media to unite the country he also tweeted on Thursday again blaming the media for that these that that have very big part of the anger that we've seen in our society is caused by basically fake\nNews and that it's gotten so bad that it's beyond description so what we see here is something very standard of the president uh these days says that he is not wanting to take the blame for himself I Would imagine that would be\nPretty careful that played impact and in the mid term that works you will embrace that the blame for that and putting it back to one of his easiest targets which is the media\nYeah it's going to be interesting to see how it all shakes out the investigation is ongoing no details are going to be coming in and changing every day and the man hunt is on to see who or what group might have Sundays out thank you very much Lauren Meyer reporter fractious thanks for joining us\nThank you so much [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nElection season and you know you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this year for political campaigns to reach voters is not through these ads on social media it's not TV it's not these robo calls\nIt's flooding cell phones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate these rules on automated both texting it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McCabe he's a tech reporter at ... for more on this\nThese are what are called peer to peer messages so use these robo calls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial media can dial more people because it's a machine during that island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls robots hex\nActually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line and look how many more popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use where it'll auto film whatever message it is the key as you were saying the peer to peer these campaigns need somebody to literally hit send for every single one and they say that these people can ... thousands of them and our\nRight I mean they use these platforms on both the left in the riot problems like open sesame or hustle you know but that's not the right hospital or to on the on the left to fend these tax than it is actually building a a platform to do that\nAt scale and of course it's not entirely unlike phone banking we all know that people can go and they will call and they have political candidates often at all uncommon space with other people are supporters so it's not entirely on like that in terms of\nIt being another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rate of about Ninety percent basically if they send it to you you're more than ... Ninety percent likely to actually open it and read some of it at least so the the engagement is there\nAnd open to me which is one of these providers to Ninety percent of tech method is a red within five minutes and I mean I think that is in ... we know how impactful that could be given that we get\nOh my gosh you're right the as things gaining traction in advance so quickly there probably could be a phone that does that and and you know then it's making appointments for you at all this stuff and then do you\nThink Jeff stinky like hey do you want to reply or hey\nDo you want to have an appointment it's actually empowered with the agency to make\nThe decision for you so you get a text message it's like hey you want to meet for dinner and hypothetical your phone could say yeah I Do and my concern is that changes fundamentally so many aspects of social interaction if we are letting our computers make those decisions for us\nBut I also have just a logistical intractable a question about how something like that would work I mean if my phone agrees to a dinner date for me\nHow do I make sure I Know that I has agreed to that and what if my friend dinner and I'm not there and they're pissed off at me right and I the one to blame or is my phone to blame it ... it sounds like a nightmare\nYeah or you're just talking to a friend in person and then you double book herself because your phone did it for you\nI mean you know this is like you say we were talking about black mirror and stuff but this leads us further beyond that into\nThe movie with Joaquin Phoenix and her and then all these am I going to be talking to each other and then leave everybody at the end of it you know I mean I just love all of this future talk but it's not so far off anymore these things are advancing so fast you mentioned the law passed in California that they have to disclose their ...\nBecause things are moving so fast and all that regulatory stuff is always so far behind\nSome people are very against this chat bought disclosure law\nBecause they think that it might quiet or tiny innovation in\nThe ... market which actually you know these kind of automated ... services have a really utility and so there's a lack of regulation and then there may also be a knee jerk need to regulate out of fear is a very uncharted territory I Would say um but we are all ready\nYou know it's serious it's also you know we've been talking about the funny or unexpected are weird ways in which these\nBox will affect society but also bad actors can take advantage of these thoughts and turn them into spam machines or other and the various uses and at the moment we are at the mercy\nOf the tech companies to try to design these product in such a way as to minimize their potential for abuse but we just basically crossing our fingers and already tried that\nAnd the trust is not always there so in the meantime the where the robots Emily ... senior writer for wired thank you very much for joining us and care\n[noise]\nDon't forget to join us on social media really dive pod on Twitter and daily podcast unpaid leave us a comment give us a rating and tell us a story that you're interested in\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts\nMosque rumors and this is the daily dive weaken the [noise]\n[noise] you can hear\nLater much later we heard something\nThan footsteps on the back porch creeping then more confident after all nobody\nWas home on a on a screen door kitchen and founded latched we heard a little sign sounded filed began slice of the screen why grandma reached down for something in her sewing bashed the darkness I managed to notice grandma's rocker was wrong she wasn't in it she was standing over me behind\nI followed her classroom because now we were by the door this couple of heavy feet in there on the Korean Quinones\nUndermine do she wouldn't that there are some she touched the matched something or other hand\nMention me down and wrote this book it's\nMorning world find out what happens next by reading the book a long way from Chicago by Richard peck\nBrother read book ideas visit literacy dot Gov message from the library of Congress in the ad council [noise]\n\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week I don't have to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nFor the ongoing stories that has been happening for a few weeks now is that of the Central American migrants caravan that it's making his way from Honduras there's members from Guatemala and El Salvador as well the Trump Administration is planning to dispatch about eight hundred or more active duty troops to the southern border\nTo help stop the flow of migrants into the country defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops of the border bolstering the national guard forces that are already there\nThe additional troops would provide logistical support to the border patrol the plan is not yet been finalized or formerly announced but it is expected to happen for more on the migrant carbon we spoke to Ted has and he's an immigration reporter for Politico and we started off by talking about the president's reaction to the Caribbean and the implications for the midterm elections\nWe've seen the president talked tough on this issue and this is nothing new I mean this goes back to the last time there was a caravan back in April I mean I think\nThe one difference we have here is we're now at the doorstep of November's midterm elections and this was a political issue for him obviously he really wants to make it about his policies and the need for a border wall versus what the Democrats stand for what he characterizes as open borders\nHe's saying that these countries you know under a self Salvador Guatemala they're not doing enough to keep these people there I Know Mexico's National Guard there so you know some military guys they put up a road blockade at one point but then they tore down right away\nI guess maybe there was too many people are they knew they were going to be able to handle it the countries are doing something maybe just not enough and like I said now he wants to start cutting aid I think last year these three countries had more than a combined five hundred million dollars in funding from the U.S I think so far this year it's been about two hundred million dollars\nIn aid has been shrinking in recent years to begin with back in twenty Seventeen it was\nSomewhere around seven hundred million to mostly to these three Central American countries Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and then in twenty Eighteen down to six hundred and Fifteen million and now it's been proposed by both the house and the Senate to bring it down somewhere in the five hundred million dollar range and and and the Trump Administration was actually asking for even lower\nSomewhere and four hundred million so even before all this happened President Trump was already proposing to cut aid to the Central American countries so that in itself is nothing new I mean what is interesting though is that he doesn't want to do that on his own and these are bills passed by Congress and Congress will consider what amounts to give in Central American aid when the time comes\nAnd the president being very forceful on this stuff does give some political cover to Republicans who have to push this through because the Democrats are going to be on the opposite side of it with regards to the mid term do you know he's saying\nWhenever you see these people come across in these criminals and unknown middle Easterners and everything she the Democrats in mind we have to change our crappy immigration laws so he makes it about the midterms everything any provides a little covered by being forceful but\nIs there not much political will on the part of Congress to do something I I'm there was some immigration bills that tried to pass this past year and none of them went through even some of the ones that the White House was backing\nI mean I think you really need to consider his words in the context of where we are right now only being two weeks away from the mid term and I think it is the issue that is really important to Republican voters and it\nSeems like it's going up an interest in recent weeks and so for Democrats essentially as a way for them to mobilize their base to get them out to the polls now whether\nAny of these proposals you know border wall flashing funding to Central America rewriting asylum laws I mean these are all really big projects and even maybe a year ago a little less than a year ago when Congress was working in a bipartisan fashion to address them\nThey really struggled to do so and they weren't able to advance any legislation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jason Doyle", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "27"}
