information surrounding the payment processing and the treatment that these patients are getting\nRiley Griffin reporter for Bloomberg News thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having me [noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll right I'm Glad we're finally here this is my favorite story of the week we've all heard stories about passengers flying with ah their cats and their dogs in some cases I don't know why this is so popular but they're miniature horses if people flying with their emotional support animals\nAnd you know the list is longer than that to peacocks hamsters a decoy wearing a diaper I Wish I could have seen the deprecating pigs unfortunately the latest one in this line of emotional support animals as lady flying with her pet squirrels or I'm Sorry her emotional support squirrel\nI'm I brought in my producer Miranda for more details on this just to find out how crazy the stories and we also talk about what steps you need to take to actually get cleared to have an emotional support animal\nThis woman was removed from a frontier airlines flight late Tuesday night when she tried to fly with her emotional support squirrels and then she refused to get off the plane after being told no according to the airline so frontier spokesperson made a statement and said that\nYes the passenger did follow protocol by calling them in advance and saying that she would be flying with an emotional support animal but she never specified that it would be anything other than the typical dog or cat right they had no idea that they were going to have a rodent on board\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flights\nSo if it seems to be some type of policy\nOkay that could have been figured out she called in advance so he said the flight was traveling from Orlando to Cleveland\nThey told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take other passengers off the plane everybody how to get off so that they can be plain hurt they had to call the police forcibly remove her from the flight right and that in and of itself is a huge pain there is a fun facts I think you can sure there's ... a frontier airlines features a variety of animals on the tails of its plant\nYeah so they're saying that they have animals on the tails of there\nPlanes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar\nSame made a score of course they did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering them because we have a little bit of audio [noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses there it is again miniature horses seem to be white ... auto wanting the question then becomes how do people get emotional support\nAnimals I feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better there's actually a political that you need to go through to have an emotional support and\nWell there's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses are not required to accommodate them\nSo things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the our service dog because you're blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain an emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed you have to actually go to a mental health professional right and they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental\nIllness or ... disability you may have and from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they be well behaved and not jerks in public right don't have to have any kind of special training\nAll domesticated animals may qualify as an emotional support em cats dogs mice rabbits birds hedgehogs rats mini pigs ferrets the list goes on and on so\nThey can be any age can be happy it can be a kitten it doesn't have to be a full grown\n... so this world could very well have qualified to be an emotional support animal I think she had it in some type of carrier and like it wasn't going to run around and cause a bunch of trouble\nBut less than adults that spokesperson said that they've had issues with these emotional support animals on fights including dog's having panic attacks needing to get oxygen administer to them the flight attendants being bitten by other support animals ducks just wandering the aisles blocking the beverage cards\nI Wonder if she did have a letter saying that it was an emotional support animal I Know a lot of people forge those things because they're pretty easy it's yes basically a doctor is now is what I\nMean there's even Web sites where you can go on line fill out a yes or no questionnaire and print out your certificate sort of like becoming ordained to do your friend's wedding\nThat's just a ... it's a tough thing because riding in a plane is a common space you're in tight quarters you got to share that space and be respectful of other people\nAnd you never know what's going to happen with an animal poop and pee all over the place I'm like I said I think the squirrel was probably not going to be that big of a problem but you know once the flight attendants are asking you to get off the plane it's already going to be a problem\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOh man I just love that you know I'm not typically a nervous flier at all I Do get a little wary when you know the turbulence starts hitting but other than that I'm pretty solid when it comes to fly how 'bout you Miranda\nDepends on the people that I see at the gate if they're all just kind of chilling and looking at their phones I'll be good yeah but if there are a bunch of rowdy people or they're drunk already opposite\nAnd it'll cause that anxiety or you depending on how everybody else's so here's the important question Randy if you did get anxious what would your emotional support animal be and it can be a cat or dog has got to be a little something something a little more exotic\nOkay cause might go to is I'm going to bring my dog I\nThere are ten years less I Would have brought my own dog as well but you can't do that this is something\nIn the line of a peacock some hamsters can I have an emotional support turtle there you go that's a that's a good one they're quiet kind of cute in com that is true that my animal turtle\nI think my emotional support animal would be a flop [laughter] because they moved again they're quiet they don't get into too much action but I don't think that's why I think that'd be cute and something fun to a good conversation started Oh thank you Miranda thanks [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAll right that's it for us this weekend he sure to check out the

box here and do this take me to good well I can really make a difference\nYour donations to good will create new jobs training programs and education assistance for people in your community defined

agenda and arguing that vote for any Democrat is a vote against the things the president wants to get done in\nDefinitely I mean you know the the example of a bag unattended bag is probably the easiest when am I right um and you know whether you pass on the street or in the airport as you said it's very easy to just walk by it and say someone else will say something\nTo me that's the worst thing you can do um I think uh my personal opinion and I think a ... a law enforcement would rather have five people tell them about the bag that no one tell them about the bag and you know what the best thing that can happen is someone reports about that bag and it's absolutely nothing\nBut if that one time it is something someone has to have reported\nYeah yeah very good advice looks like a little deeper into suspicious activity what are what are some examples I mean we mentioned the bag but what are some other examples of what you would call suspicious activity\nYeah I mean first of all it's just it's something that everyone just you get that got feeling right you might know when something is off or it's not normal um\nAnd and that's what you should really trust you should always trust you got\nA but in terms of some specific examples of that we generally talk about\nObviously the bags situation a maybe a suspicious vehicle or that you see 'em\nYou know moving around in in an area that's not normally there or someone that appears to be conducting surveillance um you know eliciting curiosity beyond just kind of what standard or maybe ... questions about security protocols procedures\nI'm asking about\nYou know just overall personnel ah how operations work at a certain secure facility\nUm someone on a ... a photographing us security cameras or protocol\nSomeone who is acquiring an unusual amount of\nUh materials um you know that could be used to do harm whether that's chemicals um were weapons um those these are things that should trigger\nA someone's curiosity why does that person need that much of that why is that person talking about doing this I'm\nOne of highlight this is not about suspicious keep All right okay this is about ... years\nUm and that's really important I this is not about someone's gender race and ethnicity ... it's really about behaviors um ... ... and the activities that someone's participating in a that could be indicative of future crime\nRight and and we've seen with the various incidents that that all of these potential stereotypes really it it runs the whole gamut and like you said it's more about the behavior than the person\nHundred percent I mean there are a lot of incidents unfortunately a lot of ...\nIncidents that have happened or over the last few years that you know people can look back and say oh well you know\nIt's someone see that should have reported that um but you know there are also number incidents where people did see something and they did report it a lot of incidents that probably get stopped everyday that don't get reported about I'm\n... and ... and I think we we should and do have a a trust that goes into incidents were stopped because someone saw something and said something and we don't necessarily have to know the details other than to know that it was a\nDefinitely I mean even though I just said there are a number of incidents that have happened which has stopped there are a number of incidents which we do know about that have been stopped and and it's it's an innocent bystander to or it's a\nUm you know the hot dog stand guy you know who's at the same quarter every day uh and all of a sudden noticed is something different right I mean\nAgain it's on every person\nTo what we like to say is quote unquote protect your everyday meaning you know what's in your community what do you do you know whether it's your school it's your neighborhood it's\nYou know every day at eight o'clock you walk your dog um you know a few blocks away to go get a cup of coffee well if that's your route every day\nYou're going to know if something is not right there you're going to know if there's a truck that's not normally park there you're going to know if there is a a bunch of unattended bags on that route\nThat's what you need to trust right that that's what everyone needs to do they need to look at their own routine their own community or what we call your everyday and that's what you really need to to be aware of and conscious of and and that's where you can really make the most difference [noise]\nWe're talking with Taylor Price campaign manager for the if you see something say something campaign of U.S Department of homeland security\nSo if we do see some activities like this\nWho do we say something to who to report it to a\nBernie great great question um when you if you see something that you need to report a\nDon't try to intervene yourself don't try to solve the problem yourself\nDon't try to diffuse a situation contact local law enforcement right away or if it's an emergency you can always call nine one one\nI'm ... and then be very specific ah when when you make that call\n'em talk about uh what you what you have observed I'm you know who you've seen 'em or where it occurred uh and overall just generally why you think it's suspicious right this is information that local law enforcement will use\nA two to investigate\nAnd ultimately make a determination if further actions needed\nAnd it and it's really good if a couple of people see the same thing that reinforces that for them\nOf course I mean just to to reiterate what we talked about before I think local law enforcement would rather have five calls on something that they deem suspicious then no calls and then ultimately have something you know bad happened\nSo the national if you see something say something day is coming up give some details about that the the who what when\nWell we are really excited about this this is the first year that we are going to be hosting the national if you see something say something awareness day ah we just think uh this is an opportunity to further highlight the work\nThat we've been doing a but more importantly to\nDesignate one day where we can further highlight um the message that hopefully people are remembering three hundred six five days a year but we are taking this one opportunity to uh\nYou know further emphasize this and we think it has the ability to be a really special uh a vent for us um meaningful 'em and very impactful\nYeah and that day is sorry\nThat day so you have or twenty five ... we just think it's a perfect opportunity to really highlight this message and not only do we want citizens to feel empowered on that say but we're working with some of the campaigns biggest partners um both I'm\nA private sector companies a state and local government entities I academic institutions are and then of course we're working with our great partners here I heard media or who are really helping spread this message um on leading up to this day I'm On this day uh\nAnd just generally I throughout the year and so we really appreciate that\nOh we're we're proud to be part of that certainly a valuable thing for everybody across the whole country what can we as individuals citizens do in advance of the day or on that day\nWell you know\nWe we are interested to see how this rolls out right again this is our first time doing this um blood in advance or the first thing I Would encourage everyone to do is visit the website that we've set up\nFor this day uh that's W. W. W. dot D. H. S. dot Gov slash see said day which is S. E. S. A. Y. D a why all one word\nAnd we think that uh you know entities and individuals can learn about that day uh there are materials that they can download a one thing that we're really encouraging people to do is uh at all on that page there is a\nUh the opportunity to download all we're calling a bubble sign and uh you can write on their\nUm you know it says why I see say\nAnd you can write on there you know the answer to that question you know how you personally answer it whether you want to write you know your friends your family or community\nBecause it's the right thing to do and you know infinite answers a vote we would encourage people to fill that out take pictures of himself put it on social media\nAre and all that direction and and the advice that we're giving people is a is included on the Web site\nThat's a very interesting website I went to it and there's something on there called take the challenge and it's a series of um of short videos displaying some scenarios and asking you what what are you describe describing and I'll take my experience\nAuthoritative I'm a physician up but most importantly you should notify you know law enforcement\nAnd uh again if it's an emergency thinking each immediate attention or you can always call nine one one\nUm you should call them are now there it's also important to know that there are some things that seem suspicious\nOr that don't require me to attach it just requires further investigation up by law enforcement and so\nUm you know we talked about some specific examples before but let's kind of recap Mitt and reiterate so we know that the easiest example that people always know is that right the left over you know the left on his headed back yeah but we're moving right we just can't focus on that\nWe have to focus on other indicators of your other behavioral science um and so you know a couple of examples of that we can talk about uh things like\nA surveillance so people I'm\nBeyond and your curiosity normal um\nWatching of people watching of a security protocols watching uh the outside of buildings or or traffic patterns things like that or we can talk about people who are uh you know a\nEliciting information beyond mere curiosity again same thing about security protocols or what people are doing at work um but we can a suspicious people might be or activity might also be a\nYou know express you know a threat making a real threat I'm an implied or real explicit or we can be looking at\nUh the acquisition of materials or the storage materials or maybe it's an unusual amount of fertilizer chemicals I'm also weapons people who are obtaining weapons or\nGuns or knives or other things that might be able to utilize the cause harm or\n... again ... people have the right to have these things and it might be you know completely normal or what if it's unusual a large amount that should raise red flags yeah yeah\nAnd then you also mentioned the specifically it's we're looking at the behaviors and not\nPeople yeah I mean I cannot emphasize that enough it's not suspicious people okay it's not what someone looks like it's not who they are I it's about the activity and the behavior or that they're involved in 'em and and that's what's really important to remember yeah\nVery good we have a couple of minutes to go anything else that you'd like to to add a repeat or emphasize\nYeah I mean I first of all just you know thanks thank you you know for for doing this interview uh this is a really important message um everyone should feel empowered\n'em to report they should be proud to report\nUm they should feel secure in reporting a and when you are a when you're wondering whether or not you should report I think about uh why you would do this right it's for your friends it's for your family it's for your community it's because it's the right thing to do\nUm and and never think of the bystander effect yeah I'd never assume at your neighbor never assume the person next to you on the sidewalk is going to report it again was plus about a couple of times I Believe law enforcement rather have five calls on something that's potentially a you know\nUh you know terrorist related or they're not had any um\nYou know it's really\nOne thing we like to say is a homeland security begins with hometown security mhm um and and so it's all important we know our local community as best we should feel proud to protect that and keep those secure\nAnd uh you know we really believe that um alert communities are informed communities a Jew player that role and keep your nation safe\nUm and and everyone can play their own role\nUm as we've talked about uh we'd like to say protect your every day yeah and again that's your normal routine or that is a\nYou know your your everyday local community that was great slogan yeah ... and the last thing I'll just say is you know\nWe have rape partners across the country\nUm that we work with and we couldn't spread this message or affective Lee without them so or whether it is a fortune five hundred companies whether it is national sports leagues whether it is a institutions of higher education\nOr whether it is many companies like I heard media or we rely on people and entities across this country a big and small or to spread this message um St Louis governments\nAnd uh we are so appreciative of everyone's efforts and then just remember that this year September twenty five is our first or\nA ... a national if you see something say something awareness day and I'm really excited about that and hope that that further emphasizes important message that that we try to spread throughout the rest of the year\nYeah very good and also encourage people to take that challenge of\nYeah ... like that I think you have to go back in may have to redo it Bernie\nI'm going to definitely go back and redo it\nDealer price campaign manager for the if you see something say something campaign of the U.S department of
