{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "When you're looking for a long term market to invest in you should be looking for a market in middle range of rent growth and rate growth in value growth\nAnd the theory is if you were in the booming markets like in the past we've had Florida was booming California's blooming or whatever or Phoenix for a while is booming back in two thousand six two thousand seven they were just on hooked\nUm those booming markets are the ones that are most susceptible to any type of a recession that those numbers will come crashing down because they're ballooned numbers are artificially too high\nThen to say if you're in a really deep recession state\nRight um the question is will it come out of that recession or not how long before it comes out of that recessed condition a ... and that might be it ever right so if you got very low and sluggish growth you may get no growth at all or\nIt might end up like Michigan did for a while or Indiana Gary Indiana Detroit somebody's places um where the city's almost closed down some percentage of the whole city and you could lose everything so what they're sayings moderate growth cities down they go on to bring up\nThis next term that's rather interesting to see if I could find that term fruit quick and that is um income pricing calculations and what they're saying is\nWhat you look for what they're looking for for their long term investments is a city where the cost of living\nA is equivalent to the growth of single family or multi family housing costs of housing let's just put it that way [noise]\nSo if you live in the city where you can work an average job and afford to pay an average housing check bill income red mortgage whatever\nThat is sustainable that area will continue to grow at a moderate rate of growth but a sustainable rate of growth for a long period of time it's not blowing up and it's not dying\nSo that's what they say they're looking for and they're basing it off this ratio between income and housing costs so I thought about that for ... you know\nI I I've seen when you get in the bottom and\nGet into an area that bought into that area and did nothing for long periods of time of of also bought into areas that were down that gave me an opportunity for good growth because maybe the ... the area was in transition maybe it was an area that was what they call re gentrifying changing\nRepositioning itself\nI'm I've been in areas that were overheated\nAnd I've never really liked overheated areas because you pay way too much to buy stuff and so I've never really bought into I mean I've seen him not been in him but I've seen him in I got out of always got out right when things get super super super hot because to me rule number one is don't lose money\nAnd if there's going to be a you know there's going to be a bust I don't want to be in that asset when there's a bust on that asset so when things get super super hot I tend to sell take my profits you know and hey wouldn't it be great if you could know when the market was coming up\nGet in and stay in it until he got up to just about where it got too hot and get out\nThat's been my success for twenty seven Thirty years who investing in real estate I get in when it's low to moderate and I get out before it becomes fire hot so I never uh buying speculation\nRight I'm never buying speculation yet over the past years I've learned because when I first started I bought really low price really bad area of properties I've learned that that's not that good either\nBecause the problems and the challenges with those areas are not worth it in the long run I did my best on my moderate properties all the stuff I bought in the middle\nEast and it was beautiful stuff and it started in Nineteen Seventy eight construction\nAnd went all the way to Nineteen eighty five construction Seventy eight eighty five those eras those modern ... which were either see will be product seeded the product\nIs where I made my kill that's where I got rich quite honestly I my millions came from those properties that era and so I tend to lead these guys have got it now they've given us ten areas they think are the best possible see if we get enough time to get through these ten\nA number ... ... what I don't know if they're in particular there's got ten that are best Las Vegas\nA has eight percent price increase in two thousand sixteen eleven percent two thousand Seventeen has a one percent variance between housing costs\nAnd income Sacramento, California had a southern ... percent last year ten percent this year Minneapolis, Minnesota had five percent last year ... percent this year a Ogden, Utah\nWith ... eight to ten for work with nine eleven\nGrand Rapids went from

ever make\nWhat risk do you have when you buy out for one\nYou have risk of market value lost\nA lot of people learned that in two thousand eight right many people thought that there was no significant risk from home values going down but that perception has now changed\nAnd what about risk of property loss flood fire and those dreaded earthquakes that we seem to have every five minutes around here when storms and that\nThere are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment other properties you don't have the same risks if you own a car about an airplane\nIf you're on an airplane or about my condolences but anyway if you own any other property with significant value there is a risk of loss when you're on something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you probably know the answer insurance right\nInsurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they were probably never use so why would you buy insurance on your home you might say well I have a loan on my home so I have to buy insurance on it\nWell that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for would you still buy insurance I think you probably would why\nWhether you realize it or not you would buy insurance on your home because of something called catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that you have a chance even if it a small to lose a lot of value in other words money\nIf something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our homes is because the cost of insurance is very small\nCompared to the last we might incur if a catastrophe happens so for the fun of it let's let's assume you live in a modern home up to current building 'cause you don't smoke and fall asleep in your bed you don't light candles and leave them unattended\nAnd you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen if I'm describing you there's a very small chance your house is going to catch on fire even so I bet you have home insurance and the reason is because losing your house\nWould be a catastrophic financial last so the relatively small cost of homeowners insurance is worth paying for am I right well you know I'm right\nBut let me ask you another question why don't you have insurance on your retirement money shouldn't you\nShouldn't you call us now for free copy of are a hundred and Fifteen page save money

I Want to make them offered [noise]\nHow low can interest rates go CDs money market accounts and checking her savings accounts seemed to be the way banks give us the short end of the stick these days

accounts [noise] have you ever heard of triple compounding when you can get interest on interest interest on principle\nAnd interest on taxes you would normally have to pay if money wasn't a bank account we don't let the bank to give you one percent of all taking your money to issue credit cards with Eighteen percent interest rate and we call now for rates up her three percent or more tax deferred on your short term save money when you went out one with the seven seven\nI'm going to let you in on a big secret and I'm going to tell you don't tell anybody by the way I'm going to tell you the purpose of money\nAnd I can just about promise you that you've never heard anybody tell you this but before I Do now it'd be a great time to call for my free save money book and save money kit and if you want Germany to grow why not have it grow at a guaranteed rate of up to six percent\nCompound it for a lifetime of income\nYou cannot outlive call now at eight seven seven five for eight safe that's eight seven seven five for eight seven to three three\nSo what is the purpose of money it is very simple yet profound if you understand what I'm about to explain you can live out your retirement with less stress and more comfort and you ever thought\nPossible there are actually two purposes for money only to know more and no is the first purpose is life and the second purpose is that\nI bet you've never heard that before I'm sure everyone you're listening to er taken advice from has always tried to tell you about growing your money but it was never told you about the purpose of money so what does that mean a purpose for life or for that\nWhen I say that one purpose for money is life I mean that you are going to use the money while you are alive in our business we call that income duck right with income no matter how you look at it if you spend the money while you're alive\nYou're taking income from that money for the purpose of life\nWhen I say that another purpose for money is that that means that you are going to use the money once you are dead or you're not actually going to use it but we call that legacy in other words you aren't going to pass the money on to your heirs\nAfter you're gone now it's critical your financial planner understands the importance of creating strategies for both the purpose of life and that\nSome strategies work better for income and others worked better\nFor legacy but the ideal strategy allows you to maximize your income while protecting your legacy just in case you don't live as long as you hope to that is why you should call me now at eight seven seven five for eight safe\nThat's eight seven seven five for eight seven to three three I Am an expert at no market risk strategies that will provide you the maximum benefit for life or death\nYou can call now or any day of the week for my three hundred and Fifteen page safe money book and save money kit that's a hundred and fifty pages of everything your broker does not want you to know called eight seven seven five for eight safe or\nIf you're spelling challenged that's hate seven seven five for eight seven to three three so like I said there are only two purposes for money spending the money while you are alive or leaving the money to those left behind\nBy far the most significant purpose of money is income is one thing to not leave your beneficiaries any money when you are gone\nBut it is a disaster if you outlive your money\nIn fact studies show that outliving retirement income is feared more than that or public speaking not the purpose of your money is income\nThere are only two plans for that purpose one is called applying for death\nAnd the other a plan for life and if you have a broker or a financial planner that is it an expert and plans for life\nI'm certain you were on a plan for that\nWhat is a plan for death when it comes to retirement go well here it is you save up your money and invest it and something that provides a hypothetical non guaranteed right of return or short term guaranteed ready to return in other words you have no guarantee for long term growth you might hope\nFor seven percent compound growth but after fees and market crashes and rate explorations and so forth you have no idea what kind of return you're going to get in fact\nYou don't know if you're going to get any return because the next two thousand eight might be right around the corner you save up your money hoping it grows\nAnd then at the point you decided to retire you start drawing income from your house how much do you draw for present three percent five percent or do you just drop out them out you need and hope for the past the problem with this plan is that your hypothetical growth\nIs combined with an arbitrary spend out of your retirement accounts you have no idea if the plan is going to work\nBecause you don't know how long you're going to live\nIf you die sooner than you thought you spent too little\nAnd if you live longer than you thought you will probably run out of money before you die in order for this plan to have any chance of success you need to plan on dying by by a certain age that's why we call it applying for death do you want to plan on dying by certain age\nDo you want to plan on dying or plan on living in a second I'm going to tell you about a plan for life\nAnd if you want to find out specifically how one no market risk plan for life would apply to your retirement call me now and I can show you a better way to live away towards a lifetime income account that isn't wasted away by fees that comes with up front bonuses of up to ten percent\nWhich will never show any market losses no matter how the market falls and provides you applying for a living as long as possible call now

video games\nSomething terrible is about to happen and like you said it's been a long strange history the first one that they developed within the early fifties and at the time they called it ... which was a mixture of the words\nControl of electromagnetic radiation and what this would deal with upon activation\nOf this warning system all the radio stations across the country would either shut down or switch formats over to a broadcasting from the same two channels and it would be a recorded message from a guy who was a TV personality at the time and best friends with President Eisenhower Arthur Godfrey and he was a trusted voice he would\nRecord this public service announcement and there are no copies of his audio by the way I Love that very mysterious and basically just wanting everybody to stay calm and that Americans will survive whatever the nuclear war is going to have that\nKind of like what happens now with the emergency alert system just a voice comes on and says hey it's an emergency be comic cetera et cetera but this one was just funny because it was tied to TV personality Arthur Godfrey yeah so that was early on in the fifties and then another system that they had which I kind of thought was totally ineffective and I guess that's why they cancel it\nWas they were setting up this system of ... and pink balloons what was that\nThey did it in a really small concentration 'cause this was just a test let's has never anything that was major Lee rolled out but in a small town of Charlotte, Michigan which happens to be near a civil defense agency headquarters at the time\nThey set up with five hundred warning generators and with us they distributed to just over like a thousand devices to everybody in the town and\nThey were to plug this into one of their electrical\nBut let's and then when they did the tests with a system basically all the outlets started buzzing yeah and you were to go I guess your backyard and release a pink balloon and Annette pink balloons are supposed to signify that something terrible had happened\nI mean that's a totally crazy you can't trust people to be reliable enough to do that but it was supposed to alert Ninety percent of the country within thirty seconds that something crazy was going on but there is no message attached\nTo it it's just speak balloons that means mass hysteria would break out so they cancelled that program 'cause it was going to be totally ineffective and then around the time of Nixon there was a new system that they're trying to get set up\nRichard Nixon and LBJ wanted to develop their own version of it which they called the decision information distribution system\nThat did device hand what this was is it something that you can plug into your TV like think about a fire stick in the seventies basically the same concept and so you plug into your TV and what it would do was change the channel if you had some kind of warning set\nFrom Washington they would get on all the TVs and chant automatically change the channel to everybody be watching the same program informing you of what's going on it\nBut at the same exact time that this was happening and this is what's leading as to what happened yesterday the public lost all trust with the government because of what happened with Watergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their ...\nAnd as you said people were kind of mad they don't want the president to be able to buzz your phone whenever he wants to just to clarify if not the president sitting in his office and saying\nI'm going to say now this alert no ... there was a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that\nSo you know there's this long history that we have in this country of these emergency broadcast system\nThis was a new one I think it's actually a good idea everybody always has their cell phones on it were hyper connected you get notifications on your phone you can turn on TV and obviously if something's breaking it's gonna be on a news station\nBut it is good to have something direct when you're in your car you're just walking out for a hike it's good to have it come to you personally it's really about how they use it and then obviously what the emergency is hopefully aliens don't invade us\nRight in the event that something were to happen and we get these alerts they say Americans have about eight to twelve minutes to seek shelter before something happens\nAnd in a life threatening situation that could help we just don't want to mess it up like Hawaii did the last time zone in combat attack was half forgot about that there is a long strange history of emergency alerts thanks Miranda think he wants to go and\nYou're listening to the daily diving

weekend edition next up is my favorite story of the week really I Love stories about bank robbers and bank robberies\nIt takes a special person to have to go through all this stuff to finally come in and say I want to Rob a bank and then research and figure out how you're going to do it this guy in particular has an interesting story he won the lottery hit it big one Ninety million dollars\nAnd then blew through all of it he fell from the highest of highs\nAnd out of desperation turned to robbing banks Miranda you were actually lived in the area where some of the stuff was going around\nSanta Clarita native and I think like five out of his eight or nine banks that he hit were in that town and that's my home town so that's all anybody was talking about on Facebook for weeks

when it's happening locally especially for you you know you think\nHave I ever run into that guy have I seen that getaway car and that's why they named him to peachy crews are bad it it was his getaway car use the stolen money that he got from the banks to buy this getaway car so we spoke to Natalie O'Neill she's a contributor to the Daily Beast and we started off by asking who was the P. T. crews are banned it Jim Hayes\nOh Kim have was a security guard hills back in the late nineties one Ninety million dollar in California state lottery and then over the course of the next decade sort of amazingly I managed to\nLose it all and then after everything it all came\nAcceptable bank robber got away with ten of 'em in the LA area before he wouldn't then caught by the FBI last year\nSo I had been talking with Hanna he's in prison al and writing letter so he kind of ended up telling me everything that happened in between the time that he won the lottery and started kind of life of crime\nMy first question here is how do you strike up a relationship with a former bank robber guy in prison how do you broach the subject of tell me your story\nI called his lawyer and we had gotten her pour lawyer then told me you know\nShe can they be the kind of guy wouldn't mind telling his story\nSo why don't you send him a letter in prison and just a sign up for it he had already pled guilty I was waiting for\nSentencing carrying a point that eye contact with him though who basically before we started talking wanted I wanted to wait until he had been that test and K ... than the article came out that he felt like you know maybe made him look bad so basically I just wrote him a really personal handwritten letter saying\nMore so than the money ever did and that's why I mean I Love these stories it's\nThat rise and fall it's coming into something and you know everybody internalize as like what would you do how would I react this happened to me and it's just a crazy story from\nBeing on the highest highest to being so desperate that you have to turn to a bank robbery and then obviously you know you get caught you know nobody ever gets away with anything at the end of it Natalie O'Neill contributor for the Daily Beast and freelance journalist thank you for joining us okay [noise]\n\nDon't forget to join us on social media app daily got pot on Twitter and daily podcast on\nLeave us a comment if it's raining and tell us the stories that you're interested in\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts [noise] I'm Oscar ... and this is the daily died weekend edition [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition I'm ... and we're running down some of the top stories of the week [noise] don't get to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nNobel Prizes were also being awarded this past week\nOne of the more interesting a Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in medicine physiology or medicine and went to two people Dr James Alison and test Sudoku hung Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs him you know therapy it's quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking who are these Nobel Prize winners James Alison ...\nBoth of them have specialized in immunology studying the body's immune system this turned out to be a critical\nPart of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective are effective in certain situations but\nBut it can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells in the body along with cancer cells will so that causes that causes all sorts of complications going back about Fifteen Twenty years\nThere was another ... Vance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutations in cancer cells now this immune based approaches sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating catcher in the long time\nThese two scientists working separately but in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that if used certain kinds of drugs to target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells the cells or form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nYeah I mean what's so interesting about what they discovered was that the body's immune system has sort of its own natural check points or break so that\nIt doesn't go overboard and attack the healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figure it out how to exploit that and so they in some way they sort of latch on to the break about his immune system in a way that helps him escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both scientists essentially take breaks off with the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these like ... you know commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he is key true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think that a lot of people have become aware of them through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter taking the true to an yes for TV commercials now are promoting\nThe use of TiVo and keep true to I think primarily lung cancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drugs have shown some promise\nThe research still obviously continues they're finding out that these things help treat those things but you know it's not a hundred percent success rate so the next step is to find out why it works the way it does work and then who would benefit most from it there's also a costing somebody's immune therapies can cost upwards of a hundred grand per person so\nThat has to be figured out as well but Dr ... himself as even said this is a work in progress\nBut he you know confident in his own work and progressive these treatment says by the end of the century curious could be found or you know just even more therapies can be developed to help out with this F.\nStudies have shown that as welcoming as these drugs are and as much as they represent an advance next drug alone I think for the most part only works in a minority of\nPatients that we see that in these studies what's striking to doctors about these drugs is that in that minority patients they can have a lasting effect that can help people live in some cases for years to the trick now is to try to better predict in which patients these drug will work and\nBy doing things like ... Singh tumors and then also studying different combinations of the drugs to see if like two or three of them together can do better than one alone and as\nYou mentioned I mean you mentioned the cost that approach is going to compound the cost factor than the sense that you that there are huge drug alone is relatively expensive and so combining them this going to be even more of a financial burden\nThese are effects that we're seeing that from things that they've been doing for eight years beyond that even you know longer than that that they've been looking into this stuff specifically Dr Alison the American he has a very intimate relationship with cancer of family members had cancer he had a bout with cancer it's been around him for a long time\nHis mother died of a well known when he was a child and he has these last other relatives and as you mentioned you need a survivor and so I think it's the scientific drive I think\nIs what he credits as the man at his main interest in this but he also has said that seeing the older treatments that his relatives have gone through and some of the complications was sort of an added motivation for him to find something that might be better because these drugs in addition\nTo their advocacy in some cases their side effects are as dramatic as chemotherapy for instance let's not across the board that they do have some serious adverse events but I think doctors are trying to learn to anticipate them better than try to mitigate them as much as possible\nPeter Loftis reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me up\n[noise]", "show_name": "Jason Doyle", "year": "2018", "city": "Oklahoma City", "day": "06"}
