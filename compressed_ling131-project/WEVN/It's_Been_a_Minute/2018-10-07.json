talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's\nYes PR is definitely part of it and another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen

because I had never known that such an event existed it was very strange uh-huh\nChris I think I went I was\nCloseted gay boy in Youngstown, Ohio um I went with a girl and I know it went like home coming in from but they weren't enough at the notable a life moments that\nThey are for some others I'm bringing up homecoming because it's a subject this week of our long distance call [noise]\nThere's there's you know long distance is a segment where we call up someone somewhere in the world and talk with them about\nThe news so this week I talked with two students from Austin high school in my home state of Texas are their names to still get McBride and story ... ... I asked them about their homecoming story or the your average teenagers in the high school band ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nI work both hiding in a corner on your hand oh [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas\nI'm just about an hour south of you guys know where to go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school in shirts for too you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having\nFond fond\nFont thoughts of my days hiding in the corner we\nActually ... at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah [laughter]\nThe Syrian story there are couple and their\nWe just want to say just one of the opportunity to win together\nOr we didn't have to come together but\nI mean we didn't even have the chance for at least originally we did it\nSo you want it to run on the homecoming court as a team but the school administration told her that only boys can be genes and only girls can be queens\nCivilian and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day\nThey decided to have no gender the titles in the home coming contests no ... no queens everyone on the homecoming court would just be known as quote royals\nBut that didn't make facilities in story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it's another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just reading and that well it shouldn't have been at a gym there they should have just made it so you are voting friction equal regardless of their jobs that just shows whether or not that we're now that the same\nOr ... or anything between and it was up to that it wasn't up to that school and work in a takeout couples are going to check out check your guest one couple wants to run together\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff\nIncluding those who identify as el GB teach you plus since the change of soda in story happened dealing with the fallout other students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done that don't like the new policy it isn't that what home coming as post about\n'em outside our stingy order hearing about it the common core that not a very positive what's been the worst kind of comments\nThat originally ... saying that we're that we're not washing our place rational or special treatment and that that is it that river thing where the expectation is\nElecting a check up or is that they were really how come back with yeah\nPeople really think is going to ruin homecoming ...\nIt up taking away the whole her kind of tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be other gender roles for other senior year traditions\nAs well like is there going to be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next\nHi yes actually that's one of the teachers that has been talking joy throughout this whole issue that you write off hand in ... she was but and I can't wait until we get the problem is the ...\nYou say running for prom king and queen how that turned out my goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done from [laughter] please [laughter]\nThese two young women facility and stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support them others don't like the outcome the votes acts and you're done yet that's going to happen next week\nBut this story really made\nMe think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have the school administration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think we're in this period where defining and letting\nConfusing for some people\nI I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older and I'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of
