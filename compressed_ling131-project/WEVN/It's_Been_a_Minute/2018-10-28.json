Halloween candy in every state\nYeah oh my God that out yeah so Stacy I Know that you are for rum Idaho I Am and it turns out the best selling Halloween candy in Idaho your home state is candy corn [laughter]\nI retired I think this is a conspiracy from Oregon [laughter]\nI saw where you're from Massachusetts okay okay I grew up in Massachusetts I've identified as the New Yorker and in fact I Know both\nThe candy is for that and in New York is a sour patches and so is Massachusetts yeah basically you know they let you notice the ... well I don't know if it was a ... or something but there was one that had Idaho have a nasty light as the favorite candidate [laughter]\nNettie light [laughter]\nAll right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy\nOr movies yes\nWas difficulty romantic comedies yeah I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up each other\nAnd we need to miserable people out\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girls private love letters from mysteriously males to Oliver crushes I think it's really cool that you think I have golden spent my eyes\nTo let her out then there was the\nOther one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her estranged father\nThat incredibly drunk that night and I blacked out because [noise]\nThat's what's on the ground and hunting for the fun thing about all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up\nTo all the boys I've loved before and like father have you ever watch any of those movies very okay which to I watched um televised that love before of course so good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely I feel retro about them I feel I feel like\nIt stokes a particular part of my heart same same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get some scribe has to watch comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love\nNice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that tens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix and the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of love very closely\nHer name is Gwen I met she writes for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about it\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited yet I haven't been\nOf geeky now for several days now a ...\nMy knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer\nAnd that you didn't even now [noise] um they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nOh yeah the summer of love was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer\nA that as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even number of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching his rom coms my big question and first question about all of this is like what\nLed Netflix no or think that rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take the rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix they will just might work for us\nI think they just spied on completely underserved market you know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd comic book crossing ... shoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up\nAt the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want like just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you kind of out of luck\nSo for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only\nAre churning out these rom coms are also tacking a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them\nYeah why have the big movie studios at the movies in theaters why they left rom coms\nWrit large I think they're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more Brazilian dollars bat\nGym with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put Graham with anybody like I said it was on double up next why not mhm but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases and tanks and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer\nYou know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband into going to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that wrong comes on her and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars in your lovely ... end up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and\nA frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that going out to\nYeah I'm should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more rom coms\nSupport for ... hours live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or

... Nassar was originally sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison [noise] in the wake of Nassar's trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job for less than a week today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of\nSexual abuse in another ... former speed skater Brady barrel she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager and ...\nSo he helps drive I came in and I to and from practice which both of our families really appreciated and so and he would almost pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to\nThe rink and skate but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rink and skate than there was molest station that happened before and after I mean in the rain parking lots for high school parking lot\nRight he was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year olds Olympic medalist Andy Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brought his mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I\nHome from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first then I mean I can\nPicture clear as day back out of our driveway go down the street stops I take a right and you go to my house and it was like that every time and then one time at that same stops on he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end which in hindsight it's\nInteresting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took office he found he turned to me and he said can I guess you would have happened in that moment I said nothing\nI just sat there and on I Will sit here and honestly say I did I say no I did not open the door and not run away\nBut I was frozen yeah I mean people say there's fight or flight but there's freaks and that's what happened and I remember\nAfter that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like\nA fog or a\nI mean now now we have an expression I was like W. A. T. S. [laughter] yeah you know and like shocked Robert Tonner present\nAnd only ... how would I tell\nAnyone who would believe me what proof have why would anyone believes that he would do you know I mean just um and it wasn't violet in\nWhat we think of as traditional violence so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan\nYou know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so yeah that I mean honest to God that is the day my life changed\nHe would keep doing this in in the ... the the contact become more intense\nBut yeah so so a lot of people say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question on any I never had sex and the\nTraditional um definition effects but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was he wrecked um [noise] and he or touch and\nFollow me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy\nDo see also like getting close to your family at the same time\nI'm very much so so ah\nHe [noise] he had um a growing issue skating and so he saw my father for his\nDoctor for that and\nMy mom he came over to the house a couple of times and ah took piano lessons from my mom\nOh my goodness yeah so have you in your house yeah rubbing Allison from your mother you knew what he was doing to you she did not know wow so how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean\nI think it it was such a time of\nConfusion and\nI was so dedicated to wanting to skate that I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have\nAny anything to barter I didn't have money I didn't have 'em anything the only thing that he wanted for me was my ... and slot body\nUm and um it but it was it so confusing because\nLike I said he wasn't violence with me and he took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming Amir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there's something\nThere not straight they're bent to go left and the offset and so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better and I mean the improvement curve is is pretty deep as a kid\nAnd so I'm as you're getting better that all of those metrics have to change and for the Nineteen Ninety eight Olympic trials Saratoga winter club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training programs sent to the Olympic trials\nSo our coach you also was volunteer had a full time job and a family\nUm he Andy took care of my blades and I mean our coach Andy and other top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out and a lot of ways my mother said if you want to go to a skating\nFind a ride to the rank and Andy was my ride\nDo do you think he ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because\nI didn't know what else that could be yeah yeah because he was kind to me in and gave me things um you know bought me things about me gifts brought me out to dinner I mean so things that seems silly and trivial to someone like just stop for a second\nI I didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere I'm I\nWas mowing lawns and the summer that's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute [laughter] it's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen with other Fifteen year old kids yeah right but\nSo that's what was so confusing about at all also took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long it it was and it still is it's gray\nTwo things one so again I was in the tenth grade and that was when we had home\nGo with actually my date lived down the street from Andy one block away and um he said that I could quote go he let me go I'm so long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go down after party I couldn't go to anything I had to come\nDirectly home and so I told the group of friends I was going with than my day and ever and I said I'm you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the dancing and I go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figure that's fine\nBut it was because he was controlling yeah\nWhen I told my parents mom we pick me up you know the station ... station wagon\nA role in my school parking lots pick me up and brought me home and no one thought anything of it and I have one of those memories in my brain of being in my bedroom had twin beds in my bedroom and this yellow", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "28"}
