beautiful stranger\nRead I see some [noise]\nMight be called the first intimation of strangeness occurred up the railroad station she had come with her children small drawn and her baby girl to meet her husband when he returned from a business trip to Boston\nBecause she had been oddly afraid of being late and perhaps even seeming on eager to encounter her husband after a week's separation she dressed the children and put them into the car at home along half hour before the train was due\nTo wait intermittently up the station and what was to have been a charming league staged a reunion family embracing husband and father became it last and ill timed and awkward performance\nSmall John's hair was must and he was sticky the baby was cross pulling at her pink bonded and her dainty lace edged dress whining the final arrival of the train caught them in mid movement\nAs it were Margaret was tying the ribbons on the baby's bonnet small John was half over the back of the car seat\nStates scrambled out of the car cringing from the sound of the train hopelessly out of sorts Jones senior waved to from the ... steps of the train unlike his wife and children he looked utterly prepared for his return\nAs though he had taken some pains to secure a meeting at last painless and had in fact stood just so waving cordial leave from the steps of the train for perhaps as long as half an hour\nTo ensuring that he should not be caught how Freddie his hand not lifted so far as to over emphasize the extent of his delight in seeing them again\nHis wife had an odd sense of last time\nStanding now on the platform with the baby in her arms and small John beside her she could not for a minute remember clearly whether he was coming home or whether they were standing here to say goodbye to him\nThey had been correlating when he left and she had spent the week of his absence determining to forget that in his presence she had been frightened and hurt\nThis will be a good time to get things straight she had been telling herself while John is gone I can try to get hold of myself again now on shore at last whether this was an a rival or a departure\nSymbols like\nShe'd like to look at him his hair she thought was a little darker than John's end his hands were stronger this man would build whatever he decided he wanted built\nWe need things together things we like both of us small delicate pretty things um I agree with John ...\nShe would have felt it necessary to remark at once that they could not afford such a delicate pretty things and put a cold finish to the idea but with the stranger she said\nWe'd have to look for them not everything would be right\nI saw a little creature once he said like\nA little tiny man only colored old purple and blue\nAnd gold\nShe remembered this conversation it contained the truth\nLike a jewel set in the evening much later she wants to tell herself that it was true John could not have said these things she was happy she was radiant she had no conscience\nHe went to be the lead to his office the next morning saying goodbye at the door with a room full smile that seemed to mock the president the subsidy for doing the things that John always did\nAnd she walked him go down the walk she reflected that this will surely not going to be permanent she could not indoor having him gone for so long every day although\nShe had felt a little about partying from John moreover if he kept doing ... things he mind to grow imperceptibly more like\nJohn we will simply have to go away she thought\nWas pleased seeing him get into the car she would gladly share with him indeed gave him out right old that had been John's\nSo long as he stayed her stranger she laughed while she did her housework and dress the baby she took satisfaction in unpacking his suitcase\nWhich he had abandoned and forgotten in a corner of the bedroom as though prepared to take it up and leave again if she had not been as he bought her\nHad not wanted him to stay she put away his clothes so disarming Li like Johns and wondered for a minute the closet would there be a kind of a delicacy in him about John's things then she told herself no\nNot so long as he had been with John's wife and she left again the baby was across all day but when small John came home from nursery school his first question was looking up eagerly whereas daddy daddy has gone to the office\nAnd again she left at the moments quick sly picture of the insult to Jong\n[noise] half a dozen times during the day she went upstairs\nAnd touched the leather softly\nShe glanced constantly as she passed through the dining room into the corner with a small shelves would be some day and told herself that they would find a tiny little man all purple and blue and gold to stand on the shelves and guard them from intrusion\nWhen the children awaken from their naps she took them for a walk and then a way from the house and returned violently to her former lonely pattern walk the children talk meaningless Lee a daddy long for someone to talk to in the evening ahead\nRestrain herself from hurrying home\nHe might have telephoned she began to feel frightened again suppose she had been wrong\nIt could not be possible that she was a mistake and it would be on a true believer cruel for John to come home tonight [noise] then she heard the car stop\nAnd when she opened the door and looked\nUp she thought no it is not my husband with the return of blackness\nShe was aware from his smile that he had perceived her doubts and yet he was so clearly a stranger that seeing him she had no need of speaking she asked him instead almost meaningless questions during that evening and his answers were\nImportant only because she was storing them away to reassure herself while he was a way she asked him what was the name of their Shakespeare professor in college and\nWho was that girl he likes so before he met Margaret when he smiled and said that he had no idea\nThat he would not recognize the name if she told him she was in delight he had not bother to master all of the past that and he had learned enough the names of the children the location of the house\nHow she liked her ... tales to get to her and after that it was not important\nBecause either she would want him to stay or she would calling upon John send him away again what is your favorite food she asked him are you Fonda fishing did you ever have a\nDog someone told me today he said once\nThat he had heard that I was back from Boston and I distinctly thought he said that he heard that I was dead in Boston\n...\nHe was lonely too she thought was sadness and this is why he came bringing a destiny with him now I Will see him come every evening through the door and think this is not my husband\nAnd wait for him remembering that I Am waiting for a stranger at any rate she said you are not dead in Boston and nothing else matters she saw him leave in the morning\nWith a warm pride and she did her housework and dressed the baby when small John came home from nursery school he did not ask ... looked with quick searching\nEyes and inside while the children were taking their naps she thought that she might take them to the park this afternoon\nAnd then the thought of another such afternoon another long afternoon with no one but the children another afternoon of we do hood was more than she could submit to I have\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout

proper jacket for the baby whether small John might have popcorn when to bring them home\nShe fled thinking I must be with people she took a taxi into town\nBecause it seemed to her that the only possible thing to do was seek out a gift for him or her first gift for him and she thought she would find him perhaps a little creature old blue and purple and gold\nShe wandered through the strange shops in the town choosing small lovely things to stand on the news shelves\nLooking long and critically at ... at small statues at brightly colored demeaning less expensive toys suitable for giving to a stranger\nIt was almost dark when she started home carrying her packages she looked from the window of the taxi into the dark streets and bought with pleasure that the stranger would be home before her\nAnd look from the window to see her hurrying to him he would think this is a stranger I Am waiting for a stranger as he saw her coming here she said tapping on the glass right here driver she got out of the taxi and pay the driver\nAnd smiled as he drove away I must look well she thought the driver smiled back at me\nShe turned and started for the house and then hesitated surely she had come too far this is not possible she thought this cannot be surely our house was white\n\nThe evening was very dark and she could see only the house is going in rows\nWith more rose beyond them and more rose beyond that and somewhere a house which was worse with the beautiful stranger inside and she lost out here\nThe next morning she handed the new flies to the doctor as if she'd done them herself he seemed really embarrassed he'd made such a fuss and he asked her out to lunch to apologize I was not invited\nI never said a word of what happened not to any one I was willing to be colorblind if it would keep her perfect\nI told you she got pregnant just what he was about to ask her for the divorce I shake the next coat and to cafeteria tickets part of the pocket one for spaghetti with meat balls and one for a cream soda I bet she did it on purpose part for evil scheme\nShe isn't looking at me but she doesn't seem to be writing in the register anymore either she's usually such a perfectionist but she can get pretty sloppy if she's thinking about her doctor when\nI asked him if he'd even told her he got defensive and came up with all these excuses they're worried about the boy getting into the right elementary school his wife could go into premature labor he's got some experiment running at the lab and can't be distracted the train got stuck in the snow load of crap\nShe stopped for a moment and I read the label on the next coat she writes that down in the register I think\nThe coasts or in a pretty sorry state all wrinkled and stained blood spit urine tears you can tell by the color and the smell\nIt's amazing all the stuff that can use out of a body one lie leads to another I say\nShe should know he finally showed up past ten last night dog tired for being stuck on the train for five hours he said but I was the one who was tired tired of waiting all that time of running to the door at every little noise watching the dinner I'd made get cold\nShe runs her hand through our hair and looks down again\nHer skin is so white\nHer shoulders really beautiful the pen rolls across the desk do you know what he told me\nHe said he had a lot of time to think on the train that he felt like some invisible force was holding him back that it wasn't the right time and that was why it had snowed\nHe said he wanted me to be patient to wait just a little longer just a little longer\nAnd then we screwed just like we always do that's all we have left I imagine her naked the doctors fingers running over her skin her hair the wet places\nI picture her tongue licking the edge of the blue on va loop who wouldn't want her\nGastrointestinal med too long up demolish the one short\nShort to pick up the pace trying to distract her but she's not paying attention anymore depends\nStill on the desk how could he be so cruel how could you tell me to wait no I couldn't wait any longer not one more day not one more second\nI take the register and begin checking the coats myself trying to be as need as she is that's why I killed him she says\nHer voice is low and cold\nI feel a scream rising out of me but somehow I stop it hold it back\nAnd instead I calmly imagine the scene the knife and her pretty hand the blades slicing into him again and again skin ripping blood spurting but she's\nI pick up the next coat\nRespiratory medicine one long it says\nI shake it and ... falls a tongue\nIt's still soft\nMaybe even warm\n[noise]\nMore in Ireland performed you'll go God was lab coats I'm Joseph ... and I'm Jeffrey Cranor\nWe first found
