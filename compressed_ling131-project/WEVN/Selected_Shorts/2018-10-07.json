removed from freezer and spread with whipped cream let sit five minutes before serving I realize now that\nI should have thrown the pie or at least done the thinking that led to the throwing of the pie several weeks earlier than I did but it's very hard to throw a pie as someone when you're pregnant because you feel so vulnerable also let's face it I wasn't ready to throw the pie\nI should add that the pie was hardly the first thing that I thought about throwing it mark but every other time I wanted to throw something at him I couldn't bring myself to do it\nOnce for example right after I found out about him and Selma I'd been seized by violence impulse but the only thing I could see to throw at the time was assigned ... chair\nAnd I am far to boost walk to throw assigned to taunted anything at any one [noise]\nSometime later especially while I was in the hospital I gave considerable thought\nTo smashing marks head in with a very good frying pan that I had bought the bridge kitchenware company but I always knew that I Would never do anything of the storage and in any case smashing your husband's head in with the frying pan seems slightly to fraud with feminist content if you know what I mean [noise]\nWell even now I Wonder if I Would have thrown the pie if we'd been eating and Betty's dining room probably not on the floor and Betty is dining room is a beautiful oriental rug and I would have been far too concerned about gaining it\nFortunately though we were eating in the kitchen and the kitchen has a linoleum floor\nThat is how bourgeois I Am at the split seconds I picked up the pie to throw it at mark at the split second I was about to do the bravest all be at the most derivative thing that I've ever done in my life I thought to myself thank God the floors linoleum and can be wiped off [noise]\nOn Saturday afternoon Betty called\nI went out for a walk to buy the pie ingredients I took Sam with me we had a long talk about how ... than you'll would be coming home from the hospital on Monday and how much Sam was going to love him and how he was going to feed him some delicious spiders\nAnd we bought food names it was a beautiful day so we decided

in all\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from revision energy a local employee owned company helping thousands of granted staters go solar\nRevision energy is

with flowers and balloons and Jules Leo was the man that mark bought the jewels from and as a result Leo failed almost proprietary about our marriage\nShe and outfitted the courtship the wedding the birth of the first child the first child silver spoon\nShe didn't seem to mind that except for the diamond ring none of marks purchases had amounted to more than a few hundred dollars\n[noise] I told ... about the robbery\nAnd he said it would just take a minute to reset the stone salmon I waited while he got out his instruments and went to work we were making conversation chit chat nothing much [noise] um she said did I Know the diamond in the ring was a perfect stone I said march told me that\nHe said it wasn't the kind of diamond I'd ever have trouble selling if I ever wanted to see it told mark that he would be glad to buy it back for what mark it paid for it I said I was glad to hear that\nHe asked me how I liked the necklace [noise]\nThe necklace\nI said uh Leo looked up and the loop dropped from his eye I must be thinking of another customer he said\nNo no no you're not I said I knew mark had bought me some thing while I was in the hospital so he had bought her\nA necklace for her birthday I was lying\nIn the hospital with a nose and he had bought her\nA necklace no fat rascal I said oh I shouldn't have said anything we all said oh well I'm Glad you did I said now\nI Know what to be prepared for there was nothing worse than opening a box with a necklace in it when you're\n[laughter] I kept talking I couldn't stop once I said I was in the mood for an eye out and mark kept dropping hints about what he got me for my birthday and finally I said I don't care what it is as long as it's not a suitcase\nWas my face red [laughter] Leo was focused on the ring again I board him so thoroughly he barely rented a response he finished resetting the stone and handed the ring back to me\nIt was such a beautiful rang\nThe diamond caught the afternoon sun and made a rainbow on the wall of the store Sam ran to the reflection and I waved to ring this way in that moving the rainbow while he giggled and left and tried to catch it in his hands\nHow much I said\nOh no charge Leo said you know how much for the ring\nI said how much would you give me for the ring\nLooked at me um you don't really want to sell it he said oh no I really want to sell it [noise] I said do you really want to buy it oh of course he said oh I Love the ring\nBut it really just doesn't go with my life it would never have been stolen in the first\nPlace if I hadn't been born this way and if you got a ring you can't wear on this one wants to play against it's sort of like having a mink coat [noise] if I had a mean coach I Would have to take care of every time I'm In New York and the next thing you know we'd be even broker than we are now\nMarkets so romantic he'd probably spent every penny of his savings on the necklace Leo nodded for the down payment\nYou said for the down payment I said it's a beautiful necklace said Leo now have a beautiful necklace I won't be able to wear on the subway either I said\nHow much of the ring Fifteen thousand Leo said Fifteen thousand I said that's what mark paid for it they'll set in my heart started ... pounds\nI realize that I had just been given the means to walk out of my marriage\nFifteen thousand it is I said to Leo\nTen years had passed the cost of walking out of a marriage had gone up I went home with Leo's checks and made the pie\nI was in a trance well I don't know perhaps it wasn't a trance but it was as close to a transit all ever get I was speechless I said nothing nothing at all for several hours\nAt age I'm Mark and I took the pie ... it was just us um me mark Betty and Dimitri who bet he lives with\n[noise] when we got to Betty's mark and Dmitri went into the kitchen to boil lobsters and Betty and I sat in the living room while\nBut he talked about the dance that she and Selma and I were apparently giving apparently we were giving it at the sole grave club apparently the crap man had already been booked apparently all that was lacking was my guess lifts film and Betty had already drawn upstairs and apparently the Kissinger is\nWe're on film is lift justice I predicted\nI sat and listens and drank an entire bottle of white wine as bad he went on and on and\nBy the time out to dinner I was tipsy we ate the lobsters I don't remember the conversation [noise] um I\nDo remember realizing that no one seemed to be noticing that I hadn't said anything\nThe entire evening and that no one seemed to mind I must try this again I thought I must try again someday to sit still and not say a word maybe when I'm dead [noise]\nAfter the lobsters I took the key line pie out of the freezer\nAnd put the whipped cream on it and sat it in front of me I was going to give it five minutes to thaw slightly the recipe and that's when he turned to me and she said Rachel you didn't tell me about Richard and
