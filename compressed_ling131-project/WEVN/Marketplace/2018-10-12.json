I'm sure there's still a lot that needs to be hired out there are plenty of investors plenty folks running companies are worried about how all this is going to shut down then\nShall we talk to me that about why everybody was surprised because rising interest rates have been ... everybody's been known it's coming and yet the past two days everybody just went oh my God that's\nThe big mystery I mean everything that has made markets go crazy this week has been with us for so long I mean markets just completely shut off the trade war right in August\nAnd all this other stuff interest rates deficit everything and I think part of it is we know that this is going on for a really long time everyone is thinking you know there are we to complacent and I think that that's just\nYou know does the market know something that the economy doesn't know which happens sometimes that totally you know I I think the fears are unfounded I think when we see Netflix and Amazon come out with ... in the next couple of weeks I think I you know who knows but I Would\nThink that there including ... everybody's going to go yeah I feel better yeah for now\nI'm a David the president's a chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow made one of his many appearances on the White House driveway yesterday said look the kind of economic fundamentals were strong we've got growth going on\nAnd yet on maybe Monday or Tuesday I forget the international Monetary Fund came out and said hold the phone trade war terrorists were going to take our pick for global growth down a couple of nachos so there's little disconnect there\nYeah I mean front and center here spend the U.S economy has been the Chinese economy as well all these global bankers economists are gathered in Bali for this big concept there ... all this stuff out there right they reduced the forecasts for us growth and for Chinese frozen in two thousand Nineteen um I think you're seeing that contrast that again we've seen for these many months now that you have\nWell respected economists saying they're going to be risks to what's happening here and you have members of some inspiration downplaying those risk it's interesting to the division between those advisors to the president and president south we're talking about Jay Powell just a moment to go to the fed chair you had the present earlier this week casting doubt even answered reporters' question does he planned to fire Jay Powell I didn't know that we've gotten there\nUm so you have a president now watching these interest rates rise fair to say no president wants to see interest rates go up um but there exists still this division between the present\nThose who advised yeah leave that point about uh the president a book and Jay Powell in the ... told me on this program I don't care what the president says I'm gonna do my job but but there is something about um why it matters that presidents attacked us that it's not like it's never happened but but this is real now\nIt really is and and write he hasn't done this before and Jay Powell has actually managed to be relatively out of the limelight since the since he took over\n'em but you know who knows I mean this could be here one day and on the next I mean we just don't know I'm writing interest rates you know it's a good sign this is only good thing it doesn't need to be you know it it doesn't need to be such a bad thing it's not crazy\n[laughter] it's like you're totally predictable do in the sense that this president has hitched his wagging to the store the markets from from day one\nYou've
