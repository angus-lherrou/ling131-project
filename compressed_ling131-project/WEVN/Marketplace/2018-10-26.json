Richardson from Edward Jones in ... Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody Hi chi chi chi ... let me start with you ah and and uh in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a tree she she um Olson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of\nUh the GDP report as deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts in it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the the ... to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the ... and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nMeal it occurs me actually just thinking back to how I open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts and the stimulus end to end the on stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact the blow the fat target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking and that is good as Katherine said because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation do in your voice new\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three ... concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd carrots and trade tension concerned those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and said you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead okay\nKatherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies\nBut it bears leaving them out well well uh [laughter] so so here's the thing just on the street and terrorists and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to get billions of dollars into the United states because of all these jobs not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those terrorists but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't\nI don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists have been like basically\nSaying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the terrorists don't exist it can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nKnew what other item from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed a chaired by Jay Powell ah his biggest uh economic problem I'm even as a German pal told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if\nNow with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about Rachel what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what that is really concerned about is how they keep the economic bull market running how they keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because women as\nAnd we know that it will be all end eventually the neck and recession hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession and they want to do so in in a context of economic growth\nAnd so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political ... of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that\nSweat and has to be negotiated going for a port\nBill Richardson a at the end we're Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you\nThink ... thanks guys\nHave a nice weekend on Wall street today down day that ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think like the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to help and markets go up they go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping right we'll have details when we do the numbers\n[noise] no no\nNo\nNo [noise]\nAnd [noise]\nIn part\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nTo dig a little deeper as we're want to do around here and you could start to separate what his boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drugs last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there so\nHow much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent\nAt the end of you know is chief us economist at ... ...\nWere up pretty sharply together that she nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nThey may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter to spend now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings not McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out tax or farmed for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher steel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers at the impact of starting to bite\nAt least at that country and company level consumers just aren't feeling it yet a majority responding to a recent marketplace Edison research poll fifty two percent said parents have no impact on them personally I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nWe've gotten some insights into the fortunes of a couple of key technology companies as they've reported earnings this week one key insight in particular\nYou and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\nYou know old school sometimes is the better the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you when you need long term archival storage you want something separate it from the Internet and you want something that's going to hold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Gen cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah it's a terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single LTS seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books on one tape among car\nCrash okay now there's a corporate story you're right there's it's Sony and food you film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and they're sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and ... it's called the linear tape open there used to be six manufacturers now there's two and\nThose two have said oh you're using my patents in Latin inventions and the other one says no you're using my patented inventions and each one has filed complaints that the international Trade Commission in here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nPotential courses that if there is only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of the hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the IT ceasing please don't shed either of them out or we want to have multiple suppliers\nUm both of them by the way our in Japan and also there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's not just an army that shuts down operations ...\nGive me the upshot of all these ah shoots encounter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent it seems on backing up basically the entire Internet on on just two companies trip that that seems like a challenge\nIt it is there are some older versions of the tape but the hardware companies they want the newest version they develop the standard and to put ever more stuff on these tapes so the only ones and they would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less data\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\nWill think about it I mean if you have software and there's a bug that's introduced into that software that bug will go on and on and on but if there's a physical version of it on tape than that bug doesn't touch the tape and that's how you can recreate it and and so\nKnow I spoke to a number of people during the reporting in my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running\nWow [noise] Susan Decker she's a ... a correspondent at a Bloomberg Susan thanks a lot of pressure thinking [noise]\nProducts association comes to set up for this next story in two thousand Seventeen we that as Americans spent more than sixty nine billion dollars\nCame from me about six billion of uh do give or take went for services like grooming and training which gets us to the point to a series we do called my economy help people's personal economies we're doing away from the big economic headlines here Hugo\nMy name's ...
