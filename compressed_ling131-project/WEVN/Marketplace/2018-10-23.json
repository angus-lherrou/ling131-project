the southeast this time of year Florence and Michael did a whole lot of damage past couple of months\nNow do consider the crop but also trade policy and you'll discover the tobacco farmers in North Carolina or in a gym fewer people in the United states are smoking of course and most of the tobacco crop is marketed overseas especially China\nBut because this is the way trade wars works China has put American tobacco products on its tariffs lists marketplaces in your has that story\nTripled the farms covers about eight hundred acres in Johnson county North Carolina about forty five miles southeast of Raleigh rate in Baton is one of the owners he's thirty two and runs the form of his dad and his uncle\nThey farmed corn and wheat and soy beans but he says their cash crop is tobacco and right now he's stuck without a whole lot of farming to do\nNormally around the middle to the end of October we would be wrapping up harvest but unfortunately that that was a bit early this year the tobacco that we had in the field was destroyed and forest came through\nThat and says jumped in county got about Eighteen Inches of rain\nAre harvested annually three or four times a year in the last harvest in October renders the highest quality tobacco for baton that harvest pays the bills Florence guaranteed he'll be out that money but he says sales were already down because of President Trump's trade war with China\nLast year North Carolina exporting more than a hundred and fifty million dollars in leaf tobacco to China making China's largest consumer of the state tobacco in the world in April the Chinese raise the tariff on American tobacco from ten percent to thirty five\nNinety percent of what we grow as for export and not only this year we face and possibly reduce sales and reduce market process because of the Chinese terrorists were also looking at potential contract cuts for next year\nBecause of this year's crop can't be sold it'll remain on the shelf until it's

devastating\nGranted baton is the sixth generation and his family to farm says it's in his blood but he's got a young son and twins on the way so he's struggling to decide whether farming is still a viable way of life\nI did want to foreign because I Love it I have a passion for it but at the end of the day I Can't do it for free because I have to support my family too and I think there's definitely a struggling something there's always on my mind\nHe says if he does keep farming he'll consider changing what he plans to better reflect market shifts\nTobacco is our cash crop but you know way of talking about other things he is obviously on the horizon with the new farm bill it could become technically legalized so that you can grab you and I think that's an exciting new potential market\nBut changing what you farm isn't something folks in North Carolina can do immediately tomboy key says some politicians understand that he's a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations
