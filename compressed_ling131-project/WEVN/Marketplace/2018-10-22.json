L. C. [noise]\nIn Los Angeles I'm ... result is Monday the day before the second of October get is always to have your long everybody\nYou know of all the topics that economic Washington deals with at a policy level few of them bring with them more wailing and gnashing of teeth then these two seemingly simple words currency manipulation the subject comes up every six months Treasury Department is required to put out a report listing\nThose economies that are manipulating their currencies to gain competitive advantage but really here\nWe are talking about one economy right China that as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not\nSay Beijing is manipulating its currency\nBut that did not end the wailing and the national over the weekend treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he might actually consider changing the rules the department uses to decide whether countries are playing fast and loose with the foreign exchange markets so we asked marketplaces Tracey Samuelson why all the for X held up\nAs far as current global economic issues go currency manipulation no super high unless\nThis is not something that very many countries\nHave done historically and not something many countries are doing today\nDavid Steinberg is a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins [noise] but if you worried as the president does that other countries so more to us than we do to them then you worry about the ways that exchange rates can make those foreign goods even more appealing Matthew Goodman is with the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThere is a close relationship between currency and trade policies\nThing is going to China isn't currently devaluing its currency for competitive advantage\nThey don't you know clearly meet the test of manipulation at the moment\nAnd anyway the label just doesn't pack that much punch feels legal at the University of Maryland\nIs kind of a strange tool because if we deemed China to be a currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics Derek scissors with the American Enterprise Institute\nRemember the president said he recalled trying to crunch him and I put on day one we've now gone through four rounds of reports where they haven't called them courage to manipulate or and you know their reasons for that but that's not what he campaigned on\nWhich could put him on the defensive on the next campaign trail I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nA detour now to personal finance and that all important credit score they can weigh heavily on people's economic wellbeing psycho what'd you short for fair Isaac corporation in case you didn't know it Richard credit history and gives you said score\nBut nobody said this morning it's coming up with a new number new product if you will somebody called ultra psycho for people who don't have much of a credit history to begin with\nOr who maybe didn't have the greatest credit in the past marketplaces ... short has more now on who stands to gain from that\nIf you don't have a credit history it's kind of hard to get a credit score like it's hard to get a grade class if you've never taken any of the test so what if I go is doing instead with ultra psycho is looking\nYour credit history to figure out how credit worthy you are\nThat includes not having a history of negative balances having savings and trains acting responsibly\nSally Taylor is scores vice president at psycho she says you have to volunteer this information willingly it's not automatic there are fifty three million people in the U.S who don't have a credit score students are immigrants for example\nIt's cooler will tap into another ten to Fifteen now and we estimate that fifty three now\nThat's of course millions more people for lenders to lend to answer if I go to score Taylor also says this will raise the credit scores for some people jak Gillis is executive director of the consumer federation of America\nThe folks that will benefit the most from this are those folks who have marginal credit scores or who don't really have much credit\nBetter scores can save people money they affect your insurance your car loan your mortgage now the question for any new type of credit squared though is is it accurate Jonathan glow he is a principal a consulting firm ...\nSo it's very easy to create credit scores when the economy is going well in default or very low where the robbers going to hit the road is really when we hit the next rough patch\nThe next recession is when you find out which loans should not have been made in New York I'm Sabrina short for marketplace and that always the way on Wall street today that name is volatility will have the details when we do the numbers\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThere are in case you somehow haven't been keeping track Fifteen days until the mid term elections\nAnd while acknowledging that past performance is no guarantee a future results if the next two weeks or anything like the past couple of months who boys a lot of political money going to be spent the center for Responsive Politics figures five billion dollars from all sources\nIs going to wind up being spent on the two thousand Eighteen congressional elections a lot of it coming from well shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplaces Justin ... has that one\nOne of the reasons there's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because billionaires alleging more of their cash and politicians\nThis is something that sort of arose out of than normal sports and is being made or the last few decades\nThat stand for political scientist Adam Monica he found that the total wealth the Forbes four hundred jumped eleven to fold since Nineteen eighty two and the amount will be people spend on politics has gone up in proportion historically he says\nPretty clear that there was a lot more money coming from very wealthy conservative\nLike casino mogul Sheldon Adelson he's or thirty four billion dollars and he's a staunch supporter of Republicans in pro Israel issues after giving Donald Trump twenty five million for his election eat as much from the front row as the president celebrated the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem\nThis year it'll send and his wife pony up eighty seven million dollars to conservative groups and candidates the lately but like I said many billionaires are leaning another way in\nOver time it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going to the Democrats\nConservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up but like I says that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley\nDustin Moskowitz the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million to groups like move on dot org can a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years his let more people in general to contribute\nI feel this is an emotional need for people to engage\nThat's ... next Gen America that's the political action committee run by\nDire hedge fund billionaire from San Francisco you might know style from his controversial ad campaign to impeach the president which hasn't been uniformly popular with Democrats\nA Republican Congress ones impeach the president for foreign let us get today\nTires political groups are spending a hundred and ten million dollars I'm liberal causes an east coast billionaires are spending a lot to Boston based hedge fund managers step climbing recently announced he'd donate twenty million to help elect Democrats after years of supporting the GOP\nFormer New York city Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged a hundred million to help elect Democrats that could prove useful as Bloomberg eyes a democratic presidential bid and twenty twenty\nContributions Bloomberg's a pretty easy to track but then there's what's known as dark money\nThat we're seeing the spending side that we don't necessarily know who would actually behind it and a lot of the cases\n... research is dark money at the center for Responsive Politics a huge chunk of the spending goes to advertising and depending on what the ad say she says their funders don't always have to be disclosed\nSo it makes it hard to tell whether it's a billionaire spending or a corporation or anyone else\nShe said Democrats are collecting more dark money from donors in recent years perhaps to avoid the stigma associated with big money in politics but she says high profile billionaires tend to operate in the open\nAs they get more money in that condition that groups at least get more disclosure whether that be I think that the puzzles or their reaction to that being that they do start disclosing that wire\nAnd um they find the company brace herself a forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like Sinclair\nA word here in defense of the Federal Communications commission or Sinclair has one it's about Tribune Media for a while they had a deal and just recent well a number of months ago but recently in relative terms\nAre determined to actually she did pie ... I'm not going to let that happen\nThe Tribune merger was sort of fascinating little window into the business in regulatory environment that has sprung up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith end up Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago I G pie announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of doing that\nBut what we've learned since then has Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort\nTo appease their regulators and get their deal approved\nAnd they had had such success for such a long period of time that they figure the odds were in their favor\nThe trick had worked in the past and the number of regulatory experts I spoke with said well it's sort of one thing to try and pull off that trick with the champagne bastards when you're a much smaller company but once you are the largest company in the country and you're you're about to become even larger\nThe government's going to take a closer look and even in this incredibly friendly environment what they were trying to do with so brazen that the FCC had to put a stop to it\n... a staff writer for the New Yorker running most recently about Sinclair broadcasting company also are you here every now and then I thought it would have to do is excellent\n[noise]\nOn the theory that knowing industry no matter how or how potentially big issues is immune from disruption\nCast a glance now toward recreational marijuana if you would it legally nine states including here in California home to what is widely expected to be the biggest legal recreational pot industry in the country and\nAnd this is not unrelated also home to much of the technological innovation in this economy right now David Weinberg reports on super but for pot\nIt's after dark on a friday night a woman who goes by the name\n... is circling a luxury hotel in downtown Los Angeles [noise]\nShe's looking for a middle aged woman with long gray hair capri pants and a pink and white checkered top\nI'm pulling up and find out why staying where are you standing\nShe stops in front of the hotel and ignores the bellhop who's trying to get her to pull forward\nThe woman she's looking for walks up to the car and Hans ... a hundred dollar bills\nEighty five\nGet your hands a woman or white paper bag full of marijuana and the woman tells her to keep the change marijuana is still illegal at the federal level so transactions like this are usually cash only and these days no big deal\nAs you can see it's the norm all\nThere's a lot of people around knowing really back an eyelash\nJust another day in\nCentral California\nNow a month later Geisha whose real name is Mary and co ten is out of a job\nThe dispensary she worked for the downtown patient group suddenly stopped its delivery service they would not comment for this story but the margins for pot delivery are tight drivers are not gig workers but they offer lifted Newberg state law requires them to be W to employees making at least minimum wage and getting benefits and digital disruption\nOne of the state's biggest players in the delivery space is a Silicon Valley startup\nCalled ... we're eases uh Los Angeles headquarters in Venice Beach David Mak is a senior vice president of public affairs freeze the company raised more than fifty million dollars from investors which helps pay for this office space and luxurious home once owned by Angelica Houston\nHe points out employees sitting behind a wall of giant computer monitors\nSo the orders come through the ease platform the orders are then routed to a local license suspense re partner\nOnce that business receives an order ease software dispatches a driver who was an employee of the dispensary not ease\nLast count I asked earlier today there are approximately twelve hundred drivers with dispensaries are on these platform\nOne thing you'll never see at ease as marijuana the company does not have a state pot license and never touches the product to stay clear of federal law enforcement backs at ease makes money by charging dispensaries defeat and taking a percentage of every sale\nFor dispensaries that don't have a lot of foot traffic delivery can be crucial but dispensary owner Jared ... isn't sold he met with ease and was alarmed by the business agreement they offered\nSo it kind of look like we're going to take every part of your business and take no risk because they don't hold a license so it looked like a Trojan Horse\nCarlos says ... only wanted to sell products it endorses and limited his access to a customer data but other dispenser he sees as an engine for gross\nYou know back in the early days it was you know really just we

to sell products directly from their vehicles in Los Angeles I'm David Weinberger from [noise]\nThe final vote on the way out today a summary from the president this morning with lots of helicopter noise in the background we should say so we apologize for that but anyway a summary of part of his most recent stump speech the part where he says he's going to get another tax cut done before the elections in two weeks how is it going to do that\nWe're putting in a resolution sometime next week or are we going to have to weigh\nNot for nothing but the Internal Revenue code doesn't get changed by resolution any way the president went on\nGiving middle income tax reduction of about ... percent were doing it for middle income people this is not for businesses from middle that's on top of the fact that we've already\nCongress by the way which would have to pass any new tax cut is in recess until after the election which the president did finally kind of seem to get\nYou know no no we won't
