of the fifth day of October to does Newt Gingrich has always to have your long everybody yes\nLots of news today we get it but we are going to keep our eye on the economic ball and the ball on this Friday was this September unemployment report it was a good no hundred thirty four thousand new jobs in nearly fifty year low on the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent\nSo we will start there and then merger further or boats farther afield I'd never get 'em right doesn't rebel writes for the Washington both Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones ...\n... ... ... jobs the euro and that means we're going to talk about wages uh uh I Want to point out that ah the Drudge Report was actually doing a little bit of a missile and the number of jobs but but people should be happy with the wages however are another thing entirely still an again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to be a market for that right at wages wages where the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained growth and wages as a little bit lower than than last month that but some growth that two point eight percent it was enough to spark some concern in the market\nThat this would spill over to consumer and prices and and and prompt inflation and cause the fed to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated so even that small pickup and growth was enough\nTo concern the markets about inflation and rising rates and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and ah the president and where we stand it is somehow amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA a China is still out there uh we have a still a president who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions\nYet we have a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with terrorists and counter terrorists and breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built um\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place a plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure\nI is kind of a hill there that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric suggesting that he had hoped to do so\nThat that's a good one the debris globalization Neal put on your your actual certified economists at which I should point out your a and a poet back for me to a you know\nCatherine we're talking about this idea that we are now distinctly trying to go it alone in this global economy uh with um a politics you're being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done and where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's German perhaps for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing which is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened\nTook a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China and the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward but a China also has some solid reasons for pushing back and so as much as markets chaired\nThe continuation of nasty or some kind of knew named as rose that smells a sweet [laughter] um [noise] it's hard to translate a U.S flow when\nIn North America with a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing power in terms of their economic strength and the supply chains in which they are they sit right in\nThe middle of you to have some great launched a slow when that's a great line I'm okay look let me let me turn to the news today because we have to acknowledge it Susan Collins declaring that she is in fact senator from Maine that she was in fact in their vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nJoe mentioned doing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court ah come you know mother Tuesday\nI Want to talk for a second Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean for anybody's economic agenda because there are things that have to get done writer budget to the to get on there are\nSocial programs and and a foreign bills and all of that stuff still has to be done ... thirty seconds to you and then to Mueller where does things were the things that\nI I think the status quo is very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budgets through for example that Congress has to manage our and and the presidency as well the executive branch as well\nUh at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we have so much political dysfunction suggests that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around\nFor the last crisis uh ten years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's going to happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones\nKnew what you quickly for sure and I just want to add on to like cats are and I think just said which was you know this is occurring the ... the political dysfunction if you wanna call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health\nUh a lot of wealth being created in the economy and investors are are benefiting we're seeing some wage growth\nUh what happens when the economy naturally turns as is part of a natural business cycle [noise] well that's when the government plays a role and what we need at that point as a government that functions together for the the betterment of the economy and hopefully by then we'll get a\nRichardson a good word Jones dressing room filled the Washington Post thanks you too thank you I have a nice weekend one more quick thing about the state of economic play right now especially in light of the jobs numbers this morning which as you've heard but unemployment in this economy at all levels not seen since Nineteen sixty nine year old and with what's been going in this week in the bond markets and I talked about that\nThat his interest rates higher and it gets me to this comment from Chris Lowe he's the chief economist at MIT and financial he's also a friday regular on the marketplace morning report which in most markets was preempted this morning for shall we say other news anyway Chris pointed out to David Brancaccio this morning\nThat Chris works on a bond trading floor and the people in the bond markets they've got a long long memories\nPeople are really nervous Thirteen sixty nine is remembered as the beginning of the big mistake that the blood to Nineteen seventies inflation and\nParticularly the older guys out there they don't like the shoes at all and moves and but you know what what I like to remind them as the other thing that happened in the seventies who should oil\nIncrease in price for three dollars to forty you know be the equivalent of ah oil costing four hundred dollars a barrel in ten years that might be a little inflationary to\nYeah just a bit west Texas intermediate by the way Seventy four dollars thirty four cents a barrel today that was ... to kind of miss that at the end financial from the marketplace morning report this morning I thought that one deserved to be heard to the broader
