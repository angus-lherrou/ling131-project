long time ago always does come\nFriday afternoons of late but that's where he got to start if you want to explain what happened in the past five days which is what we're going to do and it Lopez is a business inside originally rooms\nIs with the New York times they're both in our New York studios everybody hey hey she'll let let me start with you or we'll go back to Monday or the deficit figures from the Treasury Department up Seventeen percent from a year ago seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it kinda seems\nA that those numbers of lost all meaning though they are\nWell sort of I mean everyone told Republicans this was going to happen and they did it anyway it um you know the the the deficit is the difference between how much we're spending and how much we're collecting how that continuously grows\nFor some reason conservatives have managed to convince Americans that if we collect less money will have more money against all logic\nSo now everyone's and in the Republican Party saying we might have to cut entitlements because now we have this crazy deficit and more money is going to go to interest payments we can't have that everybody told them from the beginning that this is how it was going to look\nAnd uh it's just sad that we have this kind of weird cognitive dissonance\nIt bears mentioned here not for the first time on the radio program originally rooms with the textbooks have never paid with themselves\n[noise] a right to us so I think the I think that that sort of the great irony and all of that says that um the tax cuts of the G O P pushed through which primarily benefitted or I I guess you should say benefited corporation and a and very wealthy individuals the most\nThat in order to pay for those tax cuts you have Mitch McConnell talking about cuts to rise and rise cuts to entitlement programs\nAnd I think that kind of goes back to the question of well why do we care about the national debt why do we care about the deficit um it wouldn't you spend increasingly more and more and more money you have the the calls to get rid of entitlement programs like Medicare Social security that kind of stuff\nAh those calls get louder and louder and louder because um you know that because at the Republicans are going to be more at least right now advocating more for businesses and then for those programs\nSylvia cynical person might say [laughter] so whenever they wanted to do from the from the beginning was make it necessary to shrink what federal I'm not even able though let's\nBe clear Paul Ryan said this going on a year ago now right that that entitled entitlements where the next thing but rich let me let me continue with completely foreseeable circumstances that now appear on our national arise and uh there was news this week or more trade unrest Wilbur Ross was in Europe complaining about the European trade deals\nOr the Chinese now that is another thing that has seemingly heated up again with Larry Kudlow saying things\nBut we got hard numbers from deep BMW down in South Carolina it's these terrorists are going to cost them a half a billion dollars a year it's not like nobody knew this was coming\nYeah and I

laugh so old now have the Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says this on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment's low we got corporate profits this week went up from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not to like\nWell except for some time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from the tax cuts actually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot\nWhich is an indicator that um maybe things aren't going as well as a as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow um and\nIt also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market's probably going to react pretty badly to the Joe uh enjoy the fun while it lasts a\nOn the market thing which I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now the ... and we haven't seen for very long time\n[noise] yes I and it's really interesting because that the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessors when we have seen depths\nUm I don't really I I and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and fight financial and business experts would agree that the markets are the stock market they're not particularly good indicator up some of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see ah the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past\nYear and these are just mad at falls like a thousand other points that I mean you're ugly snuff and of course Trump used to wait that if that happened to president should be fired ... diary Obama administrator is it I Know ...\nThere's a river everything when you get the last word he got twenty seconds to do it just really quickly the fed minutes this week and and Jay Powell basically saying everything's fine we're going to keep raising ridge everybody stay calm\n[noise] yeah I mean the you know there's no reason for him not to trade change course I think the stock market again is not the economy and President Trump should have absolutely nothing to say about the fat so there's actually no reason for drum how to change course it's not in his data and the stock market should not be something that he's worried about in fact\nHe what the fed is probably looking at is topping a bubble\nOh somebody's phone when officers will you goes you've been doing this for a long time now turn your phones off in the studio ...

downgrade Lardy says Chinese citizen maybe picking up a larger narrative in the U.S that China's economy is slowing down\nAnd the implications seems to be that China will be very vulnerable to the

being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users than a court filing this week sheds new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair walk in the program\nThanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April two thousand sixty ... says we are pivoting video at Facebook and journalism to does what\nJournalism is what that basically and they say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we're learned through this lawsuit ... maybe it didn't work out so well\nSo I I mean I think for a publisher and this was kind of a second costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are these surveys but kind of eating into that traffic so Facebook's has ... ...\nWere faced with that jumping publisher it's like okay now I Know and so they invest all these resources into doing video and then in twenty six twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writers and higher video producer is how this happened to places like at MTV News and having to block it as\nMike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but a ... the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said we were ... were these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they lost in Brazil and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with as many of you count\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go around here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe aren't doing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is as close as they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd ah yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though no one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the news room people were laid off organizations were changed and or I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted um because of what Facebook should do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media in dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think this this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped into both eat what does Facebook have to say first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried claims in the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took them accountability and twenty sixteen when these discrepancies kind of first ah emerge publicly but I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that and it didn't do anything\nWrong and we should say
