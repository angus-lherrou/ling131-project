model prepare stationary leaders to address the challenges of a changing world morning breakfast dot edu splashing envision can't wait [noise]\nIn Washington DC I'm Lizzie O'Leary in for ... it is Monday the first of October good as always to have you with us\nAnd we start today with NAFTA or rather than deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars in New purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\n... manufacturing powerhouse that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it's it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs around the center of the rhetoric trickle of everything and and the and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW\nRight now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico or the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yup boost that up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanctions or the or else that you have to do these chores or else I take away your phone right we see that in my house while the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you made cars and Mexico\nWhere it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession you might say well you know instead of messing with my supply China and finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and his bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent in since uh\nNon compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it\nSo that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico or let's say OK I follow the rules I more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down\nAnd I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour to fit into this\nSo they're still says a large percentage vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen bucks an hour or more so what uh companies do when we just got pushed up will sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money sometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest\nAutomation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might well\nSo looking a little more broadly take off all of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico you know not all off the table um it's a little confusing what's here and what's not yeah\nSo right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security soaked Canadian steel Mexican still still subject to that\nAnd it's more it's complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles coming as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration on that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd finally center sitting here in D.C today what are the chances this all gets approved by Congress well good\nLuck with your predicting a vote on this time next year after the midterms when there's a good chance that Democrats could we will take the house rights and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had a long history question vote yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on a little tab that Ted mentioned on air\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S M. C. A. the White House says the agreement is a quote we in our American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith\nHe runs lost his ranch is in the ... uh Washington they grow apples and also hops for beer Washington state is a big producer of both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers\nWe've had Patrick on before to talk about all this so welcome back\nThings will be glad to be here\nAll right so based on what you know so far um how does this do you look\nOn so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taking away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think the people around you um are you know X handling a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important markets for us agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and\nAh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico hit a selfish to tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the\nIn the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you were on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year as that ship friday sale\nI think we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having really good movement into Mexico and the first\nFour or five months of the year and then this summer after the tariffs were imposed that movements slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting there thinking this is Jess ... again or are there differences that you see I mean how does this plan for you on the ground is at the same thing with a different name\nDoes kind of looked like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us in our businesses um both hops in apples\nAh what we've had last for years and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given you enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nI think we're still hopeful that this is one step\nToward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe Mexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops from around the world and would like to see 'em you know more of these types of deals\nCome a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership a that we've pulled out of but more of these types of deals would be very welcome to buy most of us and in our industries\nI ask you the first time you're on the show in twenty sixteen you were worried about having enough workers to do the work you do and harvest your crops or is that still an issue for you\nYeah absolutely is labor in our part of the country of pure a farm labor is is still a somewhat scarce for us in many other employers in this region\nOr were extensively using the each tree just worker visa program to help me our labor needs and there are some bills that are you know somewhere in Congress right now that would\nMake some positive changes to the program but a lot of those efforts have kind of stalled out over the last few months and so we're hopeful that we will see changes to the program as soon as Congress is ready to act on it\nJust make a contribution at an H.
