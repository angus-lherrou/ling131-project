keeps you up at night but what's your worst [laughter]\nMy my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us and and be part of what we're building and we've missed the class every year for five years\nSo this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in

I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we had three coaches and three years you know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right\nAnd we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are

uncertainty was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away\nThan commissioner David Stern called me and he said Jeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go don't run into the ground didn't really say oh yeah oh my God like\nIt it would break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I ask him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on and I realized that wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kid on the last\n... or want to hear about your family right I mean Dr closer to your brother who work with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book you've talked about it is interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial recalls her and says don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother what's that what\nIt was very very difficult um you know my dad kinda set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and\nAny changes that I saw a necessary\nOne of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player an all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates\nAnd making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are meaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in the question about about making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was the my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because ... perhaps I did wait too long um as you can hear the music or early ... it's it's funny
