recurring editor of the Courier Journal in Louisville, Kentucky usa [noise] over the past six weeks the b._b._c. is following us recovery what are the most serious problems America faces today the opioid epidemic what you're about to hear is or journalists following this story as it unfolds [noise]\nIt's friday the fourteenth of September [noise]\nI'm Laura hunger investigative reporter with the Courier Journal\nI'm working on a story about babies who are born withdrawing from drugs\nMy name is dawn forums and I am an Indian ecologist I take care of sick babies that are in the ICU um after they are born so then you know I see [noise]\n\nNewborn babies are not born addicted that is a common misnomer\nBut addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple facets to it so babies are not born addicted they're not drug babies\nThere incidents that were exposed to a substance in utero\nThat exposure is a long enough lead to a dependency\nAnd because they became dependent on that substance once they are born and they no longer have that substance being provided they become at risk of going through withdrawal and what sorts of um withdrawal symptoms debates so babies have the same withdrawal symptoms as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI system so vomiting diarrhea\nExcessive volume off they have respiratory symptoms so they read fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kidney a which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot\nBut the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their wellbeing so babies are in console of all and crying that is babies don't handle that\nYou and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for hours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick\nBabies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but these little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crying they sleep substantially less than that and then the absence of sleep any of us will get sick but babies that happens within hours today's instead of weeks\nAnd what kind of trend have you seen 'em in the last few years um has it gone down up stay the same\nCertainly increasing I mean we know that nationally we know the numbers are significantly increase anyway we've had a seven hundred percent increase in substance affected infant and the past decade\nIn Kentucky or nationally nationally\nAnd at the trends in Kentucky or probably leading that pack\nUm she's one we go today [noise]\nShe had some problem she breathes in some of the fluids when she was coming out and she has blood on her lungs so she had to come up here to the NICU before she showed me withdrawal symptoms and then when she was up here she did start to show symptoms a [noise]\nShe's had diarrhea off and on and um she as tremors which you know look like she's having cold chills sometimes increase in muscle tone so she defends up ... and her son can live rooting she um [noise]\nHow do we as an institution has been here serving greater move on to sit in Kentucky and parts of Ohio for a hundred and fifty years\nHow do we put over creativity ... conviction and the talent that we have in this newsroom to address the problem in a new way\nTo be able to tell people yes it's a dark morning [noise]\nBut there's there so\nWe're going to the fund rooms\nIt's a room that we use as a a meeting room in our solar room to get away from everything and a clear head [noise] yeah it was a meeting with them a group of teenagers\nTo talk about drugs and how drugs have um affected their lives\nWill use it for research and we'll also use it to help a rich families on the topic of drug addiction\nSo this is a fun room\nIt's got a a game where you can shoot baskets it's got a dart\nBoard it's a colorful room yellow and orange walls and\nThe furniture [laughter]\nAll right so I think everybody is here I'm\nSo we'll just kind of start by I'm Talking a little bit about what we're doing my name is Laura ... we have been covering the drug crisis in lieu of all for a long time here the Courier Journal bath and I are sort of the major reporters covering it but we have actually have a team of\nFour people led by state of Morgan over there\nAnd we want to get students voices on the drunk crisis here [noise] so what have you learned in school about drugs drug prevention and addiction\nNo no no no nothing like nothing whatsoever none of that is not really ...\nYeah they're just they're just basically go over there like yeah their drugs and then you're just like don't do 'em like they don't really go end up and do it they just tell you the basic stuff that you need to know [noise] like yeah like common sense dislike\nLaw school I think they care more about other stuff then uh there was a shop the own stupid things like you all you had to just go eat on his round instead of whether you have something\nTo view us all that all we want to smell like we used by going to say but if you got your shirt off\nThat were there\nWhen I'm In ... as long as people that are that I noticed smoke when the teachers are asking the ... the the little was

can't hold our job or anything there has been through a drug treatments raising him if he did it sounds like pretty much everybody\nI think that like sits it's kind of plague my family kind of thought

know real life yeah which meant to do um regular smokes a slot real fast or someone just especially at school\nYeah you really don't see that at the school day will you be doing it in skipping the ground and how to handle it could have food and drug\nBecause you get sent yeah many people could get drugs tomorrow at school there's too much agree that was like almost everybody Eli I'm not really

conflict and bring peace to off on his son where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies or to help us along the way\nThey know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yeah that's where a war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end uh\nMore now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures everyday and thanks for a reason to support or been helping and equipment and training our security is to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time is it might have so let me ask you some quick questions a pivoting toward you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particularly the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing the U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently to Eric Britain's formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action\nHow would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contract to force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's\nAnd why is that on my ...\nHe had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire wet well\nUntil you and I'll and I'll start because we knew that I don't think it'll take me straight on said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving\nEfforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote ... I had these meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban\nJust uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly ... them an Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government\nHeard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one can formation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report\nAdjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was the intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ... I didn't know he has to be very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't want to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past when the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the ...\nTo be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident uh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are are in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do\nBone and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and\nIt would be a shame that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste I'm just buy a ... through a process\nWhere I don't that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right to stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see where whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in in a democratic process and let the Afghan people choose\nHandler my we have to end it there but I Do thank you very much for joining me on hot dog\nYou're listening and H.

one that doing the wrong thing or they\nAll I don't think so I don't think that's quite the same thing I think avoiding the use of disposable plastic there's not a bad thing to do however I don't know that just banning it out right\nThe board is necessarily going to achieve the most desirable result\nWhile it's not out try it it it it's just in the European Union and surely that's a good start\nNo it's outright inside the European Union what I'm saying is that\nAlternatives we'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling it or just throwing it in a landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that they were single use plastics and a glass bustle you can take back to a shopping refill and using many times as you want to tell them I mean that is the perceived wisdom surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many a return of all bottles in the United states that are about twenty five years whether a lot modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to screw up those bottles up and use them again it's not that single issue plastics should be used\nIt's not that getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nI'm just curious as to what the alternatives to sweet thing is\nI mean if you if you introduced legislation to ban the single use plastic seats in August ... doesn't did a good thing or is it no it's in your opinion\nI don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping Ben should such measures to expand that so that it becomes written into global trade deals that well\nNot just for the European Union then it's certainly not good for the world I Would like to see fewer single use plastics out there right what's ... plastic forks or are going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things of this nature\nHowever one wants has to be judicious about this and think it through\nYou have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less it depends on the energy use of the alternative that's the problem right then\nYou decide to just you know blindly thrower regulation on you know something this is a good example of why it's ...\nIt's just kind of I'm thinking man day out of Brussels that is for people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to to use reusable items again and again or to use\nPlastic I missed the science shows that you are damaging the environment less by not using plastic full surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic folk my 'cause\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and over again to you that getting rid of most single use plastic probably makes pretty good sense\nBut getting rid of all I don't know and that's what bothers me about this legislation because they may be circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more harm the environment because in in the nature of the way you use\n[noise] Peter Morici who's an economist and business professor at the union but University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make of

concerns around the ban on plastic strollers um but by and large I think it's a beyond that it's a welcome development\nAnd I'd also like to look not just a single use plastic but other kinds of plastic that's been the oceans as well so I was really struck by the high proportion of plastic and in the oceans that's due to fishing\nI think twenty seven percent of the ... on a beach is from that and and I'd like to look at that as well as um clean up as well as prevention\nMatthew and oh this is an issue close to your heart's it's a civil liberties issue I think is is warts that boils down to
