that I Believe that we should be quite proud of can't Goodman says\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars ... and that's a ... a a major leaked towards a more green society\nEspecially when we know that the transport sector is a big country it ... into the CEO to\nCredits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thing getting new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives the money to do all the research on have all the\nGreen technology development\nGay Sunday is that I think that because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact do make the climate better globally\nAnd would you be job abroad or we do a better job inside no end up is because we have the money promoting guts to do the job we do a lot of things in the rain forest ... we do look with the electrical cars you know what I thought there was a good thing\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced\nMuch the Norwegian public that actually better that no way does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it up clean the from the ground and where the good guys and all\nOf this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries are in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing fulfill funeral in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy and seeing a lot of renewable energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far\nAs your concerns should the new ... new exploration licenses for it and places like the pirates see in the ...\nI Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seven twenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero\nZero climate got submissions can Goodman says\nWell I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal in the works\nBut I don't know oh yeah we're talking about oh yeah for\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah do\nYou separate Christopher in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw an acceptable and find out what's next danced and and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I thought so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said now China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt will thing that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world's why can't we afford making a plan to get off also feels good son is a\nA would look at the time frame ... college but says well it could be dragging on two twenty Seventy yeah we'll ... it will be like if you base your number\nAgency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big\nBig job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent unless it's a huge huge job ... on on how do you want to ... just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that they need to know is soft and we've been debating and those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce states being built how fast new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types that renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil in competition with the whole as a politician\nAnd in a country like new way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell these ideas how ... does anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working\nEnvironment fallacious for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and it's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you do that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves suddenly you know I mean a lot of people has been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince this kind of\nWe have to look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our place to make their more renewable\nBut where do you get the ... do so well uh you get that perhaps if you're a lucky from ah organic waste and it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our lands part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and if you want to have more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and\nWho are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that a ... that's called at three new now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more\nGay or at the same time we have to address CCS and sees you because carbon capture and storage carbon capture and usage is both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... we don't have which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers do\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like another new regions they stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do and we can do\nKerry who wants to come to his she's yes it's definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway where effort political party actually agree on is let's just explain what we need to catch a storage\nAnd it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now and I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use on the government didn't know what are shifting government so it's been quite a lot a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and his staff has been focused on an alright for Twenty years I think you also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think women know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a

energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in

... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of his other issues we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of a known in Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in into him so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students asked for it\nCan cause ... fault no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to a hundred degree and shift to or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expense and the amount of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to have one I think you've made up here I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't exist sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe\n... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds\nOf ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument is that you will see now that you and your ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by\nProducing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new reached gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city\nThere's an elegy terminal which taking natural gas it's named independence by the president's there because it makes them independence from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the burn seat comes from Homer first comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than old not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat you can argue that new region energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the air and sea have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this expression ever that we need to drill before rush up to set the standard in the ... and see and I don't think\nIt's necessarily get that nor by goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat it doesn't go to the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally sees this summer it is a totally different pictures coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe I guess we'll exclude cold wave to lay on what you mean by the call them price the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nOn the market inside Europe um the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plant in Europe too low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push a cold ... pushups renewables but he\nStill would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to carve improving now but also the way the energy system works and seen through new energy is so much more cost efficient\nWhen it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting guests to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but\nBut this is about what kind of view do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have Sierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector off the twenty fifth\nIt says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way but it's a very poor country Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people in my class or the way in which treats citizens fed the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on [noise]\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep it wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of the stasis is no way\nAfraid perhaps on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you you painting as far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before ... came\n... made a welfare state based on industry when hydro power on maritime shipping\nSo we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas remember your along the coast in Europe or the has the only place in Europe which hasn't been any famine during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins so\nWe built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on and\nThank God we didn't have an ability we we have again it's hurry and since I've\nBeen looking at a lot at the history and one important objective is happening in the Nineteen seventies supposed to keep them moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit that set in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry and so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nBut we also have this
