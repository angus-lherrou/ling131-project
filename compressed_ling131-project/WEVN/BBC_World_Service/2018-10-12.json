... by then Liberian president hadn't jumps in sunny [laughter]\nBy two thousand fourteen ... offering launched a number of goes came forward ... they had been raped by organizations main coordinator

year long investigation he's young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by the public eye and time magazine\nSo this is an organization that was that was set up by American ponder marketed as basically they've been golfing sexual\nExploitation but in the background her counterpart been made about on the ground was exploiting many of the girls and then what we were looking into he's like well what happened to the Gulf delta to buy widespread was what happened then when like a ghost Johnson died and and twenty six the ... what were the circumstances of the vote with implications\nNow Macintosh that you speak all these the the men involved the ... the man who's actually exploited and abused these young women he was in Liberia and himself\nAnd he was one of the

he had\nMultiplied as a consequence of the internationally funded scholarships that on public ... more than the academy which\nWhich was really something that but when the news over over Liberia\nHe managed to get to the east coast to the school and then it was found out that he had been abusing them and they send it sells these quite central to this whole story because how was it discovered

were still allowed to operate\nI think it's challenging because any time there's abuse there's always a community there's always an enabling element from the people who either you or shooting on those who are benefiting and all of them didn't take the steps to safeguard those who are more vulnerable\nBut one of the girl who reports on our stories story when we spoke when I spoke to her she had she felt that she had been abandoned by the organization and this was a girl that at a very hard life a lot of the girls are gone through all of this must be brave enough to testify that that she regret the testifying because she'd been told by the organization that she did everything would be fine but then she felt she was little\nI think the key things that a member and all of this is that there was an imbalance that I'm sure about the ... more than the about resources the west by that weren't coming otherwise they were an organization that was that the help of the food is a little bit of those who struggled to vote but even those who perhaps felt that they were treated badly or they were white or there was a fear that well\nMy story by telling my story I could lose what ... what

think\nIs the most powerful member of the U.S out of your wine and there are certain rules you can't cross in that respect\nAnd really the big point here is that you do not want the Saudis to act the

within the country has grown\nThere was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nAre the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care or so when the ... came to light the organization essentially said and this was in their press statement that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central ... who died an intimate relationship with the wind or they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him by giving him the power to educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school\nAnd then when it came to light he had been ripping these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was\nAnd then how would you do and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be the ... actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that the time and girls who had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know is it to students who are named dozens victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and a meaningful way and uh\n[noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate to the you know if there'll be an any changes at all to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think the after this took place that's certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented a whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two girls for it to the first time according to their statements that the police so definitely the organization type the policies\nBut almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in six months afterwards because of course the blow break hit Liberia at that time and the organizations founder and the organization overall we're courted very strongly by international press subsequently ... who's the head of the organization was named time person with a year\nWithin six months that these rapes in her organization

this week the governmental panel on climate change came out with its latest report I won't be hearing from one of the authors and moving essentially the report said we can't go on like this and if we do what gangs in danger the stabilize the F climate\nCities cars and buses and everything else around me is going to need to be powered by renewable but is that possible what's that going to do to the economy and can we have to kind of growth we've got used to say\nOh well we have to get used to something else maybe something less dynamic him what does that mean that politics can lead it this way down to make big sacrifice that\nWell there is a pretty tough questions that but that's get back to the theater now ... paddle\nA tunnel is Laura ... professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University ... he's the policy director at the Grantham instituted climate change at the London School of economics\nJulius ... he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University I'm Molly Scott K. to an end of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests than a nuts you rebel he's one of the authors of this week's PCC reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to come at a price\nIs the world's on track to me or anything like that target festival on declaring far up the report doesn't call for it\nThe governments have to ask the IPC in two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement or if it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is a important difference between warming off one point five and two degree and also shows demeans in two ways in which global warming can be limited to that level\nI say just to be clear is the well on track to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rule is knock on track currently the pledges of the countries that they have submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions over time until twenty thirty whereas a mission should be decreasing very very deeply a by twenty thirty\nSaid hey if the ... the consequences of temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for example for coral reefs are two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive\nAt one point five degrees of warming it is still possible that some of them survive also for four to ... ecosystems there is a really clear shift in the impacts\nOur primary energies and every kilowatt hour every message will is ... is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys flying\nNot everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences\nHe was putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging to be as one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but he said that you share the how do\nYou show that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable lives how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions 'cause they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible on assignment on American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the ... and climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living stomach and some are life has to provide let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which are often outside the city ... so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term slides\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality ... they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design ... birth lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLords he is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in the sense that the ... will be some jokes that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be loosing from from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand and five to ten ... some people were saying that these\n... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause that's an adequate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of singing next to see the price is that you can't another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people said larger share of\nTheir income is going into entity so we cannot say that there are no losers what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies that will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've are emerging seventies all their high technology sectors that we're seeing in may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term costs and overall benefit\nSeen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get these short\nTerm ... cases I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise and the two degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questioned some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the terms of ... and we're seeing massive increase in the months of renewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to\nBen emissions and so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition to we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively\nAs greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can say the oil financial products or pension products have to be aligned with a one point five powers target for example I can see that and I'm In the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for they say look ahead and they mentioned the world that he is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou know it just went to a to do that when asking the question who's going to pay for\nThis one we should not see\nThis as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one does this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question we're going to pay for it for just one station today one should also balanced is with the question was going to be too cold for future climate impacts if you don't do anything\nSo climate impacts are here today already recon observing today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd read to degree are forming this is not in the far future this is um one point five up the current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to carefully managing managed so that they view the poor of the impacts of this or that they can be compatible with sustainable development and entering a real welfare Laurie\nWants to come back and yeah I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and then that they were just made a lot has been done we have a Ninety nine countries we win evil feeding tired Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are the how the other ... thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost\nThe cost of ... coming down significantly cities is making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance there's a great you know they do is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is\nThat he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize that there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investment changing it is changing and that's the only say it again we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough\nAh as they say the report is reminding us okay but I I Do think this point that he's made all center report about making sure that the most vulnerable are not hurt is not just necessary for ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons I guess only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember the global economy is not stopping and there were three\nBig trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty says you down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double Ninety truly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure\nWe make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the population living in cities around the world is like it's a double in the next four years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to pay not productive for\nWe designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRaw of um the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast for now thank you to a panel throughout the as an adult ...

compete with renewables and what we need to do is is electrifying energy supply and make it a little coping as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that is through a new those\nSo we'll come evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints wanted them is\nWhat they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nation as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything\nThat the scientists could say that would be swayed the administration that it needs to take this little seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\nMyron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president\nI'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that efficient car policies will be effective so they actually used the fact that the warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide gate and of course that trait how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level on in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheap to generate power from other forces such as shale gas natural gas\nFrom the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base which is a olds with the kinds of conversation that we've\nBeen having here it is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including ... industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the or the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them forward or it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big up because of sea level rise is a good chance that the warmer than average Walters and the goals were partly puma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing costs to varying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years in a row try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at the route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nIn low carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas these idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first well the very developed well let's turn if\nWe may ... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the ... the he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo joined I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that is growing\nFast but also a country that has taken\nIts climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to uh some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much\nAs it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future\nBut since then it sort of it's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda is much more to talk about renewables but at the same time let me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands but I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in help\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a fossil fuel and doesn't this come back\nThe politics

G disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on an administrative era and\nNo one knows what happened to him Turkish officials a voice lurid suspicions about murder or abduction which have been awfully denied in Riyadh what is clear is that the disturbing case of democracy ... has raised why questions about what is happening in Saudi Arabia today\nNBS the self proclaimed reform of the conservative kingdom has turned to ruthless repression why well I'm joined by Saudi academic McDowell Rashid I'm a former senior U.S diplomat Nicholas Burns\nSchool of government at Harvard University welcome both of you to ... talk and we must begin with ... he hasn't been seen since he moved into that\nSaudi comes she lived in Houston Bowl more than a week ago we do not know what has happened to him but how disturbed are you\nBy the details of this case\nI'm very distressed and also worried about the hundreds of how the dissidents and activists who have taken refuge in the west from Canada the United States Britain here\nAnd many other countries especially attack the situation has become extremely difficult for critics and peaceful protesters the feminist movement in Saudi Arabia\nEhsan said November two thousand Seventeen almost one thousand five hundred people as where detained according to um have met the man himself but this attack\nPolitical crime I Would call it ... seems a little warning and shocking\nIt's difficult to go there to crime while we still truly do not know what\nHas happened but Nick burns your inexperience diplomat you served as a as a U.S ambassador to use a long years inside the state department I mean just how flagrant violation would it be if we went to pursue the line of speculation and believe\nThe reports from Turkish sources but something something very bad happened to Mr ... G inside that comes to that building\nWealth David if if the reports are true and there's a lot of coming out of turkey this morning as you've seen 'em this would be murder it'd be murder by the government of Saudi Arabia against one of its citizens\n... is also a permanent resident of the United states of the state of Virginia He's a columnist for one of our most prominent newspapers the Washington Post\nSo from an American perspective there's a direct interest of the United states government in trying to pressure the Saudi Government to tell the truth of what happened\nThat denials by the Saudi ambassador to the United states cannot be belief at this point and the Saudi Government has not offered any convincing evidence as to what happened\nBut that basic freedom of being able to open your mouth and\nActually voice an opinion especially when second changes taking place in the country when you can't do that I wouldn't call that tree called\nLet's return to Nick burns if we made to NBS himself and it is important again to think from Washington's point of view that for a long time and the the years that you are a very senior figure in the state department there was deep concern about the degree to which\nSaudi Arabia was exporting a a ... hobby religious ideology which was\nEncouraging dangerous extremism and many other parts of the world was Saudi resources were being invested in mosques and ma dresses and what have you\nAnd NBS addressed all of this and he said the Bloomberg just a few months ago he said look we are trying to get rid of extremism and terrorism without a civil war in our country without stopping the country from growing\nAnd with continuous progress in all elements\nAnd he asked you said with regard to human rights if there was a small price to pay\nIn that area it's better than ... paying a very big dent to make that move\nSurely in Washington there is still residual sympathy with that sentiment\nWell you know the Saudis have always had a great deal of support in Washington because the Saudis have been\nIn the vanguard of trying to contain Iranian power that's been a priority for the United states going back to the late Nineteen seventies so the Iranian Revolution the Saudis more recently under mama been Solomon have grown quite close to Israel the Saudis don't say that openly but\nIsrael now enjoys the best relationship\nPolitical foreign policy intelligence that they've ever had and so you've seen these substantial changes under Mohammed bin Salman but at the same time Steve and I think that there's growing impatience\nAnd now outright anger in both of our political parties in Washington and inside the Trump Administration over what appears to be an entirely reckless inhumane\nBeef steel act by the Saudi Government to kill one of his own critics you couple that\nWith the the problem with the Saudis have caused and the ... by prosecuting this ill considered very violent war against civilians in Yemen with American weapons I think in the United states we're on the verge of a major debate\nAt the Saudis can't develop a convincing narrative of what happened to Mr ... show he I think both political parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which are like would be the right move\nInteresting you say that I was just looking this morning at the figures in the last year the American\nArms exports to Saudi Arabia where some Eighteen billion dollars\nSaudi Arabia I think takes more arms and vote for any other country in the world from the United states it represents twenty percent of all us ... balls and sixty percent of Saudi arms imports that relationship is so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether\nYou believe that the Congress for example is now going to die\nIs really going to happen well you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment of her on but I Do think two things may happen\nOne is you might see I think you should see if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers from Riyadh that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for mom and been solving\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia bought his rule about whether or not he's actually strengthening a Saturday influence around the world or weaken it that's the first thing that could happen second there are many members of Congress who are disturbed\nBy the use of American weapons by the Saudi authorities in Yemen that have been directed a into civilian areas it's been a tremendous loss of life there have been cholera outbreaks it's a great humanitarian crisis and I don't know how long the Trump Administration is going to be able to justify\nThe transfer of weapons to Saudi Arabia for that war which has been so destabilizing on the Arabian Peninsula ...\nIrish sheet we have talked to some length about the number of prisoners that embraces looks out for this and I think you figure in the thousands\nIncluded in that number at least for a while with some very senior members of the family and close associates of the family some of whom were famously looked up in the\nRitz Carlton and including all will lead been pillow one of Saudi Arabia's biggest businessman Nicholas Burns\nOscar interesting question about just how secure NBS his grip on power is what do you think\nWell secure a crown prince who had already guaranteed that he's got to be the future of king of Saudi Arabia would not actually behave in the way my hammock this had man had behaved especially at towards his phone cousins\nIn addition to the ... there was an important ... I've been I've done the whole and the head of the national guard in Saudi Arabia he had a military base and security officials in the country\nYes absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household and the art installations\nBut haven't been sentiment is secured in his position he wouldn't read a result to these kinds of erratic acts\nThe war in Yemen it's been going on for over for like four years\nAnd we have seen no end to the bombing using Weston a ministry equipment and also expect tease let's not forget that are\nPeople from the United states and from the ministry in Britain on the ground in Saudi Arabia and we have had that without us and you can support this war in Yemen with not continue for\nMore than ... because the Saudi Government continues to frame that war in the way the context of a struggle within the region within the middle east between\nSaudi Arabia and its allies and the Iranians a framework which frankly games a lot of traction in Washington and other western come why they continue to be able to prosecute this war what\nUnfortunately that Saudi Arabia is seen as the shield against Iraq in fact at Iran yes it has intervened in Arab countries it hasn't been shown that ground it has supported as groups in Lebanon and Iraq and Syria and elsewhere\nBut the argument that we can tolerate it\nAt a press in regime that has actually gone out of its way to kidnap prime minister like the prime minister of Lebanon and puts him under house arrest for him to resign just this that bin Laden yet another country in the Mid East and president that's probably another immigration and ... and a few gene crisis\nWithout actually they us the main protector of the Saudi monarchy putting as certain conditions on it's on equivocal unconditional support an unbelievable\nWe have to end in a moment Nicholas Burns I'm going to turn it back to you you've talked about the strategic importance of Saudi Arabia if we look at it on one level today we see a young Roula let's call them the ruler of the country MBA masters just thirty three years old\nHe controls pretty much all leave us a power as far as we can tell and Saudi Arabia remains a virus the wealthy oil rich nation which masses ... many other\nTo the the strategic balance\nIn the middle east it is very hard to imagine the United states wants to see old prompt\nInstability in Saudi Arabia the last thing the United states would want to see and I think the rest of the world certainly the Arab world will be instability in Saudi Arabia Steve I think we're looking at\nAlmost the Shakespearian drama here you can see the promise of reform and the acts of reform\nOr by the Saudi crown prince that will take Saudi Arabia forward and then you see a dark side you see the paranoia you see the sense of vengeance you see this unbelievable violence inside the country and the rest of Saudi citizens and the exile of other Saturdays\nAnd and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out which way well this young man turned\nBut certainly the show he event if it's true that he was murdered um this is going to be a watershed moment inside Saudi Arabia and for those of us those countries around the world would have close relations with the kingdom\nYou've been hoping\nFor some sort of change in Saudi Arabia for a long time do you see this is a watershed\nMoment not under the leadership of al ... is it I I've lost hope that that is called for reform in Saudi Arabia simply because we've heard the story of reform for several decades and that the more it's reforms in the morning stays the same and in fact we are seeing what scenarios\nBut we our sheet here in London and the bones in California I think you both very much for being on hold

service Bloomberg in New York before that he spent twenty nine years writing about financing markets for the Financial Times newspaper\nHe wrote a swan song article for the F T as he left ruining the loss of trust in traditional media the immediate response to the New York times story he argues is a sign of a mood deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the rates crisis you've seen trust in the media in the most important institutions that go up the economy you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons for that so plainly the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was ruled on us by the political and financial establishment and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people left behind in those responsible was\nPunished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's\nIn it for themselves anyway as sort of numbing belief that\nNobody is behaving well anyway\n... very specifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had his little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and an unprepared and this to believe actual\nEmpirical fact a lot of that possibly does come from the rise of social means yet but there is a sense now that there is no particular reason to believe\nThe established me general ... in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that somebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more trusted\nThan anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience at the time didn't you when the moon brothers collapsed is actually that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the F T\nYes I had this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis two blocks away from the humans had office it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happen to have a lot of money just landed in my city by your cat because I just sold in apartments in London\nI went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in uninsured deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me were doing the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible protect its by the governments in Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people in\nSmall suits trying to shuffle their money around to protect it\nNow that looked like a bank run technically wasn't they weren't actually taking them on the outs with them but it looks like a bank run and if we

time\nI Do not report to the time it didn't particularly the recipients needs to say\nI'm ten years on because we've had the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting anecdote to talk about an ... by the ... level of invective and the anger vis arose opinion against me was you know at least false one five to one against\nVery powerful sense that the mainstream media can't be trusted if they're not going to tell us the whole truth\nSo people saw it as you withholding crucial information that they should have had access to if you being in that ride a responsible report\nYes precisely so the idea of the traditional media sources like the AFC where I was a viable venue signs acting as a responsible still set of being you'll reliable source that you can go to for information is as if they took his points I think if this were to happen again ten years on\nIowa somebody else would have seen what was going on taking a furniture and it would have been out there on social media I'm ... now regarded as the norm as a baseline of acceptable behavior it's\nJust not just the two thousand ... financial crisis it is also social media that is created this lack of trust and\n... there was a loss of belief in the financial establishment combined with the loss of belief in conventional media these days information gathering is tribal people read the information they're interested in there and read from so we'll see if they don't care about\nAnd when you put the two together what you find is that if a great\nAnd wonderful traditional news source does a great piece of investigative reporting it can still cheerfully be dismissed because there is a sense that everything's through the financial world is corrupt anyway and you don't\nNeed to trust traditional means you have to tell you things\nAre kind of makes you wonder what would it take to budge someone's opinion on President Trump I mean is something as big as as serious allegation in a big global Iraqi might need to stay in New York Times saying a sitting president is effectively\nA tax cheats that the implication of the newspaper or whatever denials era if that makes no impact well would\n[noise] I find it very hard to imagine there's I mean he made the famous comments about shooting somebody and Fifth Avenue and people would still vote for him he was kind of right now the U.S [noise] it's hard to see\nWhat would change opinion at this moment and given that opinion is so polarized and people derive their information from particular associates I remember I sense as a tweet Donald Trump is delighted to tell everybody how wonderfully stock market performances so\nSince that street simply comparing how he had done compared to under Obama and Clinton and it's a done veterans ... and under Trump [noise]\nAnd I go to a bunch of replies say where did you get that from was that from MSNBC which is the most liberal cable news channel here and see an sorry I mean like ... yes yes so you can send that basic straightforward factual information about how much a stock markets as reasons and it will still be treated us\nThe liberal because there is so much talk about a post factual ... but it is so suggestive of a sort of ... and\nYes it's very difficult to talk about this in ways that on a very mixed if there is a lack of trust\nTrust is very difficult to sort of these functions very difficult for finance for folks on there was a lack of compare this to believe anything that you don't really believe also trust others to work in all of U.S interests it's very dangerous\nJoan ... of Bloomberg of course the real test for President Trump will come in November when the U.S hold midterm elections\nBut wow there'd be no immediate political repercussions since the New York times published its allegations against him earlier this month\nThe New York state tax department has confirmed it is looking into the claims and New York city officials have said they've joined investigation to that the ... is a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush the\nBig issue is this is a state and local level investigation and the president has no power to pardon at state and local level it's the New York state attorney general and the Manhattan prosecutor her going after the Trump entities in New York and at that level he cannot do anything\nSo if he really is facing a serious investigation there he's going to need cash\nAnd so that's why I think there is a very good chance that he won't run again because what he really needs and wants to do is to launch what they're calling T. N. N. which has the Trump produce network to take on C. N. N. and I wonder you know it's just why he's meeting with Kanye and you can see him beginning has set the stage or\nAnd he's going to say look I Won the prize I did everything that I needed to do feed that done then there done that and I mean I have a much bigger more huge platform as he says which I think he'll be right about because\nActually having that kind of a media platform will be more powerful than the White House where he has genuine constraints\nBut if he's doing his own news network and that's what's in the pipeline for him I mean if Fox News is on his side he's ... I haven't you know he'll do everything from reality t._v. too political talk shows and\nIt will be outrageous says you can imagine but I think the key thing is the world of journalism is paying so much attention to the Mueller investigation which is actually yielded relatively little\nAnd no attention to the state and local investigations which are much more serious threats New York state penitentiary is not a joke I mean is it or not white collar prisons so that threat is a very real thing\nAnd as you say these are state investigation wrecked he has no say over state if it was a federal investigation he could part and ... is a federal investigation correct so and the way he needs to\nWorry less about that and worry more about the tax investigate\nOh I think that ... that is right and I think it's also very interesting one of the things that Brett Kavanaugh had specialized in was the fact that the president can pardon almost anything at the federal level", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Keene", "day": "12"}
