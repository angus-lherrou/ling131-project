of one student Kelly about civil\nI come from an Asian and acting background and a student at Harvard\nAnd I think I should have credit Wright's chicken is university\nAnd after ... many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case yeah that's kind of action we shouldn't be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but try to have a family of action is impacting different communities and the point of affirmative action has been any support\nCommunities that has historically underrepresented are excluded it seems like it's found Asian Americans right now as it looks like hardly admissions policies are\nDiscriminating against Asian Americans systematically keeping that embrace Lauer it's hard to say what my personnel file looks like a sort of how it affected me that I think the interesting thing is to look at it on the aggregate and how the Asian American population has been increasing in an ACA rapidly but the amount of Asian acting admitted to Harvard\nHas been saying around the focus on that I haven't yet\nSo they have the idea that the students don't mind that speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard and who's in favor of the affirmative action as it stands Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as those just made by Kelly ...\nA ... a her stance makes a lot of things and I I'm happy that she's here um but I think she's mistaken about what the point of affirmative action or supporter of affirmative action is not actually said to\nMake a underrepresented groups uh be more pressing the point of a\nVaccine is to increase diversity increase the benefits of diversity one\nThing that's been that's not been talked about as much in\nThis lawsuit is what it means to have a critical mass\nHere at Harvard and many other colleges and universities are across the country there are a critical masses and quite frankly Asian students um don't have to walk on

students of Chinese backgrounds however for African Americans for looking all Americans for indigenous Americans as has not said this is simply not\nSo you're saying that even ways affirmative action

now this is not to say that there are underrepresented sub groups were going in Asian Americans\nAre among the ... uh uh south east Asia and Pacific Islanders students are absolutely underrepresented um and all facets of higher education but if we're going to talk about Asian Americans\nA as a general group um they're representing well both at schools that don't practice in front of accent and I argue schools that do\nAnd why would that be\nI think there's a lot to do with the caliber students applying um the number of students applying\nUm and what are they able to stop the aggregate their

dumb fellow who saw the first prize go to Troy line Louis can know for the smallest foot and to have motives my for the largest ... prizes will be awarded today for the narrowest ladies waist and the biggest knows\n[laughter] so I Would see it from other spectrum now a century on from when cross ... there's not much has changed when it comes to trivia and celebrity typical central any more it seems like a ...\nIt's all business people mixed facts and fiction Crouse commented the real truth or those that can be invented and controversial pronouncements made by politicians that truth is not really truth comes to mind\nAnd one can only imagine well he was sort of social media and the Internet today but cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only saw models of language and figures like Shakespeare ... many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that um this image as the misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm and its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think a writing ... crosses mine could mean many things that could mean\nNot including a comma due to the editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute their co form one another\nThis for cross was all an indication that there was something deeply a ride and the morality of the author or more likely a one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate what I'm Talking about one of crosses more humorous pieces are set of pieces\nAs what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries manned by the name of ... million heart and cross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of heart in excessively floored pros juxtapose then against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in heart in language but that his language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how crowds seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden do publicity or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they have yeah and these articles are fully religions to classic works of Jim and ... and Shakespeare as you've said and he was a continued the ... tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of a truce or principle you've heard a few these already and ... started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and late to publish them in book for several times but he himself was aware of the limitations\nAn aphorism nether coincides with the troops it is either a half truth old woman to half truths\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man's shows kill me Katrina why was it so important to him\nWhen I think at us had a really vivid and relationship today as he had to he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't go out and and he very much disliked modest\nI'm the director max Reinhardt who was very famous at cross this time in Germany especially um he developed they own a mental showy um productions\nAnd contrary to cross he kind of embrace that yeah tricks of blender\nBut what crossed imagined or was it ... just to stage for spoken good and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama uh itself and the thing is\n[noise] so the picture on getting of crafts than is before the first World War is someone who is surrounded by lots of ... lost his\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably the other choice some punt the others circumstance I mean this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and be fool and also because he was Jewish\nI think uh to kind of reiterate one of the most points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious political\nUm I think that he saw dangers in completely or you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with\nA group simply because one was born into it's simply because cross was born into a small bohemian town or because he was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say fairly deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own relationship maybe you'd better said to his own\nJewish identity um but just to give another camp across as thoroughly booth law but his sympathies in his early life lay with the aristocracy and then as he became more politicized much more so with the working class or in sometimes never with the class to which he\nI'm officially belonging Americans as one example of seeing crosses outsider status at work\nFor all his public pronouncements cross was going to a private money and kept his personal life to himself but we do know that his great love was Disney not hung up about ... and patron of the ... based in a small shot so about a hundred miles south across his birthplace in what is now the Czech Republic\nI'm the only country in the ... what was the relationship like\nOne first and foremost it had to be a secret relationship um they met in Nineteen Thirteen one yeah before the war and a seat in the unit Daniel CD as he called her she inspired cross to write poetry\nAnd he also wrote 'em over thousands letters to hurt you and your costs us to relationship the relationship last it with interruptions until his death [noise]\nAnd maybe it's especially noteworthy that crust he had his hands full with a his work you just mentioned the nine hundred and twenty two issues of defy could that didn't he didn't mean that Danny's case uh he really sat down and wrote like

something Katrina said early across had been effectively against the war from from very very early on and more so than\nProbably Ninety five percent of his contemporaries but his position toward the monarchy had actually changed quite drastically over the course of the war\nFrom what we could call earlier support of the institution to becoming actually arguably it's most ardent critic um I Would actually argue that cross\nAs the war was dragging on especially to not only really anticipate the outcome as it was but that eventually he really desired it because he knew that it would bring this sort of decadent aging and when he saw as wholly immoral institution to ruin\nThat is the very institution that actually ... who's the war on its subjects and the first place\nIn the first few years of the postwar period he became what the scholar Edward Tim's is called the quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes that were transpiring\nWhat concerned cross initially was the economic misery after the war that led so many to become actually ...\nFor something like the good old days the kind of you know make Austria great again even though as cross repeatedly said in various different ways that it was the monarchy that's ultimately responsible for bringing the war which is ultimately responsible for the misery so Kraus as sort of again you know in his kind of enlightenment\nUm attack trying to connect the dots are better than they were actually being connected by many of of all students citizens so I guess that is the thing that cross embrace democracy and even for a while the Social Democrats although that relationship became more tenuous as the twenties went on\nA but he kept an eye a very keen eye on the reactionary elements of society as they were developing even from early in the Nineteen twenties specifically the clerical side of Austria\nBut also so called fringe parties on the right for example even the one that hit the represented and actually it's very interesting that I Believe as early as Nineteen\nTwenty three if not earlier cross was already paying attention to the swastika and already knew who Hitler was and so that's I mean as far as foresight goes are very few who had their finger on the pulse as it were\nAnd we will tend to his view on Hitler in a moment but in the new ... last year that resulted from the ... of the European balloons onto the wool\n... continue to expose what he saw as greed crashed and this and and the stupidity of his fellow citizens that he did keep an eye on the developments elsewhere too and in Nineteen Twenty one\nHe published what was to become one of his most celebrated articles promotional trips to hell now this was prompted by an advantage in his newspaper the trips to the battlefields of friends and company and tell me why did he write about this\nWas ... promoted motivating to as you said that um as when asked battlefields pie extending off that meant comes to build rides a company that coffee cake to places where millions died gets kind of battlefield\nKind of meat packing all the cliches of the press that already supported the war and also conveniently forgetting all kinds of mystifying all the horror and atrocities the suffering that happened in that place\nAnd all that I'm kind of as a tourist package for money cause of lady dislike tourism in itself but in this context it was especially horrifying for him in his text and by the way he mostly chest sites the ads and uh it was also a text he'd like to read a lot\nWell let's hear grounds himself reading from his own school about trips to hell and you don't need to speak German to head the band he suppressed rage in his voice cedar\nFair for me

think that that is of subjects the other day was wearing one of these uneven headlines and I'm like if that isn't hedging your bets I don't know what that is I Want it both ways I think we're going to
