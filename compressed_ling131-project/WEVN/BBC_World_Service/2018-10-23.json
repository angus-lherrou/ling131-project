R. T. V. and that in addition to what we call multi drug resistant tuberculosis it's one of the top five countries in the world and so they had a difficult time in treating patients\nUsing the capital and they were able to find that really is very very difficult patients\nThat they were able to actually have an extremely good success rate of Ninety three percent is one of the two new drugs that we have for tuberculosis in the last fifty years so uh this is a ... he's a big breakthrough\nBut it points out the need for more\nKinds of drugs like this and it's important because with tuberculosis you cannot treat with just one drug\nYou must have at least to effective drugs so just in developing one and and just giving that alone is going to cause resistance to that particular drug\n... so it's about the only way to beat tuberculosis is to have one drug and combined with the others who does that mean it was simply a case of mixing a cult fell together in the right way and then eventually you know get bingo you've done it\nRight now since we only have two new drugs that means that you do have to combine them with the drugs that we already know about ... and uh but that's not going to be good enough pretty soon we're going to need additional new medications in order to get to the to the bottom of treating tuberculosis in all its or\nWhy is tuberculosis so from its points of view so successful\nTuberculosis is successful it's it's an organism that can live in your body in a dorm at fashion\nMaybe never even develop if your immune system is healthy you may never even actually develop the actual disease all just like dormant in your body\nAnd some ... and then other times if your immune system is weak\nFor example when you had HIV when you have diabetes and other conditions that where your immune system goes down certain cancers the kidney disease that can actually make the organism come alive again to actually develop to actually develop the D. disease of tuberculosis\nAnd tuberculosis is spreading to the rich countries is correct\nI think that the tuberculosis as a disease of low and middle income countries in countries like the United states to the the numbers and the rates are very low but there is something very interesting that's going on in especially the middle income countries like South Africa\nChina India needed the countries that have some of the highest burdens of tuberculosis there now middle income countries they're rich countries are becoming richer and with that becomes better nutrition and in some cases a lot of obesity why is that important because obesity is linked to diabetes and diabetes is linked to the curriculum is\nBecause if you have diabetes your risk of coming down with tuberculosis is three times higher\nSo that we can have the thing but it's like putting fire on something where you're tuberculosis is common and now you're going to have diabetes adding fuel to that fire and I can see a a growth of the tuberculosis in some of these especially middle income countries the quarter the world's faith in it is in India\nOkay and then if there is the obesity is going up there then you have the ... the people who have a dormant in their bodies growing in a place like the United states where the where the background a level of tuberculosis very low even when you when you have obesity\nYou're not in diabetes in term it's not you're not going to see the effects as much\nFor ... for countries like India South Africa China the ... so you will be to fights obesity would die and we'd lifestyle I'm through that way you can be tuberculosis\nAnd that's one of the ways that you were able to beat tuberculosis long you know ultimately what you need for tuberculosis it to make sure that people are treated appropriately with the right a combination of drugs\n[noise] took to pull the food you are there from the international union against tuberculosis and lung disease telling us about discovery by scientists but to Ninety percent of patients who heads a form of a drug resistant tuberculosis and not to send to them recovered very significant indeed\nFour years ago a bunch of friends come up with the deal should you know future film impoverished bad no money no ... of annoyed do ... food end up ...

percent of protected areas with lions are underfunded it's a pretty dire situation we found that these parks require\nBetween one to two billion dollars annually in order to adequately protect lands

pressures on protected areas become worse but it's not all bad news because it's only one point two billion dollars I mean relatively\nUs twice as much on the management of its national park system or you know that might be equivalent to a purchasing a U.S football team like the Detroit Lions so for a relatively small cost we really can't save lions and their ecosystems\nAnd secure the backbone of Africa's parks\nIn the report you make the link a but if there isn't a major increase in funding there will be a decline in the population of loans that were you for your social norms why what's the link\nThough because lions are the top predator in the ecosystem\nAnd so their survival is linked to the entire food Web all the traffic levels below them so they're basically a proxy for the overall health of the ecosystem and we know that strong resilient ecosystems benefit people directly through ecosystem benefits like clean water\nHealthy soils and so saving protected areas saving wildlife is actually saving people it's an investment in people as well\nBut more some would be to this on the from doing small pox is long term problem and yet the lines were still look\nYes that's a good point um lions are very resilient species generally about where now at a tipping point for their species so\nUnless we act now there are species will continue to decline and so that's why we feel like the timing of this study is particularly useful because we are at that tipping point the actions we take now will determine the future of the lions and they're larger ecosystems\nWhat constitutes a tipping point now as opposed to five years ago ten years ago\nWell lines have decreased about forty percent in the last few decades and so we're really at that at that point where you know their populations have declined to the point where ecologically speaking they're just gonna keep heading south when a species reaches a certain point in their populations there is really just no turning back\nSo we feel like we're at the point now where there are still enough independent populations that are resilient enough and strong enough and there's enough protected areas which is what we focus

alive then said he had died in a fistfight\nAnd now says he was killed by rogue agents I spoke earlier to the BBC's mark ... at low and I began by asking whether Mr Edwards decision to have his speech today translated smoking is Lee in Arabic and English was a comment one\nIt's not unusual I think it's a sign China that President said on clearly wants to direct the speech um at President Trump at the White House um to put pressure on Washington to\nTo harden its tone to one ... on top of his mind toward Saudi Arabia and also of course to\nAh the Saudi kingdom as well uh to to put the pressure on the Saudis to come clean on what took you believed was premeditated murder state sanctioned matter of ... clearly frustration uh in the cycle of power in ... that the Saudis have changed from ...

government believes that this was a planned merger savagely panned as ... as his government says\nAnd we expect a much more incriminating material than the Saudis have or I'd have admitted to in the

have very different definitions of the truth plus of course as you say the changing Saudi story\n[noise] yeah and and I think when you talk about those two different competing narratives of to play as

commentators have described him as an enemy of turkey and I think what President on woman's really is um action taken to try to sideline the crown prince\nThe problem for turkey is that so far it seems that MBA is going nowhere and in fact the kings on Mount of Saudi Arabia simply announced in the last few days but that would be a restructuring of the Saudi intelligence agency and that would be put under the aegis of guess who haven't learned prince Mohammed bin\nSalman Dina hospital the CIA us CIA director is heading at your weight she's heading to Istanbul how is that going to affect
