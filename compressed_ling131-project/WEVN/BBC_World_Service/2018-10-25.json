would also come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these terms men's spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it\nAnd as we do provoked very strong feminist an anti feminist responses and some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on a social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic you mentioned that cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked [noise]\nThat would count myself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's Dr molten Bayh he's a research fellow at the center for deep still future at the University of Southern California but more importantly\nHe's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the un yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good and balance\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some sounds to key issue with the casting choices you seat never before I had a star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and this got some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten got curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Ryan jumps and\nSome of them except the behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nThere were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it\nSeems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been around for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls I've been sort of themselves and American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of\nSituations at the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election and so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they ...\nWhether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer tactic that's the kind of idea just a generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society it's like the star wars example whatever people's thoughts would about the constant choices that would always be some people who would agree and something who disagree\nBut if ... our rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating these spaces and sending up the volume as each of those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggles to take action\nAs Yoda says anger leads to hate hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already look which skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority\nView that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of\nConversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe continent is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvy do get picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nIt's only bound to increase the divisions in societies that are well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that ... conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias then divvied year will only concerned is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of this senseless political correctness brigade inaction [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program can we conclusively say that ... video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ... campaign against this information suggesting\nIf you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one\nBut what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode suddenly fits into a broader path\nOne very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's disinformation campaigns\nBut at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and is video which raises a valid point I suppose is an active propaganda\nWell I'm going to let John Walsh the Russian troll hunter we spoke to earlier on um sometimes\nMy real in goal here is to get people to be a little more conscious about what they decide to share on line and get people to maybe understand the sharing this piece of what looks to be\nOn verified information or this viral retreating this very viral tweet that confirms your political bias might not always be the greatest thing and to just take like a couple of minutes and look at what you're getting ready to do before you do it\nSo as we've said before think twice\n\n... silver reporting with my ...\nComing up after the break which countries there at the top of the

and some of those in leading countries have\nRecognized that climate change is a major potential source of economic and financial instability Ifill battered by storms and hurricanes that the economic instead of the the on a major scale\nAnd we're seeing these very dramatic effects of storms and hurricanes causing major economic damage in different parts of the will\nAnd will have actually seen so

London School of hygiene and tropical medicine discovered Ebola and it's a leading global experts on pendant mix I asked him about the risks they pose\nTo condemn it could trigger a global recession it all depends how big it is of course and where it's will hit\nAnd we know that the Spanish flu a hundred years ago I'm reduced global GDP by about five percent three trillion in these days we know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of SARS really hit the GDP by about closest three percent\nBut it was also an increase by to hundreds base point in the country risk premium so that's another problem so according to the size of the epidemic we're talking about the damage in terms of trillions note in billions\n[noise]\nThe failure to think beyond finance is the first lesson that has yet to be loans the second is that management and regulations focused on what was happening within individual countries are the bankers were operating system which transcended national borders\n\nIn the u._k. before separation of investments in retail banks has addressed the number one on all the sources of risk so John Vickers a colleague Iraq's would university shed the independent commission banking sets up by the u._k. government following the crisis\nI asked him whether this has made banking safe for\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions doing ordinary high street banking which we all depend on smoking\nAll full of global investment banking and they got into trouble on on all those friends then the second heading was\nHow to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses if we're more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cooled ring fencing so this is the idea\nThe ordering high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped it was cool things which we all of us individuals and small businesses depends on which the government can't let fall over without title calamity\nThat those activities in major banks should be in a so standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposure to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds\nThat you wouldn't imperil domestic banking from a global crisis and if nonetheless there is some jeopardy so that it puts you in a much better position to do with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the adoption of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become concentrated in fewer homes in the u._k. is in the U.S taxpayers' money was used to bailout failing banks and to sweets in terms of a merger with bigger banks\nThe result was that the surviving banks go even bigger in competition was reduced the big banks are not too big to fail I mean if they collapsed that would bring down the whole system\nList implies the government's which means the taxpayers have given them an implicit guarantee of survival here's another ... co author of the bankers' new clothes\nThe size of the largest banks certainly group\nThat will tell you that they did the favor of swallowing the weaker institution but there's really nothing natural or nothing efficient about the size and complexity of these institutions if they lived in market they couldn't actually live like that at all not one day it just that they have a privileged existence what they keep getting funding despite being\nSold risky insult pay their too many privileges of too many subsidies that's coming on with the status\nOf being sort of that big and dominant and so all the counter parties want to deal with you because they know you can't default on your loan\nI asked her with a measures to prevent the next financial crisis and improve matches well made them was\nI think that he has made things worse and even though it may have been their first response you know quick solution it really ended up with a system ten years later that's pretty scary and distorts the economy about competition and about and just about anything\nFor growing complexity into dependency of the banking system was facilitated by revolutionary technological changes such as growing computer power which allowed physics and math graduates to build financial products\nWhich the top bosses let alone the regulators politicians and customers do not understand fall from reducing and offsetting risk innovations we're raising and spreading it\nI think we were told that all these innovations and that word you know used around Silicon Valley where I Am a lot innovation\nWas kind of a great thing that it would allow you know more efficient funding it would spread the risk ever more efficiently around the world and instead it was really a lot of financial innovation is really about\nClever ways to hide the risks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not necessarily useful for society so yeah at some level you you want it functioning financial system and the financial system can do wonderful things\nBut out of control it it's really dangerous and I think that a lot of energy was spent in justifying things that are not that great and in a void being discussion\nTimes in which the public was deceived do miss sold and older misconduct that goes on in this industry\nAs the pace of technological change has accelerated this concern has become more acute and increasingly\nKnown financial institutions such as ... companies mobile phone operators and others issue in

electric capital which trades digital currencies\nHe told me that it's no accident that corner rose immediately after the financial crisis as it's aimed to build a financial system without relying on will being supervised by the discredited government authorities\nBecause it was launched into his name and it was very much catalyzed by the failure of the financial system fundamentally the words intermediary trust\nTrust lesson is these are the terms ISI recurring and and the original decline my paper and it's because fundamentally what happened in two thousand eight\nAs we realized that the system was predicated on trusting these very large and powerful intermediaries and one of the intermediaries fail the entire system fails with it that collapsed indicated not only that the system itself had some critical designs laws\nThat got I think about going in terms of thinking about what a system might look like they did not have those fairly\nRecent years have shown that bitcoin and other digital currencies letter on not issued by central banks\nSuffer from many of the same failings as other currencies in fact they've been subject to even more volatility and fraud bitcoin advocates and other new technology firms typically like to convince us that the new technologies or force for good\nBut the financial crisis highlighted the extent to which technology can be both a friend and the photo\nTechnological change can bring great benefits but it also can be a source of mayhem which amplifies risk the same technologies\nWhich allow me to communicate this program with listeners around the world and for you to disseminate through social media could be used for example by people on Facebook to spread fake news\nThe crisis arose because decision makers were blinded by blizzard of information finance\nIs highly dates are intensive industry order to credit rating agencies banks and regulators reduced everything to numbers [noise]\nAs the volume of Trump's actions
