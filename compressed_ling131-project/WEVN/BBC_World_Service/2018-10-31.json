example it's a real person\n... is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation a think tank in Washington DC and he was a member of the president's commission\nAnother example of the problem is is there is a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that\nCitizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not check that's a problem and is the problem that in many states you don't have to show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place\nAnd give them a name and you get to vote\nAnd you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are stirring up a specter for problem where there wasn't really a problem\nHow'd you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of the law back in two thousand eight what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nClose election I don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election where the margin of victory as tens of millions of votes\nIt would take an awful lot of fraud and change that and us probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful of votes\n... taking the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of focus oppression and what your political opponents say is that the kind of measures that you're talking about fixing to unfortunate packing the focus oppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient a scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes in fact it's a bit patronizing I think frankly borders on racist\nTo believe that for example African Americans don't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nThat many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose curious the problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with old most surgical precision\nI offer tons if he could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who are suing said was this is going to a depressed turn out\nThe number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nHow long have you back on Monday is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the ballot the molten fight the voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud I think it's a very small\nProblem and one that has been exaggerated I think that you see cases here are cases there there might be a county ... county there where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur\nAnd so I think there has been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and had made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nThat if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out truly need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there are\nTargeting solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution a lot more people have been prevented from voting and fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocks from the balls than voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually\nFraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem\nIs that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to orange swayed from participating because the barriers that have been erected ... to the ballot box whatever didn't see how they actually do I think there's been a lot of studies there's been numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduce voter turnout and at a reduced voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by academic\nHave been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas and Tennessee I think if you look at the intent of Republicans have claimed many different occasions that these laws have helped them politically than helping carry key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and\nI think it also just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access\nTo the process that your people that are going to participate\nBut also the last election in North Carolina the state board of elections did a careful review and they found ... five hundred cases of people voting you shouldn't have isn't that evidence of vote to froze I almost Ari\nIf you look at the case the frog they weren't covered\nMost of the time they were ex felons\nWho didn't realize they were ineligible to know there are people going to an already served their time and they were on probation or parole and they thought they were eligible to vote when they cast a ballot because there was a very very steep price to pay I mean you're talking about potentially a facing ... years in jail a steep fines\nAll for one vote and most people would not do that if they knew what the penalties would be [noise]\nMost of the ...

extremists\nEarlier grieving parents gathered at the tree of life synagogue for the first funerals victims of the mass shooting not an understatement to say President Trump's visit to Pittsburgh has been divisive Julian Rose the political reporter for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette explained to me earlier\nFirst started whenever the president had said that in his Fox News interview that um he was

executive rich Fitzgerald declined him and they all either you know said that it was a scheduling matter or because\nLeaders need to respect the families and the community's wishes so I think that's

I take care of sick babies that are in the ICU um after they are born to them you know I think you [noise]\n\nNewborn babies are not born addicted that is that common misnomer\nBut addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple facets to it so babies are not born addicted they're not drug babies\nThere incidents that were exposed to a substance in utero\nThat exposure for long enough lead to a dependency and because they became dependent on that substance once airborne and they no longer have that substance being provided they become at risk of going through withdrawal and what sorts of um withdrawal symptoms to debate\nSo babies have the same withdrawal symptoms as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI systems so vomiting diarrhea\nExcessive volume off they have respiratory symptoms so they read fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kidney a which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot\nBut the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their wellbeing so babies are in console of all and crying that is babies don't handle that\nYou and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for hours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick babies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but these little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crying\nThey sleep substantially less than that and in the absence of sleep or any of us will get sick but babies that happens within hours today's instead of weeks\nAnd what kind of trend have you seen 'em in the last few years um has it gone down up stay the same\nCertainly increasing I mean we know that nationally we know the numbers are significantly increase anyway we've had a seven hundred percent increase in substance affected infant and the past decade\nIn Kentucky or nationally nationally and at the trends in Kentucky are probably leading that fact\n\nUm she's one we go today

I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time when the birth rate in the states with about seven\nPer woman it was an extraordinarily\nProlific birth rate compared to today and that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of population change in the United states in that era if you look at later eras this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled\nWorkers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy then the situation is quite different and it creates a new class stratification\nThat entail new social\nThat we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ... son on editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S. curbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of a classic American narrative that is at the Pentagon is immigrant who arrives to seek a new life on through hard work determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states is often described as homes the largest immigrant population in the world\nIt's a question I put to a chump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of immigration and how immigrants who've been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship\nAnd in the grants were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship\nAnd there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here who did the manual labor the agricultural labor\nBut they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we see this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and it's connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens\nAnd people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship now after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship citizenship by birth is created and this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized\nThe purpose of them is to prevent or because of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's a dream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries\nHave applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen ... early twentieth century of large European immigration where this suppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states as a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who are coming into the country today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority\nOf immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor low educational levels\nRole in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there is not upward mobility for them\nAs a dean at here is an American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as as for European no there have even more recent non that doesn't mean that there has never been Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who\nHave succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it that historically those populations have been permanently marginal\nClear that your own a different and the political spectrum to ... the editor of the national review who had from the other what'd you make of his argument that in order to safeguard democracy in America at the moment to allow the current population to adapt to change your calling me what's needed\nIs a cook on immigration because what is happening is that the economy in America is\nChanging to one that's founded on knowledge on stem subjects rather than a Monday factory\nWell that Dan knowledge economy requires a huge service economy to service it who is cleaning the house is taking care of the children making the food growing the food for the wealthy people in the service economy it's poor people of color who are providing those services\nProfessor of either Chomsky at Salem State University and the case you're wondering yes she is the director of the famous American ... no ...\nOne of the American dream is proving elusive to many so is the European one I leave the last word to late in the modern migrant in Spain in conversation with the BBC Simon grief\nFor the dream\nMiss when you're on\nThe dream come true though for him to the ... when you're looking in\nThe middle of all I mean why costs have become a reality\nNow one of us and I love it I go\nLike into the pop out when I
