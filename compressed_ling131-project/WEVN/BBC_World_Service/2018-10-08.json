explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models was suggesting we were heading for something of a coma\nLet me issue me a ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... raised with ... wins the Atlantic clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most precipitation overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've had from friday also which is as a great marketing who'd over this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving ... the amount the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur\nOur approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one\nAnd we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics or intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously warm Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... and you could ... Pacific Ocean\nBasically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern is in uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast industrialization so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change\nA large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point a degree Celsius\nAs well as changes that there had on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and believe it particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform\nA changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that the climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese patents have geographical variation can lead us look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael mind\nParticularly in the like the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a wall still fall out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius\nSo there's a very large region in the Atlantic the sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to foreign those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that is right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier\nWere seen storms turned into major hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic look potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting sauce to most summers and recovering more poorly each winter Julian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seeing kind of self the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOf the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up and I can't and also thick enough to support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were trying to deploy ... and you know we couldn't find many flags that were very thick so we're putting out these beliefs and ice that may be a meter thick and you're hoping that it was still survive and locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through that twenty sending me just a note since we had to plant\nEighty eight point three W.

important to get into detail how difficult it will is\nBecause there's so few people will ever become a member and for the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely slam thoughts

him from that now good morning Jeremy good morning\nCould this be the eurozone's next sulfur in debt crisis\nI think it may well be in the last few weeks had been hopes here in Brussels particularly within the European Commission that Italy's government would be persuaded to back down on some of its spending proposals and tax cuts at that time I haven't been the case in the sense here is that\nThere are people that the commission can talk to in room for people like for example Giovanni three of the finance minister but then the people pulling the strings and those pulling the strings

... ... ... a few weeks ago Mr solving immediately blamed Europe for that Europe's failure to invest in China and destruction\nAnd I think that's the conclusion that people here who come to the the the Italian government particularly insofar as it's driven by Mr solving is determined to take on Europe will be seems to take on Europe and that means a major bust up over this budget\nBut do you

Italy's debt this is not a government living in the realm of of economic reality I'm afraid and\nUm it doesn't seem like government you know especially listening joins us now is leaving itself much room to back down there for this ... added to that you have to include the but the fact that there is now this competition within the government between the Laker now the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself is a dominant force and so\nI I can see this becoming a sort of competition between the two a governing coalition partners in ... as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take 'em Brussels more\nUh you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism was one phrase used um and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of um of of of the major showdown in which the Italian government actually embraces um penalties imposed from Brussels over its budget deficit\nHas kinda macho politics isn't it absolutely does does cloud ... of the nation how we could have a point I mean France and Germany they've gotten away with overspending and and you know exceeding their public debt limit sets out buddy you why can't it and he just do the same it is one rule for them in one rule fits in isn't it\nIt's not to turkey and reasonable point and I think the the the with some of the commission particularly miss miss the most ... a commissioner responsible for economic and financial if as who were willing to give it to leave them into bits of breathing room on this they felt that if they could be escalate the conflict they they would actually denied the Italian government the chance to\nSee ... this is disagreements with Brussels\nBut I I think the difference as opposed to what people here in Brussels or in in the commission would say is that when Germany and France over steps that a budget rules they will lead by governments that seemed at least to understand the importance of those rules are more willing to die that country's back home to a sensible path\nAnd then they look for example the Italian governments budget proposals and the wildly unrealistic growth expectations in those and say this is not a government we can do business with in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German governments at the time when they overstepped the debt deficit of it but\nThe European Union can't afford to bailout is later this is this is the ultimately the big problem for actually\nIt's too big to fail exactly and and I think this this also interact with of course the the ongoing debates about reforming the euro zone where the the commission is treading a very fine line on the one hand you have\nA countries like Italy like but also other other countries in southern Europe or who's the violence is a week or a new field there is no ... years and who have been pushing for greater burden sharing within two years and and on the other hand you have moved and European states or one of them is Germany but even more hard line on this is the so called new ... leaks of this new gang of\nA ... a Scandinavian states led by the Dutch who who are very skeptical about any further risk sharing within the years and and that's all going to come to a crunch in mid December to summit here in Brussels and that may well now take place against the backdrop of escalating a sort of tit for tat between Rome in Brussels which of course we'll make compromise at the summit very difficult indeed\nJeremy cliff the economists columnist and correspondent in Brussels thanks very much for that", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "08"}
