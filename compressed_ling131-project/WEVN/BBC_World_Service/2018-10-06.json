believe\nThat although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention what a\nVarious political parties have done the wreck or several years transforming that the um transportation secretary that we have here in in our way and\nWe have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of Kent Goodman since\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars where electrical and that's a ... a a major leaked towards a more green society\nEspecially when we know that the transport sector is a big country it ... into the CEO to\nCredits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us the money to do all the research on how old is a green technology development\nGave some days that I think that because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact do make the climate better globally\nAnd would you be job abroad or we do a better job inside nowhere and doctors because we have demoted for more than go to to do the job we do a lot of things in the rain forest ... we do look with the electrical cars you know where there's a good thing\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him carry this\nBecause he is not to view that shared by much the Norwegian public that actually better that no way does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out cleaning from the ground and where the good guys and all of this\nI think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing fulfills funeral in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you\nCan sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for it and places like the parents see in the ...\nI Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate guessing mission\nCan Goodman says well I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on coal in the work\nBut it or not oil we're talking about oh yeah but\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants for example gas\nOr even oil they will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener refers tests to start stopping the coal plants and\nWhen we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough so we have to be\nStriving toward agreement society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually it's yeah ...\n... Christ offices in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long a counter and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on the ... when I was next incident and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students at when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get a false that feels good sunny stuff\nWould look at the time frame\n... could at least but says well it could be dragging on two twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency does a still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is\nBased if we go to do a big big job ... to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge drove ... on on how do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that he lied to know is small and and we've been debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built how fast new investments are being made into\nRenewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas and oil in competition with the whole as a politician\nAnd in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell these ideas how on us as anybody else going to buy and\nWell it's difficult in Norway that it's become easier I've been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become each year but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and it's been I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince was kind of\nTo look on what are our options what are the renewables for example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our place to make their more renewable but where do you get to do so well uh you get to perhaps\nAnd it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making some of our lands part of the ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called a clean uno they changed their name it's part of that strategy because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more\nGreen gay or at the same time we have to address CCS as his view because carbon capture and storage on carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... one of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like no the the wages they stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere is a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we are\nKind of you wants to connect with CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually agree on is let me just explain what we mean by that cash a story\nAnd it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take become for the environment and and put it away the underground all under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now and I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't no way are shifting government system quiet all of a lot of money to trying to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and his staff has been focused on in Norway for Twenty years I think also I needed to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do less and they what you think the

country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is ... ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and ships because we're a shift nation and I was so\nVery because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating in the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewable not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an Arctic oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen than it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export

can help you on line at or dash Reno dot com\nAnd yeah we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can't government's fault\nNo no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to drive to shift to hide the green shift to even do if we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the American sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made it out there I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening in other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds\nOf ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument is that you will see now that you and you will and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by\nProducing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new reached gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\nAnd does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city\nThere is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas it's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the ... comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than old not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies playing some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to lease powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn there and see they have drilled about twice as much if Russia and we have sort of this expression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the air and sea\nAnd I don't think it's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat that is according to the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally seeds to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe\nCold leaf because of what you mean by that call them price the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nOn the market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices are starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough pushups renewables\nStale and would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing in Germany they are afraid somebody called the corporate pricing no but also the way the energy system works and seems to nibble energy is so much more cost efficient\nWhen it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway count we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an expert of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're going to keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but\nBut this is about what kind of view do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have\nSierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way relatively poor country Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people ... the the way which treats citizens of the fact that he gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on [noise]\nIf it was

came\n... made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping\nSo we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas remember your along the coast in Europe or the

I mean you you use the word embarrassed ... when you look at the main figures in the ... and when you look at president ... for example you just look very embarrassed\n[laughter] yeah well that's obviously not very surprising right like you know whether it was your behind\nThe scenes that may be people looking at a red faced\nI'm sure they didn't receive Venus I was happy faces I'm sure that was like something that caused a you know international backing especially that you are you know when you're trying to show off your and your skills and then you get called in and some of that\nAs a temp that's not really a great day for you [noise]\nAh but that's also like you know like the the Russian or an additive old ways you know whenever they're called I never there's an accusation as old as denial it's always like you know are they walk or the or the investigations they always say there's no blues over you see although we did see you know the force by taking pictures and all of these things\nSo that's that's not really surprising thing\nFor when I'm not just as soon as I said I Do find it I'm finished that it it it is creeping into our everyday lives of other things that you think we could practically due to to to to push back not necessarily finding things but within how we live our lives that a lot of pushback against the sense\nI think that's a very good question I and I think you know a one of the things that we could do as citizens and our daily life it's practice something called digits and hygiene\nSo very small things such as like you know a a changing your passwords often backing up your data being a little bit kind of like vigilant and care for how you deal with your uh online life like the same way though you did with you know for example the safety of your house right he wouldn't leave your door open\nAnd I expect that you know you are safe so kind of like back this nice minimal things\nThat would I mean there has been some studies saying that if like people collectively like you know kind of ended up getting back to this um a dish that hygiene you could limit up to eighty percent of the ... crimes and then the focus would be on the more complex the geopolitical level is that the choir like the sophisticated level of sophistication\nAnd almost geopolitical level do you see any sort of any move towards some sort of regulation of cyberspace\nYes well a that's a very good point I think you know what happened yesterday you should be put in the context of what's going on at the international level so late to this this month Russia is planning on submitting to drop through the motions to the U.N General assembly\nA one on basically imposing codes of conduct for house they should behave with a guy you know each other into cyberspace but also one or two I suggest thing and you cybercrime convention due to place one that has been a and demanded by the concept of Europe so obviously there's a lot going on on\nYet you what happened yesterday and I think is that with the Russian activity and like you know they wanted to separate the but also they want to come to the negotiating table from the position of power\nAnd that has actually been said by as senior advisor to president but then saying that the upper paying something and the information every now that would lead them speak to the Americans as equals safeguard that on on on one hand and also the western states obviously they're trying to push back against this attitude is just so they wanted to kind of\nShow what the Russians are really doing and then try and get the countries that are not you know Russia or China or like with the states that are in the middle of the art form the undecided the kind of like you know was there so I thought you could easily argue that\nBoy thank you very much for coming in and led to his act May of Chatham House you're listening to the b._b._c.

[noise] well\nThey a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the ... to hashtags so\nThere are definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when when the me too\nI'm really aggressively one activists came up with the idea of using him oh jeez I'm for that character as it sounds like me too in Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie emerging me\nToo [laughter] I should get around and add it worked for a while but then the ... but then it'll get right Patricia\nI'm I just wondered whether this movement in the given some ended by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese found this change so much with this or the one child policy on that because there were probably a few a woman but in more than ... than the than there might have been a generation of but whether this played into its at all\n[noise] well I think it may it it's really hard to tell it at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThan she doesn't have to compete with a brother for parental investment and so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers\nWhy do you think we all ... apparently so troubled by this I mean when you look at ... news to ideology that doesn't necessarily say to you that you should be what region of the women campaigning for equality or does it\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen provide such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written into the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd in the early communist era of course one of ... the domes famous sayings is that women hold up half the sky so that was what the Chinese people were taught\nAnd ... for several decades in the in the fifties sixties and seventies um and women were assigned jobs and they were a there was a lot more a gender parity in terms of pay well everybody was poor but but there wasn't just a huge\nAnd growing gender gap which really began with the onset of market reforms in China\nUm but but we're we're the onset of market reforms it means that the gender discrimination against women has has grown exponentially and that's one of the grievances that the main grievance of these young feminists\nThank you very much for coming on a letter home ... just taught me to say thank you very much to Patricia ... view company this morning and thank you for listening to this tradition of weekend back at the same time tomorrow religious international news is next here on the BBC ...

analyzing the data is with me\nNow we jak these he seems to be spending so much time on his own but I was interested to see that in the study not everyone thinks that loneliness is about being on your end today\nNo no uh we had a sort of participants believing that line and this is about being on your own but all the rest associated with very different things\nAnd I was surprised to see the full ... percent of the people who responded told us they think that learning is can sometimes be positive that seem surprising when it's such an unpleasant feeling\nHas so much is a little bit like a social first let's say so when you're very very thirsty it's not pleasant of course but it's there for a reason is there to tell you you need to drink your body is is aching for that drink\n'em and you do it and it's gone I'm learning is is a little bit like that in the sense that yes it is painful and it has to be painful so that you pay attention to what's happening and what's lacking\nBut as long as you respond to it by re directing your attention to others and to your social connections it should go away and it should be fine um so it's not necessarily negative and in fact it can sometimes be positive because it it leads to an anticipation of social connection for example\nBut of course where it goes wrong is where either you don't pay attention to those signs or you can't because for example like jak as we heard just now you you have no ... no sufficient mobility no sufficient resources to actually be able to connect to others\nNow this was a global study and people from all over the well chose to take part did you find that people everywhere experience learning as\nWell the short answer is yes we did find on innocent every country and in every age group all over

there was a bigger reduction in in ... uh across the lifespan than in others but at the trend is always they\nAre but we also found that culture can make a difference\nNow there were nine countries

around and come to potatoes or cheese was not then you become much more on level\nThe ideal situation as an individual and it was a company we believe in free trade and let's let the consumer decide what's right\nBut terrorists do the opposite of that consumers have no choice but to pay more or do without terrorists on taxes the force up prices\nPresident Trump has been promising his strategy might mean short term pain but in ... long term game but it will bring jobs and prosperity back to the United states\nWould fit the south in Wisconsin's biggest city Milwaukee the opposite has happened with a symbolic blow the famous motorcycle manufacture a Harley Davidson announced that in response to retaliate tree terrorists from Europe it would move some production abroad\nHonestly Wilson is a trade specialist with the New York times\nThe past ... the people who own and Dr Harley Davidson our van ...\nPointed that out frequently I think that's one of the reasons that Harley Davidson decision to offshore some of its production because of the task became such a political kind of talking point for the president and fat that others in the United states\nThey are being hit by a terrorist from Europe and so they've decided to\nMove that portion of bike production that would go to the European market offshore they said that by manufacturing nice forty thousand motorcycles in the United states that would be headed for Europe they would face\nPotentially thirty to forty five million dollars in tax penalties and that was the price they just weren't willing to pay\nPresident
