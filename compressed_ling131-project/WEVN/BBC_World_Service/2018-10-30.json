on information being passed on from Mexican authorities or non profit organization and so there is a an information like going on\nIs a rule so perhaps a willingness to proceed water\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's definitely at this point I think the deployment what it really it deter people they are have very difficult\nConditions as it is walking I'm starting three three or four I Am to avoid the worst of the heat so I think at this point they're very determined to continue and they're well aware that Trump pet as a spoken harsh say against them and their continuing anyways\nAnd we keep asking ourselves that question why are more citizens voting for the far right or the far left across the world but we should really be asking ourselves is why aren't they voting for the center\nFor those voters are coming from somewhere and that means the center parties both centralized an center right out bruising to the fringes and said well we're seeing is this sort of hourglass shape emerge in many not just western countries countries around the world where the fringes that gaining and the center of looks thinner and thinner\nThose very interesting just told me a little bit about who makes up the center will support for a little bit to\nWhat we've seen especially in places like Germany's at these center left or center right parties that become indistinguishable from each other in many ways and they haven't set\nA vision for the future that can really grab people's imagination and what we're seeing now is the voter more and more wanting okay clear vision whether they be anti immigrant invasions about heart\nBorders and security or are they more or less decision about social welfare writes a minority rights and things like that\nSo do you sense that just the luck of ideological clown routine or is it more like I mean ability to articulate what these time full\nI think I think it's both but what we're seeing is that ah these party basically I had been advocating for the same agenda for decades they become technocrats or the Social Democrats have basically been advocating for the same things in the Nineteen sixties\nAt this point these parties look more and more like parties of the old regime young people have no memory of the Nineteen sixties and\nThey sound like a hundred and Ninety nineties for that matter so we talk about the centrist values liberal democratic values a lot of younger people don't have any connection that any more of\nAn interesting point that you make a lot to do so it's a little bit and go to Africa for example ... come from for example where the president has been in place since Nineteen eighty six\nWho keeps trying to explain the Ugandans by the way of some of the youngest in the world what happened in Nineteen Ninety six when the two of them and\nAnd a lot of young people especially the social media say what are you talking about how to pump to lead roles reinvent themselves to mix with the ...\nThe mainstream politicians these days the dinosaur [laughter] um I think ah to people who grew up in the digital revolution or people who don't know a life before I really Facebook Twitter and iPhones um and so when you have people their seventies representing them that doesn't feel genuine to them anymore and I think\nAnd especially at the center left I mean I think the biggest\nA story here that we're seeing in recent elections across the world\nIs not so much about the rise of the right but said that's profound collapse of the central laugh that's left is opportunity for more of these fringe parties to fill in that voter gap and so I think they have to think about they want to\nYou could say a mobile I support their mojo back if you will present a progressive vision for the future which is was center left party just supposed to do and what we're seeing them doing is presenting it backwards looking vision towards policies that bench of essentially fulfilled\nRemember took your book to Nineteen

think are too dangerous octaves risky\nThe one that's in in a lot of conversation now in terms of writing is the idea of cultural appropriation who's allowed to tell what story and I mentioned that because while I don't have any rules about what I can and can't do as an artist\nI I'm sensitive to watch a few of offensive to me and as a writer living in South Africa who came here in Nineteen Ninety two I Am South African you know I I Am a citizen of this country\nBut I'm a particular kind of citizen and so I find that this or two stories I approach with and I haven't learned how to tell

real risk you know which to having such a history of protests and things are connected to the struggle for freedom on many levels in South Africa and in all kinds of environments most of the

chicken and the government's nurses and in the narratives\nUm may I tend to a wonderful audience handing them out ... and ... you do you think any of you that there ought to be\nHigher than in the ... and I'm a student at the university and I think even those taboos or something that come about as a result of like social consensus\nAnd usually they're there to like ... and then sometimes it's a good thing when we don't feel comfortable joking about it and things like the impact of gender based violence of things like homophobia are so huge\nThat we can't even risk to try to minimize those issues because you give a green light to people who would act out that bigotry in ways that tend to be harmed people\nSo I think that it's necessary for us particularly in disciplines where maybe we're making light to the committee for example but in film navigating the taboo would look at the difference I think people navigate taboos in ways that show where we stand as a society about those
