restrictions or we might see a global Magnitsky a designation stitching in and uh if uh\nThe crown prince a survives the storm she'll see this as the best possible outcome given the constraints\nYou mentioned the Turkish president and the fact that even though he promised a lot of detail and he promised to reveal the truth it was more about optics than it was about a revealing the truth of what had happened\nThis three main points so the first is they want to improve the efficiency ineffectiveness of monitoring system so you've got a hundred and sixty four countries around the world all trading together so difficult to keep an eye on what's happening now right everything's technical now\nAnd that brings us into the second point which is they need to modernize trade rules for the twenty first century so we're talking everything from digital trade to international investment state owned enterprises that's code for China by the way\nUm and the third thing is that they want to safeguard and strengthen the dispute settlements system to right now it's really tedious\nLengthy and inefficient try to resolve disputes between countries\nWhich is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private trade war at the moment that started this summer and it's not great because it floats the WTO rules in which case why should the other one hundred sixty two members of all of them\nOver all these people that are meeting in Canada obviously with trying to in the United states not being invited to the world's two largest economies so how's that going to work\nIt sounds like a disaster and not have them there but at the same time I might be really inefficient to have them there at this early stage so one of the things we could see as a negotiating strategy is that\nThese Thirteen stakeholders are joining Canada for this today ... have ideas come up with some solutions and then present them to the to feeding parties as look this is a nice basis for discussion what do you think what do you like and it really takes something on the disposition and personality\nAnd grits and insurance of the people who are committed to multilateral trade to keep doing that I mean not this diplomacy this state craft and stuff that Canada frankly is very good at right in the European\nTo be very good at it but under US President Donald Trump we've seen him on to renegotiate the north American free trade agreement which he has recently done and he took that right to the wire he's pulled out of the Paris\nOr he didn't want to sign up the United states the Paris climate accord he doesn't like international agreements and he says complaining that the United states spends too much on NATO for instance which isn't true by the way but he likes to say that and to paint the United states has a victim China\nSimilarly also is saying you know we're really happy to be part of the world Trade Organization but we are really against we oppose anything that's got penalize our state owned enterprises because that's a huge part of how they operate one\nOf the main functions of the WTO they have a lot of tunnels and sit there looking at international trade the U.S has actually been withholding appointments to various different tunnels\nWell this is so you've got the United states and the one hand saying that you know\nWe're going to withdraw if the WTO to shape up and then on the other hand making it really difficult for the world Trade Organization to function by blocking the appointment of judges right who who do all of the education so that sounds inconsistent they would say that this is part of the way of forcing the issue\nForcing the negotiation and we saw the former head of the world Trade Organization amending ... let me say say what you like about Donald Trump by\nHim wanting the trade war with China and threatening to withdraw the United states he has done what many people have said needs to be done which is to reform the WTO\nThat was independent research stuff\nAnd he had quite an undertaking their main thanks [noise]\n\nIf you think the last few days you'll be familiar with the caravan of thousands of migrants heading from Central America tools the U.S they reached Mexico now gaining numbers in attracting political controversy as they go\nThe size of the group is growing from around the thousands more than seven thousand according to the United nations estimates President Trump has turned the caravan into a major domestic us political issue to accusing the migrants are being criminals among other things\nFor their part the migrants said many of them are parents with young children seeking a better life away from the violence and the lack of opportunity in their home countries one of those in the cabin is twenty nine year old has a gun is at Clinton yet from Honduras he's been speaking to news day about why he's on the move\n\nI'm twenty nine years old on snow for me it's been three years whether it's a job it's ... it's a sacrifice and sometimes I didn't have money to get tiny foods I'm truly scares or if I'm honest I'm afraid because this journey is not easy for me this is the first time leaving 'em ... fear\nBut one I remember the necessity we have about just forces me to continue\nAnd even if I Would like to go back ... not because of retaliation that the Honduran government has promised us saying that's only one who returns to Honduras risks jail for it up to four years no votes isn't my fear my fear to starving to death that's my fear\nThe only thing I Hope was that Mr Donald Trump opens the doors to us about such\nBecause it's been too much sacrifice to get there an end up with nothing we're not going to steal from we're not going to do anything that would be by God's Grace but he can help us\nThat's a Jose again ms ... ah well I've been talking to Daniel ... a reporter for the political news site in the U.S and I asked him how he saw President Trump would react if he heard who is your story\nI guess I Would say that the president or she makes the case then you can't be allowing millions of people from desperate countries because you enter a border and then you know when is it going up\nHe was elected primarily\nOr in some cases a on a anti immigrant platform in twenty sixteen and so he's carrying out his voters promise to try to stop illegal immigration so\nUh he has said that we should have a heart with immigration policy but he doesn't always carry that out in terms of showing for people who are clearly clean desperate situation\nThat sort of a policy line his rhetoric and so on clearly plays very well to his base with these midterm elections approaching sauce do you think it works with the rest of the country particularly perhaps undecided voters\nI think a lot of moderate voters they don't like when Trump uses false statements to back him self up when he was talking about\nYou know unknown middle Easterners in a way in America where a pluralistic society and so a lot of suburban Americans or moderates they don't want to use this type of you know racially motivated\nFear mongering that is not even true I don't know\nI think it says to his small sliver of his base which is still you know thirty percent of Americans but for Democrats for independence for even moderate Republicans you know whatever Trump says on the caravan or immigration policy in general\nMay or June not approve of they don't want immigration policy to run out of\nThe country by a Steven Miller who is very hard right anti immigrant a senior policy adviser to president President Trump\nIs also included said Democrats caravan tried to pin the blame as they were all the Democrats is this a topic that the Democrats than just simply trying to avoid in the run up to the midterms or conversely I wanted to kind of ... most possibly help them in the sense that it might motivate the base perhaps evening courage\nHispanic voters to come out and vote for them\nThat's a great point I think\nDemocrats they don't want to be talking about this issue because no political party has a great answer to immigration policy you know we've both presidents of\nDemocrats and Republicans they tried to tackle immigration reform and they've been stopped a in various efforts and some Democrats want to be talking about health care and the economy and Trump's character a and investigating the president they don't want to be talking about immigration but\nReally this effort to split the country and to buy trumped in terms of this feeling that this was a democratic caravan when a these types of care if it's been happening for the last couple of decades has\nDaniel Lipman with the political a news sites\nAs a lot of coverage and this uh on the BBC Web sites a beast needs to come I'm including a video made by a correspondent

except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government that is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office or on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become\nPhone calls in turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architecture wasn't there for people to just play ... and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only part of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them in terms of boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or work is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or worse campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawns fats artificial and take points for people to come and volunteer\nAnd help turn out to vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system\nHe's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own if he does when it was suddenly send the big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaigns very differently\nThan anyone else has thought possible and I think the true test of better works legacy will be\nHow different democratic presidential candidates tried to emulate what he's doing won't see spending is thirty eight million plus on\nSo far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not yes the two best spenders right now on digital\nExpenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last cycle\nFederal role because his current he losing cording to the opinion polls by on a percentage point also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising as a symptom of sentiment and Suzie as them do you think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in Texas of all university found\nThat Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls\nKen you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in any traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial\nTo the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it but despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at the moment\nThough\nAre forty [noise]\nRepublicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising\nIt is important to stress that while Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties they were all may end up being fairly even so how might this translates into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump after all under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research of a recent us just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential unplugged is somehow should campaigns be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies and through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you're running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach older voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity\nBut at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work\nIt does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction and so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes but what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long\nAnd so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early and campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of that you're a viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close\nIf it's a fifty fifty race\nAnd you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last you know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to regret regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks for a vote as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they\nMay be absolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things but campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table\nAnd so voters in in competitive districts in states should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next uh in the next ten days\nProfessor of government my friend's separate oil this also talks political appetite\nIt's a much manipulation on line ... by trolls for example my line foreign actors\nMay have influenced this election that could be the subject for another business daily we shall see but regardless both parties according these midterms among the most important of our time it will become an here on BBC will serve is of course but for now\nI'm at ... not an end to this message see tomorrow [noise]", "show_name": "BBC
