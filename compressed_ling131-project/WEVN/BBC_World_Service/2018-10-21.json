that\nIt's that it's on page eight\nIt's eight minutes past seven GMT President Trump as a confirmed that the U.S plans to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia he said Moscow had repeatedly violated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty while America had owner did Russia has denied those US claims\nSo who's right President Trump pulled the Russians Daryl Kimball is the executive director of the arms control association\nThat's a U.S based known parties on overnight station which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\nWhile the United states beginning in two dozen fourteen alleged in I Believe it's correct that Russia tested a ground launch cruise missile beyond the five hundred kilometer range limit allowed by the treaty and began to deploy a small number of these missiles\nProbably somewhere in central Russia off and on efforts through diplomacy to confront Russia about the demand that they return to compliance were unsuccessful but I think the diplomatic options to\nDeal with it so clearly not then exhausted there was only one meeting\n... at the trade balance as much in favor of the u._k. so that translates into about a hundred thousand jobs in the u._k. as a result of trade with Saudi are we prepared to give this up and roasted price rose means\nWell one of the things they love and hate Britain leaving me is that we and our I'm willing to escape or other things that we have high without yeah I mean at somebody like ... to ... mid life crisis naming leaving that reliable\nAnd ... now and getting in finding that as a lays out there and more dangerous friends and I think I Am willing to ... come ...\nAll over the leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean it to the the ultimate question is how much does Britain or any other country want to be the policemen of the world is this a wrong or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church is a different set of values than we in the west operate\nOn what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from to keep 'em if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things\nWill murder is always gruesome regardless of how he takes face um and I think uh the the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping and dripping information and then saying don't don't take this into account that's authorized leaks\nSo important to look at a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered and he was um as as Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials\nAnd and and I think we just have to wait for the results of the investigation budge Saudis and how's the world would react to it\nAnd of course even though that when we Neal happening in Yemen and they will still getting very happily and what what what do you think about that\nWell I mean that the crisis is is is another one you've got it it's it's not only Saudi that's operating there it's Iran with who says\nIf the straits of of um of my rape in the south is Red Sea are closed at Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through the straits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us\nAll goes through there it's it's ... ... email you could argue that Saudis actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south\nOften to the west who would be having to pay the price for it one of the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is that sort of you know for a job and complex geopolitical settlement in the middle east what would happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime\nWhat I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of false us and we're still dealing with that I think it'd be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's still early Sunni extremists who wouldn't exploit this but the extremist and done and you you have and then you've got the oil and um we have severe political and economic repercussions that will take many many years even longer than the Iraq War repercussions from steel which will still dealing with no\nThank you very much into becoming martyrs or then Julie somebody as we look ahead to that event in
