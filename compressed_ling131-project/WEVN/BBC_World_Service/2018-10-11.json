McDermott data and investigations reporter and H. P. R. we're partnering with the work place to celebrate this year's class of New Hampshire's rising stars will be the courier museum\nScenarios that are getting closer to was that will wipe out the access to space capability because things will get raise or don't want you to turn to that the major problem with space debris is that everything put up in space is legally owned by somebody\nAnd therefore every screw up there is owned by somebody that you have to get her legal release rubble before you touching so that has to be worked for my assume it will be okay there's what what do you do\nThat and I call it costs like beach coping that so what what you do is you go up there with a electromagnetic center\nWhich you energize either with our nuclear battery or so or\nYou can now maneuver all around without expelling fuel and you'll just\nSucking in by magnets all of the metal object\nCollecting this stuff and I'm going to put it into a space junk yard and this is ... Reagan space race scrap there's an awful\nLot of high quality aluminum at all this stuff okay you know God's will their stuff so he had the space station instead of ... to get through time and burning it up it goes into the space junk yard to be re manufactured and reading [noise]\n\nNASA chief scientist Dennis Bushnell [noise]\n\nFeeling refuse collection there is another area that's become a hot topic in space come us that's mining Chris Louis is the founder and CEO of the U.S space thumb Planetree result is one of the world's first and leading prospective space mine is\nThe last decade we've seen tremendous progress not just in the topic and environment around space mining but in the development of outer space in general we now have rockets that we can reuse we've been to all the planets in the solar system we're finding moons and other solar systems [noise]\nWe've landed on comments brought back samples from asteroids rode around on their services\nAnd I think the big shift is we are passing a tipping point where there is more private money\nBeing invested in space exploration and development than public money the public money certainly paved the way as it as it almost always does and with those points an inside the exploration back from the first first explorer so to speak\nOr we can see the advantages CD operates\nStation of space and expanding human society to to new places what are you going to mine from a space mining standpoint we are today focused on those resources that you can use in space so that you don't have to bring them with you\nAnd as in all things and transportation you don't want heavy baggage you don't want to be paying for shipping very expensive heavy things\nOr you want to bring his little with you as possible and get all those things onsite age to a resume I one right war to win or ice in the form of with what you find on asteroids that was the first target these button to prevent yeah water is very likely the catalyst to opening up the space age for for you and I\nWater can in the form of age to hydrogen and oxygen be split and made into rocket fuel\nIt's the field and rockets right on right now so the ability to take that rocket that got him from the surface of the earth to earth orbit and top it off and take it farther a mixed that supply chain a lot easier and a scalable to like\nQualities that we can't even imagine millions of people living and working in space instead of a half dozen\nI can get the idea 'cause there'll be a potential so that is stationed in space for a gas station in space there will be used ... ships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium term surely because\nWe talked about economics rockets the now going up and down from us fall cheaper than they used to run I mean the cost of fuel as a proportion of a\nAn eleven month SpaceX rocket kind of shooting them spaces is actually only a tiny fraction of the costs of the overall mission so he's he's a few really good deliverable everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is this very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the year just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your talk that never has to feel the weight of gravity never has to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be permanent ... in any permanently in space and it'll it'll be that shuttle that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd sometimes you'll feel that shuttled from the surface of the earth but maybe when that shuttle gets out to geosynchronous orbit or farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids and you're going to need a ...\nColony first I mean or at least an an active and sort of industry on a ... a a population of that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the series of stepping stones that sustainably is this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects uh their multibillion dollar projects\nDecades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for a hundreds of billions of not trillions of dollars in revenue and value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computers so cheap probably never going to make money on computers\nAnd of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of that\nQuick question that if you you go you got your asteroid and you'll sites and you go up and you land on it to prospect and you come back and go yes it's got all of the things we wanted to do a lot to lose more besides but it hasn't gone by then and there's not going to be back for several decades\nThat is one of the challenges of working with asteroids as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining\nWe see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons so with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it weren't easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for how soon will this happen\nStarting to prospect on that particular restaurant in the first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NASA does billion dollar missions\nThe commercial sector still needs about a hundred million dollars to do these types of projects so it's a it's a financing challenge as many things are\nBut five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources and you think the finances that yes absolutely hundred million dollar projects are a dime a dozen around the world but uh five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first small scale\nMoney\n... here on business daily from the BBC\nLiving we discuss space tourists space factories mining even automated space refuse collection but what is the magic and all of this\nMan the space colonies when the people for example the ... the entrepreneurial must 'cause looms adjusted we should be building on mosques well the truth is according to ... ... there were many many problems to having humans living alone tub in space\nThis is one of the questions that we need to solve its Matty which is how can our bodies acclimate to the environment is zero gravity maybe it's the addition of artificial gravity of rotating space habitat that provide a sense of\nUm force that allow you to simulate grabbing better for your bones that have for your eye health every Oregon Health and we're looking at things like asked a mental health we're looking at things like social robots companions can robot companions provide some of the comfort that you usually have some say a family member hell\nAnd they can't come with you want to keep long duration space mission also looking at\nWearable for developing and monitoring astronaut biometrics understanding that physiological changes that they're undergoing in orbit and of course I miss me build on the shoulders and incredible right that's been done by NASA and other groups over the years to understand and study the effects on the human body and they're happy and\nSo what does the timeframe for all of this then nothing is Dennis ... expects the start of space mining and factories within ten years later people and for all the talk of a new frontier and new opportunities the economic viability middle remains uncertain\nEverything goes up roller skates the technology syrup roller skates okay changing rapidly the opportunities are or or or a roller skates and as we learn more we determine what we really need or don't need okay and the competition changes because the technology changes\nSo this is a very vibrant and interesting as you would have been interesting talks\nWhich basically means they were making a focus is not to be trusted just yet because they could change in the next year\nFor forecasts particularly business forecasts are generally based on data and the amount of actual real raw data\nAbout some of these things to protect the way the data of the competition\nFrom earth and other
