the secrets of planet or as we know it including how the dinosaurs became extinct\nNow live from puff Australia to do to Aaron ... who heads a team of researchers\nLike cutting university and it made the discovery thanks for talking to us on a news day festival just had a little bit more what exactly is ...\nOh it's my pleasure thanks a re died a microscopic mineral the forums when the common minerals Eric Conn gets squeezed by the crushing pressures during impact very rare\nAnd will to social impacts are we talking about you\n[noise] well read I can form out a couple of different sizes impacts but the site we founded in Western Australia near sharks they along\nThe coast or is one of the big ones that puts it in a rare class\nAnd part of the controversy is people in the past that argued about its sides are discovery of read I pushes it into a class that is an extinction class of that that doesn't mean that this impact caused an extinction but it's one of the big ones such rare in our history\nSo essentially a meteorite crushed to us and that is what you've been up just Amish\nYeah here the uncertainty behind this and why it hasn't and discovered clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the season plants just started to colonize land\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes but over time it got buried and when we want to study it today we need other means to study it so our discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense\nWell think about this if the impact that hit Mexico sixty\nThe dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have all that we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts can cause dramatic changes uh to uh to uh earth and the things living on it\nThat impacted the hundred and eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called would lay we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter\nSo it's the big one that killed the dinosaurs isn't even twice that size it's a bigger fan fest I just off of our income mostly thank you very much for talking to Newsday\n[noise] now in about Ninety minutes time world

our listeners have heard of ... tell us about her story and why it was so remarkable\nShow well thanks for having me I knew or as a personal inspiration to me because like I put into you know Indian impacts on the origin I'm an immigrant I came here the u._k. when I was five and growing up I I had heard about this woman story and it just became more residents to me\nAnd it struck me that very few people knew about whether they were all ethnic minority origin or or Asian or Indian or whether they were purchased a meaning I'm white British\nSo in terms of a story she was a Muslim sissy pacifist she was born to an Indian father an American mother and she was actually a children's writer in Paris then when World War two broke out of family moved to the u._k.\nAnd she volunteered for the women's auxiliary apples and two years later she was picked up by the special operations executive which was a special unit created by Winston Churchill and she was the first\nFemale rage to operate a to B infiltrated into any enemy occupied France aged just twenty nine years old so essentially she was part of an intelligence unit yes yeah age when the nine ...\nAnd one of the leading ones because what happened was that stop was talked to round up I'm there by next week\nAnd she was she was she she was adjusted to come back to the u._k. but she did not want to ban that have French colleagues without communication so she said and she singlehandedly this Indian woman a pacifist a Muslim sixty\nShe ran a cell of agents by herself saving countless of lives\nAnd the sad thing is she was captured by the Nazis she was tortured and famously never gave up any information and then she and others were transferred to\nA concentration camp beats and again and have a parent final word\nYou

celebrate not only ... courage but the courage of all these women who seem to be forgotten somewhat\nAnd it's just why you decided to start this campaign to honor to honor her story but also to bring it to the spotlight yes absolutely\nI mean the thing is when you look at these campaigns and and you ... your your um your listeners might know that as one campaign to to have Margaret Thatcher the former prime minister on it there's another of the sort of funny campaigns have Harry McGuire\nFootball or riding a imagine you know an inflatable unicorn on it\nAll got paid we could come in\nA an an

special\nPerson up for the forgotten figure is basically or they figure is\nA well well to quote the movie absolutely you know why don't we know about it and and and with regards to your program you know there is a wider debate society right now but you know what's taught in our curriculum\nYou know why don't you know knowing more comfortable stories knowing most of mixed heritage stories um and that that's important but also you know we've never had an we've never had a historical figure on about no that's the right to the army so this is about why to professional representation there's never been in the minority ethnic\nIt there is so much I mean there's so much going for that campaign and there is there's been a lot of support for it you think you might happens are\nYou know what I'm quite positive but the only thing you can do is keep going I'm just too but I I I had a big ... of of of inspiration earlier on because the um\nThe basically the the campaign behind the ten pound

students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in close ... there was seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crashing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed\nAnd what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well you know was studying

textbooks in retrospect she admits these books ... subjects that we huge Lee important in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had to spend a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks which we're addressing particular issues\nPublished in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system and this was very typical of the way that correct comics was taught in universities around the world and has not changed it has changed\nI write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true or not just the opposite of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics close rooms remember these are the people who graduate I'm going to steal the financial systems in which we all depend\nIf they give bad advice and can wreck your economy the growing frustration felt by students and the teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others are building a new

he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just\nKind of move on and say well I did my best I can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recalling him was on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nWere blinded by the same

center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true I think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever

will be better off just Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by then to find some other ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions\nJust isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody knows something somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students the markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating
