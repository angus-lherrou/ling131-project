Russia off the hook\nWasher is accused of violating the treaty by deploying a ground launched cruise missile in European parts of Russia this is prohibited were prohibited under the treaty you can't

and banned them globally from us and Russian arsenals so the only thing that stopping him from continuing the at the climate is the treaty you leave the treaty well that gives Russia for your hand in some ways this plays into Russia's hands\nThe second thing it does is it starts to accelerate the the arms race there's already a lot of new nuclear programs underway in both the United states and Russia and other nuclear armed states but now this will celebrate it and that's the warning the Russians are getting you know\nLaid out proposals to build to new kinds of nuclear weapons specifically for the European\nTheater submarine launched low yield weapons and see launch cruise missiles the Congress added a third aground launch cruise missiles specifically to counter the Russians so you can see the dynamic already taking off plus there's an Asian component the best we can get into if you like\nFrom what I don't have all this point the President Trump makes about Russia ... agreement for use for the world\n... it was three years ago we detected and when I was still an advisor to the state department we detected Russia deploying this missile and to be honest the Obama administration to crush very hard to fix\nThis violation the Russians have said no we're not in violation in fact you're in violation by your missile defense systems and in Poland and Romania they could be turned into office of weapons that also by the train but it hasn't been resolved that's the that's the point\nOf views on these little extra that everybody is actually abiding by the rules this there's a consulting the committee that is\nSet up by the treaty precisely to resolve this\nAnd we we we run into these kinds of\nDisagreements repeatedly an arms control agreements\nMost often they're resolved

government was sort of organizing the army as people on Twitter to silence just didn't think critics but what's a little bit extra interesting about that there's your younger proponents\nIt seems the Saudi Government to ... an engineer within Twitter to get him to sort of spy or look into certain people that counts and they fired him and twenty Fifteen and then the component of this that McKinsey and company which is a consultancy\nThey've reduced to report around twenty Fifteen\nAnd about some some\nIssues with 'em and announcing that the government had made about economic sort of changes that they were making\nAnd they begin to report flags three different Twitter users in the report and after the report surfaced somehow maybe got and they had the Saudi Government one of the man behind the counter arrested another one hadn't had computers the until his brothers were arrested and that\nWhat delete it so the question is what was McKinney during who hire them and were they involved in it now but it hasn't put out public comment McKinsey is that they're horrified if that happened but obviously it raised a lot of questions\nYeah I'm about the motor itself for Fox is still not even\n... I think a lot it's still I Know we're hearing sort of like the Saudi Government now thing has happened that they just really admitted on friday that there was a murder at all or something happened\nUm you know there's still a lot that unknown and I think from the United states has died here we're still trying to figure out how our government plan to respond to President Trump has\nBeen pretty slow to pull the trigger on anything on that that first you're saying you know will they deny it now has admitted that there are some deception but obviously we don't know what that our government will

involved in the program as miles filming who's head of the way for the center for energy environment on sustainability and joins us now from enough most current Caroline thank you very much for joining us ... surviving employees in London and all those on hopping\n[noise] well we plant them out in ways where they can use the the soil that is left when your mind and area you take the soil it's abused in a way that's almost unfathomable so it's\nTaken up through a suction pomp liquefied and all this stuff that's good in the soil gets washed out and washed downstream and what you're left with is is alien landscape\nAnd so what we had to do is figure out ways to make trees grow in that landscape\nReally poised and what sort of poisons that we're talking about [noise] the poison that goes into the soil\nMostly is mercury so the the miners and the technique of mining that's used a uses mercury to grab onto the gold and then that mercury is vaporized off the gold and then ... back into the environment so that gets mixed and the soil\nAnd so what do you plan to come up with is a bunch so\nIn the forest themselves there's over two thousand species of trees that grow out of those we've identified sixty or so\nDo pretty well and it's a mix of things that are economically important or things that are grow well in the natural kinds of her generation that are around but the real key to it isn't so much the actual species of trees that are chosen but the way that the soil is prepared in order to help them grow\nAnd how is the ...\nSo what we've done and instead of just sticking the trees and to this really alien bombed out soil that's nothing like anything that they will grow the forest we've restored it and we've done two things one is we've taken something akin to charcoal something that's called bio char that\nAbsorbs water and performs a a lattice that helped the nutrient stay in the soil and not just the nutrients but also the microbes that the plants rely on to grow to stay in the soil and then the other thing we do is just like we have a micro biome at our guts the soil has a micro biome\nAnd that relationship between the plants and the micro biome is essential for them to grow so what we do is we inoculate the soil with that and microbiology that in a little bit of nutrients really takes these plants that just\nNot just a small piece of land is not an echo of you're talking about you\nKnow it's a tremendous area so uh every year there's about ten thousand ... there are so they get turned over by mining\nAnd areas that we've been working on we've been developing the technologies are right now we have about a hundred and twenty acres spread throughout the department of modern ideas so it's a place that's about the size of Costa Rica plus half of Panama and we're working with all\nGo ahead no go ahead go ahead finish the phone\nYeah and it's a ... and we're working with all their municipalities so miners local governments and or the national government in order to give them the technology so that they can use it in the ways that are most stripped most appropriate for the\nMiners are interested in you know took village on what is going on with your collaboration because out other ways for just a bit more regulation of the mind those I'm not sure they want a little\n... yeah well it's interesting so you know when miners uh come in and then they leave they don't really care so much about regulation but a lot of these miners now are the mayors of towns and they're living there they have kids that need to go to school and they see that in the future\nYou can't just have this wave of mining spreading across the landscape so they actually want to regulate themselves ad where there to help them\nDo the kinds of things on the landscape that will help their kids thrive and help them get returns on the land that now looks like a bomb that\nWay so that really good to talk to your mouth thank you very much for sharing with

most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division\nThat's the thing that month looking full so that I think some things can be said or but these are just things that are known to social psychologist one is don't close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less they get to and then people have done so don't allow yourself to be channeled off\nInto a world in which you only are among white people only
