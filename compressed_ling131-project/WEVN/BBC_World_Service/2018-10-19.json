I'd like to begin by asking each of you will seize identity politics will do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think to my dad has been given and is used to describe\nPlanes for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to them on to equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the um because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have less to do with the identity of a sudden than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that a little bit more Adrian past what does it mean to you that politics is really about it\nSmall groups very often so cool my knowledge to such a ... for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in and countries so there's a problem I think in that\nIt's a response individualize and but I think it's an individualized response rather than a more communal collective\nResponse yes among yeah to me ... describes two very different phenomena that are going on at the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and ... on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAs sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re center the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about groups as ... elements of the state line of try to [noise]\nI think the term ... around the idea that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by groups into which we were born in that way I regarded as anti individual for ma'am part\nThough is that rather an important point Adrian how does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nOr the the problem is that you have on the one hand very

called the big sick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a white I'm Out can go into sort of dramatic life story they have no partners\nUm [laughter] I was amazed by the way in which bed movie which tells in the mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left saying what isn't the problematic that this round protecting this has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan\nAnd I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the ride was saying who cares if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left but some of food that was problematic exercise leave for me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what to do we want ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural ... on you to picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably ... identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is\nThe way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy a wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I left on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of\nCommonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation and we have to address\nThe fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we don't politics until I kind of button all Hollywood wrong call not allowed\nTo bring you in 'cause he wants to come into the air I think on the issue of they'll GB T rights and the way that change but feel free to comment on what President\nI think the we what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics\nIs that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off\nEven buy a millimeter and that's a turn off it also create a social atmosphere of fearful illness on uh\nJust on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and uh you know if you're at a party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them\nAnd not ugly or as they get to ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying\nAnd they make people socially fearful agents\nIt's intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined as more than the ... of course they're real differences out than to be celebrates it but they also the coming out she's that's how we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political\nContest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus on this shouldn't be warm\nBut the memory simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think that politics has become\nSo do I ... I I really would like Exxon tell us I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I for the handwringing about authoritarianism and lack of commonality and differences\nBut I'm not hearing an example of the only example that would get annoyed with black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo so let me give you a couple of examples of what I Want to make clear but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument but ... but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers are those are true but the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry ... off the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be a more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat\nThere is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's ...\nWhite people who got shot by the police as well one last quick question to you before we wrap up this tough people have never lived in multicultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new\nSituation that we find ourselves in why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's just because my guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some fee no longer function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations and the communities are not working and I think that's why people fail\nThis was a sense of powerlessness as a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the center then Tuesday's fight a finished an exclusive\n... I think mass migration has something to do with it we're talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which\nVoice and then of course technology is an amplifier Russia\nWhen it started to disagree with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a ... ethnic multi cultural self conception of themselves and find God who started to challenge fat and we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies but that is something I've talked to quite new\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of\nThe world's wealth and one of the ways in which that addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a\nFalse and indeed authoritarian narrative out that way by age as minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering okay\nPlans to think about that thank you for ... panel\nBanned by the Gopal yes among ... and Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think that the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us at the real story at BBC don't kettle UK or tweet me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll to cost app [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR where support comes from you our listeners and from Vermont coffee come organic coffee in the brown paper bag available at your local grocery store for my coffee company coffee roasted for friends\nAnd from watching seals and selling these deals assisted living in Dover\nMore information on geriatrics with a sense of humor at ... dot com [noise]\nA gift to engage the are the are they plan is a wonderful legacy to leave for\nWhich is an interesting and important point I wanted to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German state elections into that area what happened that this is a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to ... to the ASU which has dominated politics\nIn that part of Germany for decades found itself hemorrhaging votes were still at the end of the biggest policy but a much smaller but a policy than it had been\nHemorrhage bites the greens on one side and the anti immigrant asked the on the other meanwhile the S. P. D. which is the left a sense of ... ...\nIt seems that those his entourage choosing policies which have clear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say they if the anti immigrant uh you know I'm white time working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and the biggest space people pushing themselves into those\nBut I think now because the mainstream parties offering something that's inclusive and off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with ... of course the working class is not simply washing and lots of other components of the of the working class have suffered an often suffered more than the white working class but\nSaying the other people have suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide also you know we'll rebelled against substations quote and and who are we to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much less the mass of all there's not a small thing I'm not saying you did what I'm saying\nThe idea that somehow we can just say we're able to be most depressed people under the only ones that my son and in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the watch approaching ... rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe are people who are involved each we're people embedded in relationships institutions are not since feelings do methane is angel belonging and and they were going to place to people to communities and countries masses we kind of feeling out of politics I only got to\nThe obvious question that followed from that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease parts of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing offensive on the longing that she ... the identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far end of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly\nYou're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but that's that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tried then they want representatives\nWho are going to put their case most forcefully and advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say ... voice is a very clear that on Nick durable\nIn some ways it works if you'll never end or a movie in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it wins votes\nEspecially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic um in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive\nClumps sorry Ken I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but we've just been told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups\nIt's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's all\nPolitics happens because those tribes are bad but other tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad at all I don't take it out yeah I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious or ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in ... the society in a productive\nManner but one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWant to look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years I don't think that's realistic because ... especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domesticated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim it for ourselves to make that inclusive to say that he's a high or a collective uh it is a level of magic kingdom of looking at states but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups\nUnder the common identity and how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite\nTo being if you like a flag waving patriots\nI'm ... I think patrons during the time I just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know doc a side of history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nTo play on the other hand over all the things that he's saying that you love found that it how do you enjoy it isn't that are going to talk what's wrong and loving your country and its people accused other people of identity politics but I'm saying you're not just because you remember your poster nationalism I imagine you are and you know you're\nYou're you're ... you're saying making my country but I Know how much I Want to tell me\nAnd I said most of Hindu majority of them so I look at nationalism and that's something that had served its purpose in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the writer response will be the ... for it is the or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians are respected for\nMe that he is not true I mean it's not as though the older a form of nationalism the Congress party didn't have ... elements to it the one and that was just out of areas of angry as well as looked at what\nAnd if if I can bring you back then in a sense there there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such gets as well\nJust between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be London us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's found bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further that kind of cosmopolitan isn't that you also spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think at the ... I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and the answer is that\nIf everybody identifies primarily with us up national try and say I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live together productively in peacefully whereas if we had our sense of collective pride at the level\nWhich coincides with the actual ...\nInnocence doesn't everybody carry multiple and of course on the edge of the nation between the identity is which you choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted upon mostly\nDo and the people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fight for the cause of people who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest as Americans and other ... emphasize the ways\nIn which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of the whole members accounted vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent and let's demonize any form of collective flowing above the level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a common ... that's\nA bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British national at something that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a sub nationalism that his English nationalism the way the Brexit\nVote broke down there is a clear correlation between what you would call ... nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast and so again it's I don't think we can have the right fit into that I ended up ...\nWhile I mean actually quite a lot of people ... did vote for that I I personally am not expecting that majority ... right but but but I think what what you see here is different notions\nW ... eighty eight point three W.

Paris in fact he was such a respected authority that during the war the Nazi general hunting and gathering wanted to employ Mr wind that got to verify the auto ... looted wind the guy refused and so the Nazis pill for his collection too\nBut last month off to Seventy is a painting from his collection to women and a garden by Renoir was finally returned to Sylvie at Christie's in New York\nThe ... you know say that the Morgan bank and that's where the Nazis told them most of them were found after the war that we're still paintings missing five hundred law including the one I received back in New York where\nYou will wed this one particular painting had been missing all alone\nNo never I never heard about this story\nThe war was a taboo subject I suppose that when my grandfather died you would never expect we could find his painting so long afterwards and he died I was Fifteen so I was very young and I had no idea about what happened\nAnd I discovered many things up to my mother died now I must say that I've got tons of questions but it's only five or six years ago that I was told that\nThere were a paintings that belonged to my grandfather ... ... what did it must have been quite a shocking revelation [laughter] yes\nAnd after a few weeks I've been told that that guy was investigating on the property of the painting and the American government decided that it's your painting so they going to give it back to you so I was a\nYes you did not know that it belonged to you I mean has it made you more curious to go and look at what other religious property there is that belong to a grandfather\nWhat we know actually about the five other paintings but I've got an everyday life and honestly I'm not leaving with that kind of idea I think I'm already been very lucky to get one back\nBut you can't do it when you you can't keep this particular painting\nUnfortunately not because the French government compensated for the paintings so as I have it back I have to give the government the money back\nWhich means you have to know anything to raise the money to do that\nExactly yes yes\nI'm quite disappointing if you I mean so keeping it in your family is no longer an option even though it's being returned to you\nKnow it's not an option and fortunately of course I Would have loved to keep it because it's a huge symbol for me and my family but that's life\nSylvie ... said the painting had been on a Seventy year old is he from South Africa to London through Switzerland in New York before a gallery called puck west in Florida bullshit from some of these ... sold it to a private collector\nAnd money trying to spot it was not see ... to ... it says it prompted compensated that by it but the gallery is now in ten seeking compensation for subtleties with no luck so far pull sweat is the lawyer for ... calorie\nSubsidies were selling it at auction so they can try and obtain their relief from whoever gave the peace to them\nBut the idea that it's part of course that should you know suffer the financial loss when we're part in good faith from southern ... they're represented the provenance of the piece to be on blemish them without question park was paid good value for the peace so everything about ...\nTransaction where subsidies was arm's length in good faith ... park west would have had no notice no knowledge does know wasn't any red flag whatsoever that would have clued park west into the fact that this was actually stolen from the Weinberger family by the Nazis\nDatabase somewhere that tells you which pieces of art a stone Leno or considered you know suspect in some way\nThankfully there is unhelpful either database did not list this peace and to solve a non\n... it's a common occurrence I mean does it happen quite a lot that you come across pieces by famous artists who he kind of wonder where it came from\nNo no it's unusual and it's my understanding that the Weinberger airs only became active after twenty ten\nSo presumably some of these will say the same thing it was not listed on any day today so holiday to know\nYour presumably their relationship to the piece goes back to at least Nineteen Seventy five looks like it's sold to suffer these auction in March of Nineteen Seventy five in London and then it's so began through south the bees in December Nineteen Seventy five in Johannesburg so\nThey certainly have a much longer relationship with this peace what they knew when they knew it that's for them to answer not us but our view is quite simple they sold us a piece that was stolen and so therefore they shouldn't reimburse us the purchase price just as we did\n... sweat some of these told us they did offer to reinvest ... gallery for that Renoir but the auction house says park west calorie refused that off\nLucy incidence is worldwide headed restitution I saw the days his department dealt with that particular looted when law\nThat was a document that mentioned this work as having been looted from the ... family in Paris during World War two\nBut that document miss described the painting as a landscape with a woman sitting down\nAnd of course not always look at the painting which we're talking about can we realize it's not a single woman sitting down but it's two women sitting down\nAnd it also has different dimensions to the paintings defined bogus listed as missing\nSo they made to material mistakes which actually made it impossible to match up the painting which was offered for sale by\nChristie's by Sotheby's and by an auction house in Switzerland\nSeveral times I've been really ... ... what you mean struggling still ...\nTrained by someone who studies reading was it seems like such a small technicality whether or not this one woman or two women\n... it would seem so from his point of view common sense but Renoir was wonderful artist but he was also prolific\nAnd there are a re a very large number of landscapes all of which are like the difference\nThat was basically no flag to suggest that this is the painting\nWhich defined burgers last\nJust simply as a profit from restitution for example do an fees from options to provide cash reimbursement to the true owners\nWere commercial ... thoughts one of the things I told my colleagues when we're pushing them to do more and more research on paintings\nIs the best way to lose a client is to expose them to not was titled playing from the ... era so we make enormous efforts to protect our laws and to basically protect the market by doing the research before paintings were for sale\nShowed that the salt they lose money when it has to wrestle outlets like this\nI Can't generalize for suck me where we find a situation where a painting was dislocation and more to\nAs a matter of policy be trying to bring the various parties together\nAnd it's not a question of profit this question I'm trying to the right thing and to be\nJust illustrate to Sacramento however lung cancer\nLucien Simmons at Sotheby's and what about the victims\nEven though it took Seventy is Sylvie sit it said to recover a painting the Nazis looted from her grandfather she's just happy that is finally being returned so I leave the last what for me ... and today was produced alerts night business daily it's back again at the same tunnel Monday\nYou know I have had the most beautiful gift I could have in the justice for my family that's the main thing the painting I've seen it in my heart for either\nAnd what happened in New York is also in my heart and in my mind [noise] you know the end of my life and that very
