I Know we sold out at the moment\nI Know I Know but you know what they have nothing right now like it's very difficult for artists to go there and tour because it's not worth it like in the economy excite economy side but also people are afraid to go out during the night you know to concerts and so they try to make countries like early during the day\nSo they don't have to be exposed to like you know at eleven PM leaving the theater so yeah for me was also surprised that it was sold out even though it was during the night but yeah they're they're they're just like a craving for talent and for people to go on sing for them\nAnd when you are an all just from a country that has highlighted the moment full suddenly all the wrong reasons mhm do you feel that sense of pressure to perform to writes about it to sing about who to to put some sort of message out there about the situation back home of color pressure\nIt comes naturally that we want to talk about it that uh as I said because my family's there I'm not I'm really far from the ... can I say that yeah from the situation because I talked to them everyday and they're living at you know\nSo I think it's something that has happened naturally for us to talk about it or to express how we feel and it's more about missing\nMy family missing the beautiful beaches we have they're missing the fact that like if I Want to bring people to go on and see where I'm from they they don't want to go because\nWhat they see the news and uh it's not too pretty [laughter]\nUm so but yeah I I'm hopeful you know like I think things are going to get better because they have to and people are very very brave and when I went last time people are still working you know he was young people young people with a smile on their face\nJust very happy to be there and working for a better better Venezuela and that was very touching for me\nAnd then the good times ... redrawing and look\nFor you really have to visit it's not because I'm from their release you all go to a really beautiful I think it's perfect the whether we have actually it's maybe Ninety degrees the whole year\nI Know it may sound bad for you is actually very uh it's amazing because we have the wind or the food is grade people are happy all the time every time I showed pictures to people there like what the hell are you doing here [laughter]\nType ... and another is bringing London for the first time of the year after London jazz festival the twenty fifth of November just some photo brief words from you both but it's an interesting insight into into somebody performing abroad because she has to be a broad ... reflections on family she's missing what's going on back home\nYou know what ... what does one through the coal mine to ensure when you're talking to her when she started to touch on the delicate political situation it was the coded language yeah I remember that from the years with the military dictatorship Brazil\nYou was a coded language there are things that you wanted a pass or would you couldn't actually say yeah because we were first you're worried about what would happen to family exactly yeah she's got family there so few word\nYeah yeah I\nI think it's interesting that she said people are less ... for college for ... of course a might cut I got used to be a mainly allies Sandy I I actually have a friend living there and um I Can't understand that say concert was sold out so I agree with\nBoth of them to do well listen we're going to have a bit more of her music [noise] going to say thank you to both of you for joining the smart thing\nAgain I\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to image we are we're support comes from you our listeners man from the New Hampshire school administrators association representing school superintendents and administrators championing the education of children every day and age ... dot\nOrg and from the loss and group protecting companies most valuable assets people\nProviding workers cuff wellness and health and safety services the Lawson group dot com [noise]\nRising stars awards recognize outstanding young professionals and innovative companies around the state I'm Keith McDermott data and investigations reporter and H.

smaller scale features like tornadoes that right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will have to be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks\nBack [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models with suggesting we were heading for something of a coma\nLet me issue and mea culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen those temperatures were not unusually warm\nWe were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... raised with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description outside from friday\nHeard of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one\nAnd we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists\nAnd that pattern is in uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming\nAnd were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initialized ... so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point a degree Celsius\nAs well as changes that there had on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform\nA changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that the climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in this set up\nThese patents have geographical variation ... look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a wall still fall out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius\nSo there is a very large region in the Atlantic the sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier\nWere seen storms turn into major hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic look potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many events that have mocked the past few months\nMelting foster most some of those and recovery more poorly each winter Julian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seeing herself the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOne of the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up an ice camp and also thick enough\nTo support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also
