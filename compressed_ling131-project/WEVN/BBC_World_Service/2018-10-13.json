know the whole place it's up on the tunnels in front of a life and movement takes energy\nLike oil and gas\nHere this week the governmental panel on climate change came out with its latest report I won't be hearing from one of the office and environment\nIt's actually the report that we can't go on line [noise] and if we do like a danger the stabilize the F ...\nCities cars and buses and everything else around they it's getting to need to be palate by renewable\nCivil what's that going to do the economy and can we have the kind of ... we've got used to what we have to get used to something maybe something less dynamic what does that mean that politics can lead is way down to make the sacrifices\nWell there is a pretty tough questions that they get back to the theater now need half\nAnd a panel is Laura Diaz ... professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University bubbled he's the policy director at the Grantham instituted climate change at the London School of economics\nJulius ... he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University I'm Molly Scott K. to an end of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests than and nuts you reverse gal he's one of the office of this week's IPC see reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report calls for the well to aim to keep the rising label temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius\nBut that's going to comment to price\nIs the well on track to me anything like that target festival\nTo clarify that the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the government has asked the IPC\nIn two thousand Fifteen independents agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is an important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd so just to be clear is the well I'm trying to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rule is knock on track currently the pledges of the countries that they submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereabouts in mission should be decreasing very very deeply by twenty thirty\nSo painted the picture ... the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for example for coral reefs are two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive\nAt one point five degrees of warming it is still possible that some of them survive also for four to ... ecosystems there is a really clear shift in the impacts\nOur primary energies and every kilowatt hour every message will is among those is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys flying\nNot everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things into you know five\nFlying is one of the most environmentally damaging TV's one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that people especially at the ... we just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable live how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible a signing on American my nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard and so it's important to people on the ... the ... and climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in her life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality ... they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world that is both lowering emissions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jobs that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs and long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten thousand people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however short time cause that's an equate\nMake samples we know that the increasing an extra ... prices seem that you cannot other content in other countries have hurt the most a low income people are larger share of\nTheir income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no losers what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've are emerging seventies all their high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit\nSeen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to me to get these short\nTerm ... cases I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the television we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effective\n... greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can say the oil financial products or pension products have to be aligned with the one point five powers target for example I can argue that and I'm In the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for they say look ahead and they imagine a world of these climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is as real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it just went to us today is that when asking the question who's going to pay to for\nThis one we should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one does\nThis reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and went on asking the question we're going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay for future climate impacts if you\nDon't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today they're projected to increase significantly already Rick won't four and five degrees of warming\nAnd read to degree or form in ... in the\nFar future this is um one point five current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so does this reading not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for ducked down the road and find them eat\nThe report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefree managed and they have to carefully managing managed to adopt this you know the poor of the impact of this or that they can be compatible with sustainable development and entering a real welfare Laurie wants to\nCome back and yeah I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a Ninety nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are the ...\nThe past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly cities is making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance the agreed no but there is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is\nThat it's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize and there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's these invest managing it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough\nAs they say the report is reminding us okay but I Do think this point that he's made all their report about making sure that the most vulnerable are not hurt it's not just necessary for ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons I guess only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember the\nGlobal economy is not stuffing and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double\nNinety to ... and we'll be invested in New infrastructure infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the population living in cities around the world is like it's a double in the next four years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive for\nWe designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRole of of um the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap up this how fast for now thank you to a panel throughout the as an adult ... Julius ... cases\nA year we were a gal will tell you a short break ... just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas to topics he likes to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC ... will treat me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have the ... cost you can subscribe to just such for the real story and you'll put cost up\nYour distribution of the b._b._c.

quickly as possible damage deficient in cheapest way to do that through a new those\nSo we'll come evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nFive investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoint is one of them is that what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... effects on\nThe planet and our own humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the can you imagine anything\nThat the scientists could say that would be swayed the administration but it needs to take this seriously\nOh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they got nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost I think\nStates it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern to it is something but the American government her signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide gate and of course that trait how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it's simply cheaper to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts all becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including coal mining industries um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people of a job she's\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record the storm surge associated with that\nIs big up because it's the level rise is a good chance that the warmer than average waters and the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to see her all at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nIn low carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas these idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked a lot about the first world the very developed well let's turn if we may ... to ... the willed that a growing I won't speak to treat the ... he's a professor of environment and

there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda as much more to talk about renewables but at the same that made me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy\nThey could actually have huge savings in health\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a fossil fuel and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing\nIs simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you liked caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay\nFor it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five\nAt that time the developing countries are doing the north must take action ... no it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways\nTo buy bonds the mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north tried to convince a bench and funds to stop investing in fossil fuels but the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels\nOr the investments to the south and I thought about a good idea to shifting the problem effect right and so I Do think developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think for a country like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea [noise]\nThe problem with democracy is a false is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science and I really think that if he can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains\nStock to melt the snow starts to them as in the mountains\nAnd so as a consequence if you're just trying to look at the agricultural sector in India the postal sect in India\nThey will really suffer and there's a reason to take their views into account and try to read visit our energy storyline\nSoon there's a big reasons for India to make changes similarly big reasons for China to make changes do you think China may ultimately\nChina's been going for a sort of both and strategy of growing all energy times at once but I think any kind of well run country any kind of country that has a government that cares about its population will in fact be pushed by that population if that population as well informed enough about the risks that are coming down the line and are very near future\nNationally eighty eight

the stage for racial integration\nOr fifty four people have survived as since the beginning of this outbreak but the real difficulty at the moment is not it's just you know the last time that there's an outbreak in a conflict area a and said the security situation is is very tense but that that the other issue is not there is a lot of community mistrust\n... mall but significant pockets as of communities of people who are resisting 'em ... who are quite skeptical of the of the virus in their response and making a ... is that that was very difficult that the ...\nYes because we heard about these um the red cross volunteers who are trying to swiftly removed borders being attacked\nAbsolutely I you know this is it's quite common to have community mistrust and then they voted on break it's very scary virus a wet people there's a lot of people dying to oversee people that are very scattered but I think you know the specifics itchy when this outbreak is that it's happening happening in an area\nWhere there's been decades of conflict and so there's a lot of tension or in in the community uh you know just last week Eighteen\n... ... people were killed in an attack by ... group on in Danny this week four people were killed in an attack on the city as well and so people are very very scared and angry and there's been a lot of protest\nActually being done yet and I meant I against rising insecurity and not the result of that it's making the response is very difficult and I'm I I'm being told that every day at the moment at genes how teams have to stop for a few hours either because it shoots hang\nAround the city because of protest\nAnd this is hampering ... their response or the tracing his contacts if people who could be at risk I it's it's making vaccination a slow at ... and ... and making the burials ah the burials molten logistical than that is really a key part of the year better response\nAh because at the guy that virus that is that is very contagious I ... on on someone who has died and said the burials is ready I keep haunted their response and this is why they've instilled the new security measures wet and he's at school it's all they double at full burial teams if needed\nLouis divest our correspondents in the capital of the deal sea congested thank you for making time for us on the program this morning Joan assemble the vital or just is with me in the studio here in London Jonathan you wouldn't know particularly vigorously when Louis was talking about how we usually this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately an of course there's a lot of a local coach or an on local\nUh practices that involves quite close contact with a dead body and so in past outbreaks Hussein that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's why it's it's crucial took a lot about the buried as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult to do that if you can't get access to the communities\nAnd of course the other elements as well is this a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that the very simple measures you you identify people who are infected\nYou isolate them and then you monitor the context of those people and if any of them becoming ... to ... them and by just doing this isolation ... or ... monitoring can very quickly bring an outbreak under control because you can't do the\nIf it's in a in an area of great civil unrest\nAnd the coolest wet actually there was this trust all modern medicine\nAbsolutely on this huge mistrust and again we've ... we had from Louis that there's a very effective vaccine works really well in the in the twenty fifth outbreak in guinea which is really where it was a given his first opportunity\nUm this is a very effective vaccine in these sorts of outbreak conditions but again you needs to be able to get into the communities you need to have than willing to be vaccinated so this is an incredibly challenging time\nThe world Health Organization is saying it may be another three or four months before this latest outbreak is brought under control just how bad could things get in the timeframe\nThe worry is that there are cases which is a a cropping up in in very disparate parts of the the regions of the moment the outbreak comes around two hundred square kilometers and I'm not saying the whole of the areas got a boat or infections but there are little so sigh of outbreaks\nAnd of course if you spread your resources over great geographical area becomes incredibly challenging trying to do something about so whether it's two months three months or even longer who knows at the moment\nThis question the one last one is ... this is a disease which so far has been largely can find to places like the tea or see but the the war\nAnd then be spread around the world how big a risk is that briefly 'cause\nThere's there is a risk that it can be taken to to other countries as we saw in the twin cities you know break but then is unlikely to spreads too much unless those places haven't got great health infrastructure\nJonathan we'll come back to you during the course of the program as soon as we can from the BBC well subsidized five forty

targets and we're heading towards the rise of three degrees Celsius it says we need to make unprecedented changes to the way we live our lives and dramatically reduce\nOur use of coal and such changes will inevitably cost trillions of dollars between now and the twenty thirty five so is any of this\nRealistic to discuss this we brought together handler macaca former prime minister of New Zealand or the former head of the United nations development program and the helm professor of energy policy at new college ...\nIt's one of those moments of truth I mean if you look what's happening globally we are miles from the project power that the I PCC recommend and we're a long way from the kind of measures they have in mind so\nWe have but in China and nearly one thousand gigawatts of cold now ... they're building two hundred and fifty new ... stations in China and they're supporting two hundred coal plants\nOutside China as part of that development programmers and they're growing at about six to seven percent parental which means China will be as an economy twice its current size\nWithin the space of about ten to twelve years [noise] southern India China and Africa all growing six seven percent or we go coal maintaining its role in the international stage and we've got the oil companies projecting the old demand will go on up\nI think it's going to be very very tough because it cools full unprecedented action by countries and we're not seeing unprecedented section at this point\nReally we're going to need the most incredible political will and heavy lifting to get the policy setting some place\nTo change one of the moment is not looking at one point five ... to to Greece future but something much much worse with with catastrophic implications when I was prime minister I was aware of\nPolling evidence said do you think the government should do something about climate change to nearly everybody says yes yes they should\nAnd then when you say well you prepared to pay more fuel Petro to do something about well nowhere near as many people think like they should do that and said it requires very bold leadership\nI think it's to the credit they like the sea seat to push out this kind of science based report about what has to be a little bit careful about how it's done so one of the great illusions that those who like myself I Want to do a great deal about climate change\nI've been guilty of propagating is telling the public that you know you can have the greatest transformation from my almost overwhelmingly fossil fuel based world economy to one that's based on renewables et cetera within the spice of the few to ... do you know what it isn't going to cost you anything in fact it's gonna be economic growth and Hans ... now I don't think\nThat an all the evidence is is uh haven't clock correctly said\nThat when the public are found to be paying for this and they've been told that he wasn't going to cost much\nThey tend to react negatively and ended up ... world how you get the population of China to persuade the Chinese leadership not alone the Republican support base in America the trains Mr Trump's mind\nThat these are really quite big also and the truth is China is a coal part of why we're going to experience very significant climate change unless we can find a way is writing the Chinese leadership do otherwise\nAnd I think we should also heed the woods of next to the way he said you are the pine now to make the transition all you've got to pay a mainstream or light to that for the adaptation to the catastrophes what we really do this transformational leaders who are prepared to tell the public that they can't get almost lay off\nW.

have a chat with and I know a lot of people do that this is the opportunity to socialize so that's the other side of the spectrum as well somebody might be doing what they do want to skate and things

you're far more receptive to the people around you because you're not complete to feel like as a sort of social unit\nUm when you're with and and a couple you're often often quite sort of hermetically

you go at holiday when you're in ...\nWas intrigued by by what Leslie said the ... that she did the west coast three times and the last time with her husband and I think when you do go on a visit places on your own it it's very often that you you want to share those\n... of Egypt or whatever it might be that sort of when you're on on your own it's not quite the same as sharing that experience with with other people having said that there is nothing like more than going out in the evening on my own with a book having a pizza and an a beer but then I find my own company ... very rewarding\nYou talk about sharing your experience just so even when you are right and you're right I I have lots of friends who go on holiday on that right and I'm well that that they're sharing experiences ... by that that telephone she'll eat the days when you could really get one holiday on you I don't go off and yeah I guess\nWith with with you know we live in a an age of Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and so that there is no such thing as as as isolation associate ... a social isolation from your friends but I think it's the physical presence I think it up so much more to those experiences and then posted a picture on onto a ...\nOn your own on holiday that's miserable say high point ...

I'm healthy way and it was very dangerous how to a party is such as of now and now they are a pretty right wing doubt pretty anti immigration\nBut you're saying it was actually different at the beginning really\nYes it was it's a big difference though there are some persons at the beginning to was told a nationalistic stuff but they were just a little of men minority but nowadays I read that the majority and they add to absolutely power in the ...\nSo why was the policies that you found it so attractive to well I hate to use the word that racist\nI think that while I'm the cause of the demand that the euro or should be replaced was a Dutch mock so that was maybe a signal to them that this is a nationalist party\nWhat was the final straw for you when did you decide to walk out\nThat was a terroristic attack at the ... flats in Berlin and I did yes exactly and I was in the Facebook groups and saw how to my party colleagues aware happy about it because they said that this will give us more welders and stuff\n'cause this was a ... who's asylum application has been turned down and actually go to people in the after he pointed to the U.S and said see we told decide\nExactly really a lot of party colleagues were happy about that and I was totally disgusted by this reaction and that was no uh humanity that was no one was ... was feeling sad about it\nDid work for them was it good news for them\nYes it was a soda the party get more a worse and more of a percent and the\nAnd the world of a significant people in the year after year said some pretty explosive things in recent times ... hawk criticized the Holocaust memorial in balloon or from a pet tree you work closely with rocket petri said the migrant should be turned away with firearms if necessary\nFor time I was in the position that I had to defend those positions and the longer I stayed in the ... the more I'm happy I was just as the well up land and the more I had the feeling that I Can't do it any longer and that I have to go\nIt was only last year that you left in the position of the I have to use that we all know it was pretty well established by then why did you stay for so long\nSo for two years from two thousand Fifteen to twenty thousand Seventeen I was into a position in the party\nThese very radical members out of the party or at least out of the important positions\nBut did you really think that was possible because the AFDC while its position on most things is pretty well known and understood by everyone isn't it\nYeah it's a ... ad was a bit and they ask about the ... I was the leader of the use insects and me\nAnd I was knowing the person who got my position when I Would leave and he was very radical and I was the really cared about him and it was really hard for me to leave my place to to leave all these influence allowing was hit and\nYes and you've by studying you've collected well an extraordinary story which you've written a new book inside I F D and you have threats as a result of writing this book\nYeah absolutely um that's lots of problem before cause I was in a position to the radicals in the FD but when I leave the party then I recognize that there is no\nSelf control to some members they uh they sent me a message so about ... cans of to me and my family or a wishing me to get raped or\nTo be killed or something like this but I ... and I could\nGive people hope close a lot of persons in Germany are scared because they have family members or friends who are in the ... are infected with this right wing and positions they are very scared about it\nAnd so I think maybe I can give them some hope that they are of friends can go back from this development\nTo you talk about them being skip but how scatter you I mean receiving death threats won't fool them did they take ... how seriously do you think they were meant\nI changed my hair cut and I was hoping that will help but I don't know exactly how a serious they are when I'm reading out of my book in a lectures than I have a a bulletproof west and a buddy guards but outside of his lectures or\nI can move freely and so after some time I and I was not thinking about it\nToo much you think C I F ... should be stopped how's that going to happen\nSo ... the German constitutional protection Institute I think they have to make the process starting to forbid the FD course\nThe leader of the party addicts them all and you open the last party Congress and then he said that it should be a resolution\nAnd this revolution should stop at the streets\nHe might say that but he and his party is standing for election yes and I swam across it can if you vote for him surely that's democracy in action\nYes but we are in Germany we have to experience from the ... that but there are some positions at parties should never to ... and in Germany we have some that red lines\nWhat you call and say without being forbidden as a party and if you say you want to attack the democracy then there is the constitutional protection Institute and they are able to\nMake 'em you additional protests against the party to forbid them\nFrom the ... the author of inside a after you're listening to that Leslie ... and join us in Boulder Jonah food he's all about immigration and the end is nude it is\nBut but ultimately it's about the fact that it's globally we're we're in a recession lots of people are feeling pool um lots of commentators argue that it is very often\nYou see people who who are feeling that a publicly even more than ... particularly manual work is ... is oh drying up\nAnd they're looking for somebody or something to blame and unfortunately often political leaders are pointing the finger at its immigrants uh I as a convenient I'm sort of a blame\nBut those economic conditions that you talk about all the very conditions that very often lead people to leave that country is in search of a better life in a rich country\n... economic migration has been going on forever or an you can absolutely understand why people looking to leave places that are politically or there's a lot of unrest\nAlso if the poor people you can see why they they want to better their lives on the often they're willing to do the jobs that the others aren't willing to do is we've seen particularly in the u._k. for example with lots of Eastern European work has come into the to do the jobs that British people wouldn't do it\nYeah I thought the interesting thing unemployment in this country is at a wreck cool low and yet this trend arguably the whole Brexit vote was very much focused on this whole issue of migration out of hostility to people coming to this country\nIt was ... and I spent most of my childhood in a a a coal field in in nothing I'm Shia Mansfield I think you had something like Seventy percent of votes for leaving Jordan the referendum and indeed is now recently written to conservative MP which was totally unheard of\n... most of those few pills because the the whole composition of Mansfield has changed over the past decade on there are lots of eastern Europeans living there and I think people feel that the that culture is being changed\nLeslie

ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change has come out with a special reports about one point five degrees of warming so one thing is all these protections are against a changing global climate was presumably you've actually didn't have it\nSo it is that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change we know if that were not to happen then for example if we could expect reductions in yields yet other changes in diet of people that might make them an healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if we go on on our trajectory would be protected might be an underestimate actually\nMarket spring than from the Oxford Martin program on the future of food renewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any sort of electrical power doesn't put CIA too into the atmosphere I think grunting sauce making a\nThings were sued by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research Harvard University's David Keith backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally is to do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and some of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other\nYou know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power winter the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end the atmosphere is one big heat edge and it's driven by power from the sun\nAnd that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place there's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation of energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the arguments are most\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third if ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequences at that point three percent is almost irrelevant but it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nJust a patient at the energy and the wins that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heated momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequence\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind some might build said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a wind farm so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't give a cooling effect does a grant from the wind taking heat from the soil what what is it it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night when turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then\nThe biggest effect is it night yes\nHow much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit if it's weak king but that would be with publishing\nWell I mean the effects in the region where large wind farms are seem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that\nThe issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so winter binder immensely better than coal and we have to be carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we did carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one when I'm On a global scale I supposed to have a big effect you modeling is for lunch numbers of wind farms\nBut one wind farm doesn't have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting so one wind turbine does a very infinitesimal amount to reduce global climate change by ...\nThe wind turbine very slightly reduces climate change over the whole next century over the whole world that one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs this just slightly dented the benefits of wind farms are what you know it's all together\nI don't think it wipes out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution impacts and given the very long time scale of of seemed to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power\nBut I think it's important that the community begin to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density as of winter brown a race basically how much power you get from a single square kilometer of land with winter buys and\nPeople have suggested some very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer\nWe've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet and we get a number it's more like half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than ... important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWill last important because I Know that you were very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from some of the power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more was per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them both and would care about but the point here is about how much land humans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you know have environmental and social impacts\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transitioned we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you and the big important are finding I think is that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than a land footprint of wind for the same generation and in addition when has this climate impact and these climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new thoughts on when the power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at this time going on at the Keith climate\nThere's a link to his papers by his blog site to borrow a Web page uh BBC will ... comb that like most Scientists David was happy to talk to us
