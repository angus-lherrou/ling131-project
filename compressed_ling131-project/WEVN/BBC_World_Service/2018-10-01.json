I'm\nJust remind us so why does the government wanted to demolish it\nThere's a few levels you have to understand here the the reasoning that the government is giving is that it's a simple planning issue which you know sounds innocent enough but there's two other issues that place here and one is that we're talking about occupied territory\nAnd according to human rights groups of the Palestinian authority's and ah most world leaders forcibly displacing protected population and occupied territory is anything from a war crime to a grape Richard international law and on the geopolitical level it the location of the village is very very important\nUm it's it's in a place of the west bank where if\nThe Palestinian population is removed and Israeli settlements coming to replace them where there's already settlements or\nExist in there are many people say that it would it would cut the west bank into two different pieces I'm making a contiguous territory impossible should we ever see some sort of peace deal mhm and it would also cut off\nEast Jerusalem which many people uh [noise]\nThe Palestinians and much of the world believe to be a will be the capital of the ... of a Palestinian state middle cut it off from the rest of the west bank\nOkay so if people have been living here since the Nineteen fifties not Israeli government said the structures we built on state owned land without comments from the Israeli miniature he which undid the Nineteen Ninety three ... a call it's has extensive control over construction in sixty percent of the west bank known as Area C suggests this fall within ...\nIt does the residents claim that it's actually privately owned land owned by a a nearby Palestinian town\nUh but the other thing you have to understand about Area C and and there's really control there is that the Israeli military which is responsible for approving a building permits and in that area that you mentioned denies\nWell over Ninety percent of Palestinian requests for building permits and the residents of one of the smart one of their their last ditch attempts to stave off this this demolition was to submit a their own planning\nAnd their own master plan for for normalizing the the the the building permits of of their village and something that Israeli government allows settlers Jewish Israeli settlers to do when when they're caught building a what the Israeli government uh describes says go ahead\nMichael surely the Israeli government then has offered them an alternative place to go to despite an international objection to this has been an alternative pace in where would that be then\nThere is it's a a location not too far away um\nIt's also very close to a trash dumped a which is you can imagine it's not as not ideal for this for these residents and the other the other problem they have with it is that it's it would presumably stop them from a continuing their\nUh their lifestyle which involves are\nHurting and and other agrarian aspects\nOkay and it has become an international issue we said there's been a note of international objection to this including the un advising against it but Israel has not\nSaid what's likely to happen if this should go ahead\nYou know the Israeli government has been trying to to sort of take over the Syrian or moves the Palestinian population for a few decades now and up until the Trump Administration the Americans and the rest of the world have essentially told the Israeli government do not do this\nAnd now there's very little resistance I'm at the European Parliament warned that it would be a grave rich rich international law uh last year or many European countries warned Israel that there would be a reaction at this happened but it doesn't seem that there's any any real threat\nOkay Michael I'm the editor in chief often nothing is raining academe ...\nScientists have discovered that a key processing the Christ of life may have taken place in outer space rather than on us fosters compounds revised so adamant and the creation of DNA but they may have made that journey here from ... to Stella dust clouds presser Ross ... has been leading the research he spoke to ...

La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be comma every year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThough that impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty Eighteen so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the uh system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out or around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change in how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks jobs a gruff tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least ... among annual averages fu ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages early parts of the climate story ... ... ... ... matters to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we sort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public and\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from community minded Fenton family dealerships serving keen swans Ian olive Chester county giving back to the community for over Thirty years ... dealerships dot com\nRefers to the statistics of the weather in those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to\nThat's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens it in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every year\nYou know write that one and I think what is not necessarily what we can say that I mean why won't do echinacea or any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that that is still quite rare and is now calling and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived periods of heat heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods\nAt the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat\nYou're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I've said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream\nIn a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger in apple attitude and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high struck the jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks\nThey also put another high over Siberia with high heat that an over North America where the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California west seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nIt's getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress um the summer droughts\nAre so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires and what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season in California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California only\nSee an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the the profound challenged the climate changes already posing\nTo us\nFrom our historic emergency the largest fire forty amounts bigger than the size of Los Angeles [noise]\n\nThese are the conditions lived experience find any equipment David some fire experts at the University of California\nCompounded the tree stressing effects of long term drowned was enough rain in northern California last winter to stimulate a surge of bras gross to add an abundance of drawing on the gross which fueled firestorm\nIn some parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent\nOf normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking\nYou know this just isn't looking good and all it's going to take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem and so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but\nPretty immediately that fire was raising hairs and my husband actually went over and worked on that fire and um I I think we we're all feeling tension that we're not used to feeling around fire in California and we've had it you know the last\nTen years we've had unprecedented fires almost every every year every other year but the Carr Fire felt different\nThe Carr Fire affecting a major residential term walls in itself Turner find but the big one was the fine in Mendocino hills actually a pair of funds started on July the twenty seventh ... only finally confirmed extinguished last week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning nearer to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lakes in California\nIt was during the height of the summer so the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing to those areas is just all the right conditions for fast fire spread and extreme fire behavior and so the spiders grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in a twenty four hour period or or more maybe the the rate of growth made it very difficult for cruised to to get a handle on it and they ended up burning four hundred and ten thousand acres and I we all have heard that that's the biggest fire in California history I think that\nThe next big us was last year in Southern California at two hundred and eighty thousand acres so\nA very large area\nOf course is not just being heat waves and fires well California ... in ... and yet they have the worst monsoon funding in a hundred years

Varoufakis was in the column is known for his radical critique of the global capitalist system\nWhen he was appointed finance minister of Greece in early twenty fifty it was a time of extraordinary economic crisis in his home country Greece was saddled with the boss that's an economy in the recession and international creditors in no mood to cut the Athens government any more slack\nVaroufakis

am air pressure\nAnd Greece avoided bankruptcy and an egg many us exit from the euro three is on\nVaroufakis is still trying to persuade Greeks and the wider world\nThat the EU and the global capitalist system need radical progressive reform but right now it's the populist right rather than the radical left\nThat seems to be harnessing popular anger and threatening the status\nThe argument well yeah and as far as ... joins me now welcome to hot\nYou're still play a political role you have a new political policy which you are determined to make a force in Greece and in Europe but would you accept that as a radical as a leftist the tides in Europe the tide of popular opinion is running against you\nAbsolutely civilization is in the street\nWhere experiencing a new book smart than

someone we're losing the bottle and this is why this is a time to ... group\nAcross a broad alliance of progressive Democrats liberals have left wing goes that had civilization out the hearts\nBefore we drill down into the detail about analysis I Do want to ask you whether you think it is justifiable to\nAs so many progressive left us to use this trove about Europe today looking like Europe in the Nineteen thirties the historian Neal focusing addressed that very rich and he said this absolute known since it's so lazy because if one just takes one example lettuce Italy you just mentioned Mr solving a utopia throughout New York fascism\nThe truth is as soon as Mr solving he came to power and I spoke to him the other day on all talk\nHe actually has abandoned many of his more radical positions particularly on for example leaving the euro zone\nWhy hasn't he has the ... the place the some of the ... button for a year and we can discuss this next year about what he is permitted have done\nIs that he has used to the same story line from the Nineteen to this whole problem is saying the average ... whose income has been put a cap it the falling for Twenty years there's no doubt about that too many stories but I'd back by just opposing him\nAnd this is what we tried to do what we said to the people who are new to buy the nationalist not able to secure for this of the on the Mike and I'm not sure why don't we say to them well what we say to genuinely cannot see emotional level we had to them as we need to take our country back\nWe need to get our towns back but to get out

we we must do we've just discussing for much of this interview the problems facing the European Union because frankly of a democratic deficit west so they don't recognize legitimacy I mean you institution but hey you let me I'm Out we being some sort of a global institution that says somebody's own currency who who is this we\nLet's let me ask the question in may the size of nine to ... our movement is going to stand to the European Parliament elections and we're going to stand in Greece we're going to stand with our friends and colleagues in that in the middle of the time that they've bought if they were going to stand in Poland with a feminist to lead to\nPolitical progressive particles that are ... we're going to Iran in elections in it against elevate knee that's who we are and our challenge is how to create and not at the end of inclusiveness I knew that this completely human they stick on the nationalist and ended up not\nArchitects and you just laid out that you're going to fight in elections on as let's face it you said you're a Democrat you're going to walk the walk as well as talk talk and I respect that but if if one looks at current post\nWhy the movement has been around for a couple of years but you on news so the fact you're from scoring virtually zero in the polls will let that pass in their house you owned by the way and get a ... we'll let you know listen bankrupt lead for language and I didn't want to figure out what all\nThey want to get to is this the only country in Europe right now where\nThe law in its more radical form is actually doing well or at least gaining traction with a significant part of the population is in the United kingdom this so want me can you know the u._k. very well want in your view makes Jeremy cool Britain's Labour Party different from\nSo many of the other\nLeft movements in Europe and across the world today\nWhat Brexit has had a lot to do with it\nBecause ... has been a slap in the face of progressive independently of what their view about bricks that is what I mean I was gonna say labor party view and breakfast is extraordinarily confused so I I ... the sound fusing issue\nIf you're confused when you're facing a confusing Asia you a fanatic but given the Kobus position on bricks that remains even off the Labour Party conference unclear I Can't see how bricks it can be the driver of the momentum and under what you said it was it create ... ... and in this country\nThat British democracy\nAnd they throw in the world and not be taken for granted it means to be invented let's look at look at the the ... site this gives the people who have Britain and opportunity do what they consider their position in the world and I believe that the judge me has been doing a very good job\nAt a recognizing that the last ... years of privatization of moving towards a business model that effectively tied to the economy's gross onto bubbles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's causing a reassessment of this even with that or is\nInteresting and so you would say because you talked about last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of neo liberal economic ... you would say that Tony Blair was in no way of left of center politician would you\nWhat does it mean on the one hand he was because he gave a lot of money the national health service\nMoney that they thought he said stop the national health service off but at the very same time he\nDid it by aligning himself fully with the city of London turning a blind eye to the private money ... thing of the private banks and creating the circumstances that lead to because I was in an eight and to the collapse into ... and the night so we bought\nI'm getting too is that the John Macdonald ... the the current shadow chancellor of the sticker here in the case has made a big speech where he painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example the man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. of a need to have\nTen percent of that shit is given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of David and to be received by each worker and the access beyond that would go to the government so it would actually be a huge new corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the state and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people are going to vote for that\nI think so and I'm very glad to have hut or John Macdonald put forward there have been proposing to McDonald about the program we eras things you've been saying society proposing is precisely that\nWith one difference I've been proposing the creation of a social fund where that ... percent of the shadows after every ideal or capitalizing by corporations go into the public will fund\nAnd then the dividends are distributed to the former universal basic dividend whereas the Labour Party is leaving them up amongst the workers with any of those corporations but what I think is very important to remember this is not it's\nOf the liberal part of the confederacy of may going to the money first of all I Hope it does if he's a very interesting discussions though that we must have even thought it must have\nAbout the division between competent labor\nBut a different state when once upon a time when and that sort of spoiled the machine the machine belonged industrialist and then the investors who claimed the profits of the machine produced for the company but these days of Google and Facebook when every time you search and your Google Search engine for something you're providing capital\nTo Google and no one is getting a defense for that except for Google we have to concede that property rights over that he times with capital and live that everybody is the only party in the world that is doing this okay\nSo for you definitely you tell your labor party represents a beacon of hope but throughout this interview you've been saying we must do this we must do that and I've been pointing out that actually\nIn the real world and the world of politics and opinion polls\nYour ideas are not gaining very much traction if we leave the United kingdom so I disagree with you is\nIt is they're looking at some point say to yourself you know what democratic politics doesn't what we're going to find new ways one labor MP in what I'm saying she said ... says we need to topple the government and we can't do it at the ballot box\nWe will do it with a general strike by working with the trade unions is that you kind of policy what ... is is not illegal to last time I check on them let them illegal immigrants hunting is right now that your view when you kind of politics needs to go\nWell firstly let's be clear to because these are dangerous times with their eyes off by extremists around the world and we have to be very clear in our language and the of the way that we support democracy\nSo to answer that gay I'm going to quote from Winston Churchill\nThe Democratic process is pretty awful it's pretty nasty but it's the best of all of this and we have to be prepared to defend it with our lives I think that'd be pretty straightforward answer to your question now whether strikes of part of the political\nDemocratic process I Do believe that they are on the ... we have to end the practice I thank you very much for being on ... thank you\nYou're listening to any ... support comes from you our

business day began with a clip from young ... to us banks professor of Chinese city and regional planning\nTo begin with talking about one hundred square kilometer but then they are talking about in the next twenty or even longer term\nTo solve the square kilometer so that's really huge in terms of a geographic website it's bigger than the existing Beijing and what's going to be in it they're talking about lots of functions to be be centralized from Beijing for example\nMade okay to universities as state owned businesses some of the government to sectors and all the public services

you know we had a meeting later I can talk more\nWith that he wrote an nervously hooked into a car and vanished\nTalk of full three locations arrive in this area villages convicted from their homes phones with little or no compensation perhaps the real question is what all of this is full will China actually deliver on the dream of showing and the new green city\nProfessor ... again from the University of North Carolina\nThis is a really top down planning project in that ... that has high profile\nYou have studied over the last two or three decades all of the range of these infrastructure project caliphate yeah and there's another one isn't it a port in northern China champion by Hu Jintao or a former prime yet but it's come to nothing I mean there have been white elephants as well as success stories in China\nYeah they did was to become an ecological zero sort of emission poster child but it didn't really succeed are there are many reasons behind it\nBut the shoreline this case just keep in mind that within the next couple of years I think the government definitely has the capacity to relocate many of the state owned businesses\nTo this new area so it's a little bit different from the other big new projects in China this one is really be top down\nProfessor young so I mean that report came out a year ago nobody seemed to be happening just then since those days the government has issued more plans for the development prove that does seem to remain slow though\nIn Jersey City planner for showing the new district uh he he ... he's the city planning gee he said that they will range of environmental problems in the area including a high flooding risk and poor access to transportation this is what he's in the speech\nIf these two problems and not to be solved it would be like building a ... tip it ... me the ... the government brought up for this new town\nWell Gabriel will ... is a the Shanghai bureau chief for the Financial Times he went to the site recently this is what he so\nIt's definitely still early days for this mega project I visited when they were just completing the centerpiece of the first days the film on public service Centre and that kind of many within it city that include electric cars charging stations and\nSensors are based on that recognition twenty thousand sensors around the whole city is a future hotel that include human being free checking they planted thousands of trees around the center but beyond that public service center is still quite\nA quite barren where basically still be able to read an almond trees surrounding the central service center\nWell George magnets is still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government I'm Joe ... basically this is the point is that China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it\nSupport for an HP arts live stream comes from you our listeners and from radiation energy a local employee owned company helping thousands of granite staters go solar\nRevision energy is currently growing their team of electricians and plumbers learn more at revision energy dot com slash careers\nPoint so really what's happened in the last ten years in particular I Would say that the the Chinese government has actually relied on\nInfrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so every time they called me looks like it's looking a little bit worldly I'm you get ... to build more infrastructure intellect more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments\nAre on the other is because they they really believe this um the rhetoric about a ... and leads to you know better growth\nAnd she has a huge contentious issue because some of us believe actually the sequencing works the other way round that actually you get better urbanized ... from having good growth model or because actually if it was a simple than every would you need for growth is just build ...\n... ... a declining yields from building more things you can't go on building things forever and it wasn't always give you the same time that it did it the ...\nYes indeed I think again or you know like so many things in China to everything is so ... so if you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure ... head of population\nOf course it's still some way behind Japan\nA soul in in Asia or you know American cities and European cities\nBut um you know as little kinds that kind of famous British economist once said in the long run we're all dead and what we have to be concerned about really is about the missile allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks ... and I'm actually quite all of the problem\nAnd it can also lead a goals to huge amounts of public debt ... how big is Chinese public debt well\nUh it is about the end of two thousand and Seventeen was around three hundred and fifty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nI thought it was like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fat where the the there is any magical number at which point you know a crisis and its use but certainly the the miss allocation of resources the cumulative increase if\nDifficulties which smaller Chinese banks are facing um funding bad loans you know the way they have to raise deposits and if they can't raise them from households they are raising them from increasingly a novel a tile an uncertain short term sources and I think these things are contrived to to bring about kind of some uncertainty\nNow you've written a book called red flags I mean how much jeopardy is China or in from ... and other risks\nWell I think I'm trying to uh that isn't the only problem that China faces that it's also facing you know kind of a confluence of lots of problems aging I'm you know technology um currency stability and so on the difference that I think uh the last few years of made is that\n... governance system has changed China or Iran is now I'm not
