Afghans away from polling stations nonetheless millions didn't turn out on results will be declared next month\nThe government of president Ashraf Ghani is likely to hail approaches as evidence of progress on the road to stability\nBut beyond the rhetoric want as reality look like the Taliban operate with impunity in waves of territory the national security forces are short on numbers and morale corruption as well as the insurgency undermined the authority of the state\nWell my guest is President Ghani has recently appointed national security advisor how do you fully Afghanistan's ambassador in the U.S a technocrat\nWith little previous security experience is the Afghan government really in a position to shape the future of the country well how does it\nI'm On the line from Kabul welcome to talk to Steven good to be here\nWe speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you a shame that the\nWay those elections work cloud with so many Afghans\nAre facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and the lack of government control of key parts of your territory like Bruce Lee ... everything that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban are and there is precedents of attacks on polling stations\nThe African people defied all of that in came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the Afghan people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the end DSS\nUh I think they did\nA tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community\nAh we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those\nThree or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not belittle that bravery for one second but here's the reality your own electoral commission and\nSay that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country didn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar\nAnd the guy's name a that was no voting because of security concerns of course that may be some more voting next week we're not quite sure we know that your own a transparent election foundation and the country found that the biometric systems were not working and many of the polling stations which were open\nBecause I knew was one of the reasons I accepted into this job it hurt me personally as an African to know that we failed our security forces from a policy standpoint and I'm dedicated me and the and the national Security Council will be working to resolve all of those issues\nI issued a statement our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies and ... that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful of mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people are in the way in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the name so exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan\nHave been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life I Know gains because our country is not secure he said that of NATO's operations and of course\nThe operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from nighttime forces all from your own Afghan forces unfold watch\nBecause this is the more you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't this is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives\nAnd protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on ah on colleagues from previous government um they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that\nThis is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from a TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there's only so much news\nA space for one son and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is a transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially I'm I ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country ah grew up in the war\nOr our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies or to help us along the way\nThey know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yeah that's where a war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end and it takes\nThen just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures everyday and thanks for a reason to support or been helping and equipment and training our security is to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time with somebody so let me ask you some quick questions a pivoting toward you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particularly the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing the U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently to Eric Britain's formerly the head of Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action\nHow would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contract to enforce\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's\nAnd why is that on my ...\nHe had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire wet\nWell I'll tell you and your story because we knew that I don't think it'll take me a straight on said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving\nEfforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote ...\nI had these meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government\nHeard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one can formation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report\nThat just because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ... you didn't know he has to be very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't want to be clear then you I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past when the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now\nOh we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident uh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are are in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do bone and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan\nAnd it would be a shame that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste I'm are asked by a ... through a process where I don't that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right towards stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see he wet weather the African people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in in a democratic process and let the Afghan people choose\nHandler my we have to end it there but I Do thank you very much for joining me on how talk\nYou're listening to an HP are where support comes from you our listeners and from the elm street ...

in Michigan until it closed during the recession like somebody like losing your life you know now with unemployment near record lows what does the recovery look to them\nWas in decades of conflict ... murders and bones and people were fair to just the troubles which doesn't seem adequate enough to me it's part of the good friday agreement the British Army would have been on the streets of Northern Ireland there would've been checks on roads and people being stopped in their cars and\nI'm with a peace day lot fell away\nAnd essentially for the last Twenty years we've enjoyed what everybody refers to as an invisible border so people can come and go without any restriction Reno without having to show documents that the idea that you might go back to there being any sort of state presence or a military presence or anything like that\nAlong the border of deep concern to people\nPeople took the risk of violence returning if there is a will to we established between the Irish republican all of the night and it's a real\nThreat I think that it is you know when people talk about a return to the troubles I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think about the hard border would introduce would range all the way from street protests and maybe civil disobedience\nTo physical violence from small group so I guess in a Republicans on what our most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton said is that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are car and I did that work would become a target\nThan it's the police Judy to defend people who are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so the play service here how serious concerns about ... a new day hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view it's\nAll that people in all the non and too I Would actually like to see the ball to come back\nWell everybody says you know political parties in Northern Ireland devote persuasion is old say that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border because\nUnionism view is that north and on and can be treated any differently to the rest of the case was in the future if there was any trade deals that the northern I wouldn't be excluded from that\nWhereas the majority of the party's view the boxed off as sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders over the last few days and they said to me you know we've called her head in her hands because we're being offered this opportunity to have this sort of best of both worlds arrangement on it's not being accepted\nHow much of a discussion topic is for people on the day to day basis and what you are and ... something that you know most people are talking about a lot of the time it's something that is\nMore practice that has done is put the issue of the constitutional position\nHigh up onto the agenda where maybe it hadn't pain in the past the ... the constitutional position whereas NIH with Brecht said people here are talking about the Irish unity in a way that wasn't on the agenda beforehand\nSo it's interesting that union is feeding the practice it will strengthen northern Ireland's union with Britain whereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually have it and to fight as one of the British union aside if things are now starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of circumstances I certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every\nTV show every talk show every pulling all of these questions Milwaukee one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel like\nThe idea of Irish unity were in the middle of this big storm and everybody's looking at us not least because we're going to be the border between you and the u._k. but also in the context of the pie propping up Theresa May's government and have enough control at Westminster where\nTheir views have to be considered seriously by the British Government in a way that they've never had to do before\nThat was freelance journalist Amanda focus and talking to my colleague ... ... you're listening to business daily and today we're exploring the issue that could and Britain's Brexit negotiations\nThe Irish border odds history of division explains why the ... has become such a sticking point for the Brexit negotiations that's been old to a parent\nIn the British Parliament this week wet pro breakfast and piece from the British prime minister his own party have been threatening to try and ... that has been lurid talk of a political assassination of ... with Theresa May ... anonymous sources have cold the killings on\nShe survived so far but the border issue remains so how might ... be resolved if indeed it ever is I'm joined by all UK politics correspondent robots and\nNow it's been a tough week for Teresa maybe you could see it outside our most ... how she felt this way\nYou're absolutely right you could say that most weeks and I think there's ... on one level she has some good some bad days in some suffering ... relationship with her I can only describe it as a ... divided conservative policy\nBut I think what doesn't change is the big picture which really does look rather grim and challenging for her and that is how long enough to she got to do about Britain's withdrawal and future relationship with Europe\nThat somehow satisfies yes that fee brawl divides conservative policy which doesn't want any businesses and the ... which doesn't put ... on and and and and that was enough\nWhich satisfies the you twenty seven\nSo Rob you've laid out a complex set of conditions that needs to be filled that all the different policies that needs to be satisfied but I actually the parameters of that is a fairly clear on because Europe has kind of pretty much light down you know what it needs to see has meant the\nEar absolutely right I think in many ways that's why we are in the horrible fix that but we are in that if you like there's a contradiction in the ... projects and ... you is prepared to offer I mean if we're really going to strip it back to basics just send them if you\nIf you think about it what what was what was leave all the violence it was taking back and I quote control of bulldoze all ... ... ... a well it's quite tricky to figure out how you do that and have friction let's trade with the European Union and not have a cold or an off and on and unless of course\nThe European Union was to say guess what you can\nYou kind of something special we will recognize British rules and regulations as in hot equivalent ... and that is why we are in the fix that we're in the basically Britain has been saying we'd like everything that we used to like about him being members of a you none of the things that we didn't like and that he was saying was she gotta be kidding\nSo what we're seeing is the ... middle of a negotiation about how much did they say is brinkmanship how much of that is both sides\nKind of holding out for the best deal they can possibly get how much compromise can you do you think it's possible within the positions of the tree policy\nI think some of it as
