London film festival it's called a ... a while it's set in the heart of the Sudanese civil war it's actually a love story and the comedy of the direct to she was ... came into the studio a to speak to this program ... ... ...\n... is this um comedy I'll be humorous comedy though is ... shot in a war zone\nAnd so he tells us about this soldier who in the off season and it's really weird to say there's an off season to war but in the Sudanese civil war in the rainy season the tanks and cars can move because it the mud and it gets ... and the fighting stops and in that period\nOur main character is this guy who is off for a couple of months in the off season\nAnd I'm at the kitchen has happened in the ... round up so basically the army the rebel army wants to round up everybody 'cause it's dry again and in twenty four hours they have to run capture all the soldiers who are like running around in our main actor is this guy who\nIs running around being a use he falls in love and yet he's with his government any causes some issues and now he has to solve all problems within twenty four hours\nThe funniest film you'd have to say about a Sudanese civil war the Sudanese slacker movie ever you're pushing these films in it they just filled with a different direction to another of Sudanese films\nA big part of me and making this film was the Sudanese image like what is it to be ... and\nThere's this box that people want to put us in and it's because of who we are in their slamming government and all that and I want it to break it and I wanted to create something that's more Sudanese like a Sudanese person would experience in the street or whatever and this to me\nWas created by I I used to have this small little book and every incident that happened that was found in front of me I Would write it down and I created a story that's very nice very things that people will be like this is what we normally do\nIt quite a difficult thing is meant to make a comedy about a war zone I mean that's a typical ground to walk along\nSide shot at and in New ... so he was in a civil war and there were so basically in two thousand sixteen in July the Sudanese government was bombing so I was like running around documenting the bombing and being bombed dads and all that matters are all being bombed that and then in July ends\nIn less than ... when the um the characters are soldiers are lying down on the ground and the you know there's a plate of ahead there's a boom lots that's real life\nThat's real life that documentary and the plane flying that's actually the real Sudanese fighter jets bombed to add to that that Israel and but then the rest of the films fictional\nSo in that reality in that war zone you are making a documentary about before you might just this fiction film will you laughing alone I mean was that comedy in your everyday war zone or just in the film\nSo what happened was when I made the documentary and then we ... we started having this ... a cinema thing so we go around and the different villages and will show the film all these different films and the whole village comes out like\nFour hundred people a thousand five hundred people and they would be like celebrating because they are coming out and they want to watch cinema and they start laughing at the smallest little thing and some stuff is like this is a serious film and yes there's that little part but people are really excited\nSo from that excitement we decided that what people really want to see is something exciting and comedy and laugh and get them to get together and be happy so that's why we started creating for a short films and then this film came about\nShe talked about wanting to change the image of sue them what do you want to show\nI wanted to create an image that of people who are living life and they're happy in their normal lives\nEven if that no more life as it was\nEven at the ... it gets interrupted by war all the time\nShe was ... the director of the films just being scream in London a cash or he was speaking to James ... about it on the challenges involved and telling that story this is being used by throwing some trauma bike again

I'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist rude it's time to hold back into survival mode do this dumpster fire and live by a bore\nFeminist agenda and [laughter] I mean I could ... plenty\nOf people who actually uh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group this um respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals\nWho are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who hum is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of a white women is not surprising I'm often frustrated by that as well\nIn fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr Blasey Ford there's um foreign\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean that patriarchy isn't working through it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I don't mind described as a problem\nI I get I get the intersect the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common cause ... can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be with us on a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way you do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads\nAmongst those groups if we call the groups or many of\nUs are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was\nA multiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences\nI think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing suggest that many women are particularly those that fifty three percent that in that in fact voted for Trump\nMay be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the President's Day how do you feel about ... about because he's with the midterms coming up his regions of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this ...\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and oh gee beat the Americans that is all known since I he said I go\nVotes from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to\nListen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect bronco bottom of actually walking rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWell I think it's tough for president to actually change the structures of American politics\nUm I have my disagreements a with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric\nUm that identifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nI had took issue with him for example uh on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but in excluded women and girls but that was a minor I'm sort of a difference of within a broader reality\nWe are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he tried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes\nWas able to win those districts in Pennsylvania I'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections that what we're in an election season and the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition it is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nOr the ... democratic votes as you said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the cultural liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale whites\nWith the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says that\nAgain in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and ... group based politics is he's a very complex a complex set of relationships and the attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I don't I make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that game the vote that the victory to Roy Moore\nA when a U.S senator who was the first a Democrat or to the elected from Alabama and a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges\nHow can we not only use black women as the whales and the best but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them if we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to speak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political mobile mobilize\nA coalition that is what we're looking for in this in this midterm election well see\nWe will indeed so you can really Crenshaw thank you very much for joining me now to\n\nOffering e books store events and hours on

has any ... inspired you to learn more about your stage and your world so to wear your legacy gift inspire future generations email me\nWe've created this crazy system where every time you use it you leave data about yourself and what your activities are for anybody else to harvest and that's just not right\nThat is Larry ... founding director of the California Institute for telecommunications in information technology and one of the architects of the first prototype networks the ... says to the ... Web created back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet's very structure that grows ... original design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today and when there was many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data\nAnd in particular data about you I mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily\nPanic about assault someone else's harvesting that data and particularly if they're getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nThat they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the ... it was this architectural weakness well you're\nSeeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about you that you generate in your hands period you have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you\nYou may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants that our government wants that we're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential\nAs Tim burners Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it or to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have is\nThe most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens like your\nUsed to harvesting model at Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out his his his now kind of ... being posted\nThat's absolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you\nRelative to other humans but right now you're in danger if you share your data\nFrom insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things so it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data\nBecause they're not afraid that there will be things that happen to them that are bad in their future so I think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I think the scale of the uh catastrophes that are happening on the net including the very attacks\nOn the foundation of our democracy have open people up\nInternet pioneer and would be reform a very small now of course you know it isn't just about identity theft and data harvesting there is another problem some reckon demonstrated by the emergence of so called information warfare fake news\nService Anderson is the founder of scout hey oh it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the bolts manipulating the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially at Twitter date in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy\nOr a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots you know I did a quick search this morning and found one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent box but generally the\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or to visit comments on line is that there is a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left\nAnd the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and heart in ... by their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIt's extraordinary isn't it I mean you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook these platforms into a physical community\nWe'd be standing in a crowd of people\nSeventy percent which would be machines\nYou know it'd be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world\nKind of like living in the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I I just people presumably didn't understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator that they were having that conversation and I'm telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other at least they think\nWell yeah I mean when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people respond to these people or thoughts or algorithms whatever they might be and they'll retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging\nYou create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and the normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story\nAnd it's all essentially been architect did by a group of fake accounts\nOn social media can you say the mainstream news meter was complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out there and take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company\nBut it has and you'll have not yet buried under the new suggests a variety of ... to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block chain to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the reliability pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all of those notes are connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decentralized the time because no children and it it it's\nThe centralized but it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture the social social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic so this is going to ... that we have a way through because ultimately we will go live with the Internet is not going to go away because on invented\nCan we I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we've outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do\nWhat it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I'm absolutely optimistic about it\nAn optimistic berets and dissident who like Larry small sees the beginnings of change but neither of them expected to happen quickly it's not\nJust technology it's going to require major international country by country regulation a legal changes\nIt's a bill of rights there's nothing more fundamental and it's going to take years if not decades to move in that direction but the solutions are beginning to be on the horizon\nInternet pioneer Larry small I guess we should stress that this is just one vision a point of view that he's putting food there will be many no doubt from Internet firms and elsewhere who disagree over the design fools he's describing but whatever size you settle the debate about the future of the net is vulnerabilities", "show_name": "BBC World Service",
