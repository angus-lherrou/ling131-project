Schneider is a visiting professor of law at Fordham Law school in New York he\nJust had a book published consenting presidential powers and the limits of the constitution entitles the oath and the office\nSaturday nights of President Trump's recent comment about doped to foods testimony is he surprised how vigorously President Trump has subsequent he defended by Kevin ...\nYes I thought it completely contradicted both what he said and what those of us who watched her testify saw which was a obviously credible witness who didn't look like she had any sort of partisan agenda but it was just relating what had happened to her\nAnd so it's a you know suspicious and say the least that he's changed course like this I think he's feeling empowered\nOr he also doesn't like opposition and what our system of government in the United states is about is the notion that the Senate confirmation hearing has an equal co equal role to the president in deciding whether to confirm Supreme Court justice\nBut this is a president who doesn't know much care much about constitutional government and a sees himself as an authoritarian leader and so I think although this contradicts what he said earlier about ... credibility it's consistent with his consistent opposition to the rule of law and the idea of constitutional government\nWhy do you think he invested so much in getting Brett Kavanaugh ... despite the political cost the parent political cost of that because that must be a hundred judges in America who hold very similar views [noise] ah\nOne suspicion is that because Brett Kavanaugh has spoken so much about executive power including his skepticism of a case USB Nixon which is one of the most important cases are limiting a presidential power or that a president who's seeking to stop the investigation against him\nOr into grand dies his own power especially when it comes to a special prosecutor looking into possible wrongdoing\nI think he was a one of the things he found attractive about this particular nominee as opposed to others as his record on that issue that President Trump clearly cares a lot about [noise] I also think that he wants to victory period and so the idea of backing down is inconsistent with the way\nThat this president's he's themselves or as as a able to kind of defeat opponents not deliberating I'm not seeing himself as a co equal partner\nOr but really is not just a leader but a a kind of authoritarian character dictating what the country should do\nWhat sort of impact do you think this is going to have on those November midterms that being some suggestions that women across the nation is so outraged by this that it could have a very negative effect on on on President Trump and his party's chances\nAnd you remember back in March Facebook was going through the Cambridge Analytica scandal where they had this ... has used third party apps\nTo scrape data from Facebook users and it was a massive\nIntrusion into the personal ... or ... uses around about the same time Google thought well maybe that was going to happen to them so they assessed that road systems on Google Plus to save such a a a similar way to get ... would have been possible on Google process and they found out\nA sure enough that it was possible and Google Plus now the difference here of course\nIs that Google found this out they decided\nThat probably most serious enough to to share this with anybody you know its uses or regulators\nAnd so it wasn't until this report from the wall Street Journal on Monday that we've heard anything about this asshole I'm now Google say yes we did find that\nWe didn't think it was serious enough however we are going to shut down Google Plus which seems like a dramatic mood but that was very few people using it in the first place so this is kind of almost pushing Google Plus out of its misery because he was always something of a something of a dead network walking is the phrase I think would fit nicely\nOnes is comparable to a ... a kind of data access to bridge\nThese kind of circumstances of what was possible ... exactly the same ... the the only real difference between the two is that Facebook you know he's the biggest social network in the world with two and a half billion\nUsers Google Plus\nBelly hides well but they said the number affected by this breach was half a million of issues is this and that may have been the entirety of the side because they said how popular Google Plus days ah many people suspect that that low Dumbo wasn't because it was\nThere because the fact was minimal I just because they say if it wasn't that many people using Google process about quantity of uses rather than\nA any any difference between the two two potential breaches\nI Wonder what this all means for pizza protection um especially with with all these questions are rising about where the these it means to regulate the facebooks and Google's of this world a bit more\nYes ...

origins meaning of cool I'm Bridget Kendall\nThe idea of cool has been ... and music ... tree and praise fashion and films the other side of its way into many different languages it's something that millions of people across the world is spot you and today it's practically a commodity a way to help sell products\nBut what exactly is who and why did it come from\nSome even argue that it's impossible to define though I suspect that my three guests today we'll try to convince you otherwise joining me from the United states is Joe ... a cultural historian a chilling University in New Orleans and author of the origins of cruel in postwar America\nIn Massachusetts is Claudia Springer professor of English in film studies at frowning and State University here eight James Dean trying to get the many faces of rebel iconography\nAnd we'd be in the studio is the writer and courageous Carol ... professor the Chelsea College of arts in London who started the concept of cruel and how to documents sixteen book the birth of cruel style narratives of the African diaspora welcome to all three of you have to start with I Want to ask each of you in time that you could just pick\nOne example of who watch is the perfect example of cool for you personally and why do\nI don't like to choose an epitome of cool because of the concept changes every generation a little bit but since it started out as a set of strategies to defy racism I Will choose Mohammed Ali the heavyweight boxer and Ali although universally admired now a mostly white Americans hated Ali when he took them does\nSo he grew up watching musicians which was Miles Davis but he knew that cool had to change into something more confrontational and so she didn't fight in the Vietnam War and he went to prison for three years at the prime of his career forfeiting probably ten million dollars and earnings\nAnd he famously said about Vietnam I'm not going to fight white people sending black people to fight yellow people to protect the country they stole from the red people so he was an activist even though Americans thought he was in fact sort of not keeping his place as an African American could yeah what about you\nI'm going to name two people prince and David Bali ... cool they had called styles and they made cool music they were both somewhat mysterious and unknowable and they continue to define cool even after the deaths in twenty six team\nWell Miles Davis was an African American trumpeter and band leader and became iconic in terms of how we changed jazz music\nMiles Davis said that he wanted it to be kind of music that people could actually listened to him follow and even on Tuesday is much cooler rather than hop music if you like\nAnd then he terms of his um style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style\nAnd this meant um jackets and yes small jacket and tie and things like that he would buy\nFrom shops on university campuses in the United states when it's bound with play citizen I'm an album called the museums of miles and\nSo it's very unusual he was Nineteen fifty five [noise] he's in a um says look a jacket beautiful pale colored ... a no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling you still working directly into the camera\nAnd for me he's saying I'm black that far I Am deal with it\nSo he's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style of young white men are too expensive universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself exactly it's not just for one group it can be for me I'm like why was\nThat this emphasis on style on the on this looking good visual pose what we're talking about public stick his head but more generally in sexual terms or could you say something about your family you have this relates to use\nSo when they came over from Jamaica to England in the Nineteen fifties the way we still British colonial subjects posed was important to them\nTo stretch this idea of visibility a sense of pride making allies to themselves in Britain despite over in spite of the racism the ... system that was rising in Britain the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties so there was this\nContinuous actually feel like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nSo up to this point we've defined coolest largely an African American ... something that was developed by jazz musicians as a result of being on the outside of not belonging being the other but well John's was at the height of its popularity the idea of crew was manifesting itself in other ways like for example on the silver screen\nSummer Nineteen forty one I Can't find one time and they are [noise]\nKnow about their sleep and they are\nAll over America\n\nAll in June joined smaller towns and all the world\nAnd walks in a mine [noise]\nHumphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine on duty Wilson asylum

film wrong how does filmed while relate to cool\nWell film water protecting us are disillusioned I'm cynical the owners who often get embroiled in criminal activities [noise] this type of terse on ruffled male character was influenced by a hard boiled detective fiction [noise]\nIn the shadow we knew our world the male protecting us just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd why do you think there's this idea these heroes these coups here is that resonated with the audience\n[noise] I think on the surface ah America was celebrating its victory over fascism in World War two there was an economic boom happening in this country following the war I'm On the surface\nThere was a real sense of optimism and hope for the future so for film the wire to ah refused that to reject optimism was a resounding way of saying no to official culture and it did appeal to anybody who felt tomorrow\nUh there were many films that glorify the United states that were very cheerful and optimistic but film in the war was not this was a John or that was steeped in gloomy and cynicism and disillusionment\nAnd Joe you said that the cooler peeled if this film law is linked to the post war popularity in front says ... says like oh about ... ... can you briefly explain why\nIn a way that is a wonderful historical concurrence\nOr Albert camera writes a book called the rebel a study of mad and revolt in Nineteen fifty one\nAnd it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy\nAnd my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool\nIs he says that a rebel therefore we exist\nAnd what he meant by that is if you're a rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nAnd the same is true with someone like Humphrey Bogart a Robert mentioned they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model\nFor fighting society fighting more dominant self congratulatory as a quality said\nAmericans sort of patriotism and so it is not an accident that historically all of this happens at the same time there is an overwhelming need for a new definition of what a dignity for an individual person means in a global culture when the question is how do you matter\n[noise] we've been talking about jobs have been talking about film we've been talking about this philosophical approach to cool that seems to much concurrently for different reasons and in different sections of society and different countries [noise] the thing that strikes me is that all these cones of coups seemed to be men where are the women can't women be cool to Carol\nYes they can I mentioned earlier the holiday as um my example of the ... to me it's cool Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she is being seen as a female down to east so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity an expresses that in all aspects of their lives and used his clothes and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of identity and that means for them\n[noise] okay so that's a a female coup like Conan jobs today what about you and Phil new ah [noise]\nAh in film and why are women were often cooler than men and women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly\nUm they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male factory jobs such as welding during World War two\nThe film and the wife I'm fatality is depicted as dangerous evil ... seen mostly in dark shadows at night\n[noise] okay so what do you think about this idea that maybe the weather that comes with who seem to be mostly men\nOr if you're talking about jazz musicians are Fillmore actors this notion of being sort of a rebel loner\nThat tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art and style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile\nFirst time I saw a woman referred to a school in a headline or as a description of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the band sonic youth from the eighties\nSince twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women who are merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith Deborah Harry Chrissie Hi and\nAnd uh so I'm just saying that of course there have always been called women but the term cool has never really been associated them until recently the newest rebel persona I especially in music for example are all women and so to some extent\nEffect concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell in a moment we will be taking a closer look at

charts on the rhythm and blues charts he was doing something somewhat a rich you know\nWith the African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he was often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American peers at the time also enjoyed his singing and his take on NASCAR contrition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage\nAnd he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time\nSo we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impact to people like James Dean and Elvis Presley and popular culture has of course being huge and it's transmitted is such an idea of crude across the globe but I Wonder what you will see in Kobe really choking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe no\nIt's sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line of global poll among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named were I kinds we actually consider cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that cool is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed to capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America close your what's your view\nOf the American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music and Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nBut cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures\nAdolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebels style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and oppression persistent both in the former colonies and then the former colonial powers\nThere is I found that to ... post colonial rebels um the French films lot hand from

bear is of African descent ... of Arab descent and Vince is Jewish one of their friends has been shot by police\nAnd they adopt a cool detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture but they discovered it doesn't protect them\nKind of what you think about besides your crews cultural imperialism\nFor me not just about the kind of a tough thing down if you like but it was that what ... been saying is that making use if those references to create something new and to say something new about their own experiences in particular a particular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this parade ground away one started the cruelest being taken by another generation and turned it into it saying\nI'm not as we've been hearing coup hasn't remained static concept job today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that cool which seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream of conformity that we've been talking about so when's cool today\nThere's conformity cool marketing cool and there's rebel cool and the marketing cool is the kind that people promote products and make it seem like you're a rebel if you have one or you'll be popular any of those things and then there's the grass roots rebel cool in which\nPeople and laid out adolescence choose icons that they admire that are rebels that they in a sense vicariously live through or lead them to their own path\nSo I Would say in terms of marketing cool cool is a rebel sensibility for consumer culture and that's ironic right so you don't want to conform so you pretend you're a rebel even though you're conforming but for me the rebel cool part the part that still vital alive\nI Would define rebel cool simply dissuade cool is how we go she ate maternity in late adolescence to icons of popular culture between like the age of Seventeen and twenty five and we're

World Service on Google show if you are fed up with people in your airwaves the only seem to talk about problems but never solutions\nThan we are the chauffeur you every week we like to introduce you to strong willed people who don't just criticize the status quo they plan to change it and they are putting it into action this week we're talking about water access to safe drinking water in slums\nThe informal dwellings often housing hundreds of thousands of people that crop up around big cities in the developing world\nThe un estimates more than eight hundred million people live in slums worldwide\nThe huge numbers of them getting clean drinking water is a major problem often the basic infrastructure just doesn't exist typhoid in color are common as the water that does make it and is often contaminated as you just heard some due to you've been reporting\nOn this story yet I paid a visit to Nairobi in Kenya\nWhere according to census data less than ... people living in the city have access to clean pipe tool to less than half yeah I Know and it's a particular problem in places like Kibera on the edge of the city\nIs one of the oldest and largest slums in Africa\nAnd nobody really knows how many people live set some estimates put the cigarette around ... million and do it is an incredible place [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nIs titled mess of makeshift houses sunshine against narrowed down the road east coast which has shown next week shelf next to welders shops and there's no privacy your neighbors music music to [noise]\nAren't they set up specifically to stop people like Kenny coming in and under costing them how's he managed to keep them at bay yeah they are they all dangerous state will use violence if necessary and that's happened I guess you really have to know more about Kenny and where he's from to understand is tricky relationship\nOr we sat down on the roof of shelf that H cute it's one of the few solid brick buildings in a slum looking out onto this view of his old neighborhood [noise]\nI grew up in a better\nFuture for a tough life they went through I Lived in poverty I fixed gun violence was abused by people in the street\nWe were very\nTools I really really tough place\nKenny isn't exaggerating when he said it was tough I just ten years old he ran away from home\nBecause of it there's no food in the house for me to a very very poor what did you do it with somebody by grabbing things from people and the girl seldom Lucy was caught box somewhere we comment\nTypically beat up and you often get bitten by the police had on the streets we use the drugs I usually petroleum glue or the ... of the the clinic knee high so that I can forget about my [noise] my pain\nBut then at age fourteen afterlife of poverty and petty crime everything changed after he was befriended by Catholic priests in the neighborhood he started going to school and reading books\nBoth Marcus Garvey about two missiles Mandela Rosa Parks\nAnd they became my mentor that I never met I used to talk to them over the ...\nSo in two thousand and four Kenny created shelf go and they started pretty small actually as a football team but it grew and grew he married an American volunteers who came to work on the project which now includes a school for girls a youth mentoring scheme and health clinic and it was the clinic that inspired that focus on water\nWe used to tell people we thought that when you see in our clinic [noise]\nSome people get cholera some people get typhoid sweet adequately reaching some guys what do we do\nSomeone at the committee had a suggestion\nAn idea given that you know what\nOf the ridge and fight on the guy on\n[laughter] ... [laughter]\nI don't know where the topic will be clean no see which\nWhen it's lumping you see that what is ...\nAnd I'm like wow this is a good idea this idea we just want somebody who knew somebody to commute you we just sat there and you're like wow and you gotta let me think about what let's get the pie in the end is as good\nSo what about the cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that territory in a big way\nAnd that's where Kenny experience in states is in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWe're we the people that might be affecting them criticizing now have you had any interaction with them yes Adam\n... they started cutting you'll pipe yes so that was really terrible so what I did for several of them would really be on to their wife or their children to be the ones that didn't want to you know a kiosk ... income that's why we're able to survive\nThen there's that ... by there is that some times that they send their water we don't stand mostly on the weekends we don't do send water for that day they sat down there this is Kenny\nOld over he hasn't run in with the cartels but instead of ending up in a battle he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nWith that for ... and they said for ten\nSo you will say it's clean it's clean cheaper and cheap\nCompared to what they must be worried about your expansion fence yeah\nYeah so I I Will find a way to work with them were to find a way without too you know within the system so that's what you went back to [noise]\n\n\n\nJust listening to Kenny how his life story the sun makes me realize that he really is the key to this\nSolution here and we sell always ... program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions happen and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he street smart he's slum ... if you'd like he knows how to operate the\nYeah I didn't want to paint shelf guy as a one man band you know Kenny just off on his own doing this in Kibera it's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that call school like I mentioned and the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife\nAnd for all that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year\nAnd his wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit less stores a lot of money the ... yeah I put all of that just shelf go\nThey said the salaries in line with organizations if a similar size or everything's been signed off by the bull so okay in for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment well they're bringing in a lot of money shelf though just want to two million dollar prize from the Hilton foundation hotels ... yet the guys behind the hotels\nAnd that will help with older the what the shelf that does not just the water but there are other projects to ... the only ones who are trying to solve this problem ... not the only game in town\nThere were lots of different people and ... thinking about how to live a wolf to into slums\nAnd just in Kibera a you know the ... to ... and I'm thinking one woman she said and Wonder Woman with ... she was a ... a few years back if you remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that are also dreading bullet holes that pumping oil syrup right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just boxing it up and passing it out so they got the walk through the same way but different methods of delivery yeah exactly\nAnd the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime but then illegally at night so it's a complicated picture\n... different players involved as you said it's how to surf co fits into the\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this ... whole system I actually be quite limited because at the amount of water you can produce this way and he said ultimately the real solution was working with governments and private utility companies to convince them that you could\nPiped infrastructure in Islam itself so that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes but Congress and\nPeople are shocked Cohen Kenya a bit more fleet to circle you know fast to doing things on the ground they know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf cut their grass roots organization led by the parents spoke you baron's\nThey didn't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental it's been but he said he had invisible Mentos\n... about the ... the Rosa Parks this is how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people in Kibera\nThese men and women just\nSit down and watch what\nAnd what they did they organized people to form their own life they didn't see ... and now that's a puzzle beyond just before that we are yeah come together [noise] you know\n\n[noise] [noise] thank you for that recording I'm thank you well tax listeners for well listening we hope you can cheat in again next week when will introduce you to another problem solver from another part of the planet [noise]\nAnd if you suddenly realize the waste a minute you know a problem so but you should be on our radar sharing their endeavor on this program than do send us an email the address is as always world packs a BBC code the u._k. we love to hear your suggestions [noise]\nAlso do teach in on our Facebook page cold we'll ... we'll we'll posted video of Chinese aerial piping project and videos of course of all the other stories we do as well until then take care and goodbye [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're

roasted for friends\nAnd from watching\nSeals and telling me the ... sisters living in Dover\nMore information on geriatrics with a sense of humor at telling me the ... dot com [noise]\nA lot goes on in the world while you're at work and do you might catch a passion gland headline on social media between meetings you rely on all things considered for a\nIt's not political it is about creating equity in the sciences it's about all of the collective inequities that women face and that can be from having someone tell you you're a girl so you're not any good at math or are you sure you should be in this class are smart enough to be here\nPretty early on through high school and maybe in your early college years once you get into grad school not only are people questioning whether or not you should be there\nAnd your intelligence at if you weren't degree has been good enough but then they start to question your leadership skills and whether you can be in charge of students or projects\nAs you move farther into your career there\nPaid discrepancies and we started originally just wanting to support front and signatures as a ... we had a pledge and we have that on line still you can read it it's quite nice tell us what the pledges it is an open letter that\nWe wrote as the women in science asking scientists women and supporters of women scientists to stand together and change the face of science as it is today\nWe have signatures on a pledge from over one hundred countries so we have over twenty thousand people who signed a pledge\nAnd why would you hope to take this we hope\nTo be fully funded sustainable organization that continue to push\nTo make science open at Christmas and accessible we're called five hundred women scientists do at five in our women scientists within America are succeeding that we want to make five hundred women scientists within all the countries of the world and then five hundred women scientists within each discipline that are profiting from Mr Right we can keep moving up and up\nKelly Ramirez than what Kelly and talk to just wait say suggest as a structural problem with science in academia\nBut within the rules are just not as visible last week professor Dona strict and became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize for physics a day later another one from says on old won the Nobel Prize in chemistry\nAnd despite professor strict in historic achievement her biography was conspicuously absent from the world's fifth most popular website we keep ... apparently she wasn't well known enough so what's going on\nRebecca hey get is a ... in history of science at the University of Kent she says to understand you have to look at the historical role of women working in science\nIt's about how science developed and how it's find a space within the culture and within society so when you get science developing sort of the new philosophy it was it was it was understood and the seventeenth century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of SARS he wasn't necessarily particularly well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to call them easily to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing is I'm Sorry to say I'm One of the way\nExclude women because women was seen as perhaps being more dangerous or less serious or a less intelligent because of the way that gender roles have being constructed so we sometimes find women systematically being excluded why they may want to hunt and don't pay anything\nBecause that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding women lead to more authority absolutely\nAnd particularly when she got to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public space so women not generally less active in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so\nThat as a muscular and kind of ... is going on and on owning a living and so and so when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments we were talking\nLate Nineteen century before ... when you said professional what you mean um it said something way there is a uh Korea policy can fall I say a a kind of a joke that you could name for whether it's training whether all existing sought to society's channels you can publish and\nAnd I reached by what she can expect to earn a living so that's something that really doesn't exist until quite tone\nAnd by that point women very much being excluded from those of cheating in historical examples\nIf we look for who is actually paid to do science in the Eighteenth century there's very few places like that happens so they're all it's averaging granted she's one of those places where you might living by doing scientific work\nIn the nineteenth century you might find it within the navy for example doing surveying what or in geology so doing a geological surveys which becomes interesting for\nYou know finding minds exploiting resources and not kind of thing but you know finding people doing scientific research within universities for example so yeah it's really only make sure on that you get the kinds of scientific Korea that we would understand that if someone says she paid to do ... particular problem\nIs is pretty much across the ... the case or is it or are you talking specifically about Europe I'm ... I'm very much talking about the\nWestern European tradition and so what do I get sort of taken up in in America older I'm interested in either all moral position and she's a woman in what is a very new university system in say the nineteenth century so we do find for example\nMurray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach a strong to be in the women's college so what was that in the U.S in the in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a ... system\nAnd often novelty gifts brings a women I mean partly often it's a sort of reforming wild and that includes the idea that that women should be educated and have a more public voice perhaps\nSo we do find women there and the way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in Britain you've got to look for the Cambridge in England and and women's struggling for very long time to be given places\nAnd see the thing that you say that when a field is new\nAnd it coincides with to develop them until ... women and an education then you do see more women entering those field I think it's interesting that in when you look at the desk and I think is on women in science for example the some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela\nThose kinda places where the the lowest ones are the Netherlands surprisingly enough I'd love\nMore about the ... and what kind of rolls and you know are we talking about private companies doing such or are we talking about university systems\nYou know what is the kind of funding that goes into research within universities and there's different countries so in some cases I\nSuspect there may be longer focusing on women being in higher education and so on but in other cases it may be that it's a system that's not terribly well funded and whether a places that aren't very well funded or not seen as being particularly socially prestigious then you tend to find\nWomen finding an opportunity because men are not taking the option to because there are other things that they would rather be doing and certainly we\nAre a field is no full so there are good examples in the ... century of geology or in the late ... century of astrophysics so and you kind of way of doing astronomy\nWomen over from being quite early pioneers in those areas because they haven't necessarily be competing they own\nFollowing the traditional education system they own competing with a lot of established individuals' usually male to publishing in those areas and some interesting late we sometimes find that that gives women an opportunity until then often just start paying that then push that so far a\nTypical an iconic ... computer programming which early on was very much seen as a female\nRole we sort of associated with lots of ... old punch cards and things that were often seen as almost secretarial work and I'm In a very liberal very new roles so you know it wasn't necessarily well paid and often it was left to women to do this work but when it was understood to just tell me ... to ... teaching was going to be\nWe find that it stopped being paid market seems to be more prestigious and women have them being slowly shift I filled out\nRebecca get lecturing history of science at the university\nOf Ken's just how much wouldn't get filtered out was brought home by so the u._k. a few years ago they found that two thirds of the British public\nWas unable to name a single famous female scientist soap to end this program we've compiled views women working in stem subjects and asked them to name that stuff female scientists you'll hear new ping every time a name was mentioned [noise]\nMy name is real my actual engineer and my engineering hero is Emily ... have to take charge of delivering the Brooklyn Bridge to his father in law died in an accident on the site and her husband was injured\nAnd she made over\n... and I knew [noise] [noise] my role model in [noise] and my name is how development my age [noise]\nSafety designed to how I should know news around [noise]\n[noise] my name is Kay [noise] experiment is we have to get a ... billion times that they can do to get the fundamental building blocks of but\nI'd like to nominate stuck to somebody else you know to be but the damage that you know since the females are in general\nI Am just heard from the [noise] I like to highlight the stadium just for showing up her name will shed a passion and carbohydrate\nRich she was voted for women as a prize for medicine shortages okay [noise] lots\nOf things that some names to remember the next time we're off to a to name a stop female scientist that sits from this business daily maybe you can always get in touch with the program you can send your comments to all Twitter handle at BBC business or at BBC will biz ... to to handle", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "09"}
