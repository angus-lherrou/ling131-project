break the law are we talking about the emergency broadcast system every so often all American radio and TV channels sound a squawking granting alarmed to test the system which in theory would be used with us every one to a threat to\nOversee we don't want to cause any alone by playing the alarm so we just going to talk about the alum there's a new addition to it to keep up with the times a text message or let a fourteen twenty later today everyone\nAnd we mean literally everyone is going to receive a presidential election it's a text from the president and it's the first test of the late just a bit of\nThe emergency alert system you cannot opt out the move however since ... by everyone that there's some interesting issues behind this and history as well and we got it from Andrew ... who is with Harvard Kennedy School bell ...\nDealers system has been around for about fifty five years as a way for the president to quickly send a short message to the nation and the case of pretty much only set a nuclear attack where there was not a lot of time to furnish it message\nUm that message was always going to be carried on radio and television\nAnd most Americans will probably recognize the shrill attention tone that broadcast from the regular tests that had been going on right sought tomorrow's different because tomorrow will be the first time a system that was built over the last few years to allow it broadcast or directly to cell phones is being used for\nIts interesting isn't it though because cell phone's been around for a while because if the government is catching up a little bit late\nRight this was actually implement it as a couple of years ago during the Obama administration as a way to say the civil defense status that is\nThe emergency alert system needs to be modernized and now that we have this new phenomenon which is to say everyone in America more or less how the cell phone on their person um wouldn't it be nice to be able to reach them immediately\nOld television and radio channels would come together and we'll broadcast from wherever the prison walls or do a a sort of a pre recorded broadcast\nEssentially yes there was um a FCC requirements um the Federal Communications commission or in the U.S that you had to participate if your public broadcast or a private broadcaster for that matter ... so if you are one of the primary channels for your city or your region\nYou would be um made to carry a message or the or more just yet where it would go off and it would say this is a message from the White House stay tuned for more information\nThey were ... and they would they would do tests so Americans with ... with the sound but that would be told that this is a test of the system of the of the emergency broadcast system\nYes there was a required monthly test and some places they really tests as well but often you know it was a midnight or a little bit later so I'm a lot of people found out by when they snoozing on the couch or it would make them up in a very ...\nThat sounds like a cultural thing this is a trunk and the Americans know the outside of America wouldn't know that is that's a great detail I Love that so do people talk about this\nThere's been this rising tide of awareness where people are realizing that this is something that's going to happen this is coming straight to everybody and I think the part that's really getting people burn is the fact that it will say it will be labeled at the top of the the text message that arise as presidential alert\n[noise] yeah I'm a social media message from President Trump um that wouldn't be confusing would ditch [noise]\nUh no I I think at some point or another that is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taken away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency aware it to the entire nation that says\nNo collusion but there are also to road blocks I think having that happen right the first one is that is it legal they did set this up to say there is a way to you this is only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically would be illegal\nNow a lot of people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down the legal part won't stop someone who has already done so much to a scandal as the country um but the actual activation procedures it would go from the White House and and Trump's authority only but the procedures would be handled by FEMA\nSo the officials there would have a modicum of oversight to say the least\nI don't think that it would be like his Twitter account were hit on constrained access at any time\nRight so it is slightly filtered by the emergency management um uh people uh presumably Yukon reply to this text\nRight and [laughter] I I Want to think of what would happen if someone else took control of the system though and sent some message\nEither in farce or in you know ... to the entire country in the wrong moment right that that would be a a worse situation almost than having a real message come through\nA at an untimely time\nYeah reply old would lead to trouble wouldn't it address to see any of the ... center at the Harvard Kennedy School or just to spoil your anticipation that message are we going to get says this\nThis is a test of the national while this emergency alert system no action is needed ... coming from the you know are we going to get all caps ... for example well this is this is the thing I'm an ... in fact well what a hundred other people are interested eaten is the kind of the fact that many people who have a positive attitude to the current\nOccupy as the White House will just kinda go I don't want to miss the president's going to ignore it\nEven when it could be quite important [noise] and likewise if somebody else we're in the White House the other half of America would possibly avoid it as well as he was saying\nUm it just fills is the president count really send a personal message out there in mind that these false alarms do actually helping them at the Hawaii that there was a there was a a a false alarm with a ballistic missile which went home for ... minutes before\nThe puck was actually pulled the noise by the way I'm quite pleased we count ...

imagine so many people have mobile phone even in a little rings are studying like Liberia urban even rural areas of Liberia but there's still an issue because the people who use mobile phone might be of course\nA little bit in front of the people who don't use that and so we had to use some\nMeasure techniques after to make sure the ... and look at some samples from the the people got data from from the mobile phone to make sure that makes sense for the you know the larger population\nYeah cause I can imagine in a place like Liberia there's some pretty remote rural places where people either don't have a cell phone network maybe in some cases people who are illiterate maybe some of the people who need to help most are the ones you find the most difficulty and reaching\nYes no that's of course very important especially in the situation so we have to be a kind of approach in a little bit systematically meaning the wood for example over sample and places where it's more under developed there'll be less access and then we took a cat into account\nCharacteristics of people not just um what they were fun and in terms of their health care but you know what their socioeconomic were and other things to make sure we're getting information on it at a good a distribution of you know kind of good representation of the population\nAnd I wonder if these text messages because in many places

this boat but now we're going to cost to the states within two to one of the journalists behind\nThe big story in the New York times and in the American media which is an investigation into President Trump's family and the tax schemes which greatly benefited the president of the report talks about Donald Trump receiving large amounts of money from his parents are nothing wrong with that of course as you were about to hear\nA but it sort of contradicts the image that he's always presented to being a self made man who only started with a million builders\nThose are his words not mine a President Trump's lawyers as a responded to the times story saying the allegations\nOf fraud and tax evasion of one hundred percent photos and highly defamatory\nOr so for the president has broken with the practice of past presidents and has refused to release his tax returns there's programs because who just spoke to one of the journalists who had the story David Bosco\nEtiquette reveals too important ... is it reveals that the central narrative that Donald\nTrump has told throughout his life and especially in his political campaign for the price of the narrative that she is a self made billionaire basically started with a million dollar loan from his\nFather and turned it into this incredible Baldwin park but that narrative that is actually completely at odds with record itself that we are in
