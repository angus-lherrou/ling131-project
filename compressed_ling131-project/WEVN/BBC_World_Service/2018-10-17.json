everywhere across Canada but\nThe provinces and territory I have a lot of control so and everyone has an acted different laws regulating where you can consume it whether you can grow it at home where you can buy it that people are really going to have to pay attention to their local laws in order to figure out how to appropriately and\nWhich is a good Murphy is the news editor of BBC candidate she told me one of the government has it on the move\nWhen prime minister Justin Trudeau proposed this proposed legalizing recreational marijuana he said look Canadians are\nHeavy users especially worldwide considered heavy users of marijuana especially young Canadians prohibition is not working and so they proposed let legalized and regulated and that way it'll be in control of government they can keep it passed away from youth\nAnd they will take the money away from organized crime\nThe drug so the idea was prohibition isn't working regulation might so big day for coming to the\nVery big day it is obviously a sea change the drug has been\nA legal criminalized in Canada for almost a hundred years and of course globally as well there's been you know it's been a prohibition on marijuana so the fact that Canada will be the first G. seven country the second country in the world to fully legalized recreational use of the drug is a big change is a big step is everyone ready for it\nThat's a good question there are\nConcerns around a number of issues and still a lot of questions around it at first off questions around things like impair driving drug impaired driving whether our police forces are ready to fully deal with that as an issue that's one of the questions other questions are around the cat and the U.S border and\nWhether issues may arise because Canada federally will have\nLegal recreational marijuana federally the U.S does not whether that might be an issue so there's a lot of big questions like that and then again this\nEven though Seventeen October means legal recreational marijuana in Canada it means that the the regulation itself this new framework is going to be in its infancy as well as a whole retail market so it's still the very beginning of the process though it is the beginning\nAnd with income under itself traveling with marijuana is not so straightforward isn't\nHe will be actually if someone buys marijuana from illegal store and gets on a plane with it within a on a domestic flight for example that will be fine\nBut there will be very much a patchwork of regulations across the country so where you'll be able to buy it from depending on the province where you'll be able to use the drug to smoke the drug will depend on the province sometimes I mean it's ... so there is very much\nA patchwork of of how the rules will actually function on the day to day for the average Canadian\nI Believe it or something like what is it half a million people who have existing records for for possession of marijuana what will happen to them no\nWell it looks like there will be some form of amnesty the government has spoken over the last few months saying\nThey're open to that as an idea but they said their answer to it any formal

because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas knowing for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is essentially we're talking about hacking into the software Fortnite\nThat's right that basically accusing the paper of copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have spoiled it essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one though surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nWell this is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some fat he says or not some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think ... haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nKnow if it's not even a fuss for Fortnite rated I vote yeah they they had some people the rest of it I think in um uh this is a different game actually paranoid and bustle grounds and that it has to be\nYeah and an historic day it's been going on the is there's always been cheating games\nAnd like many things he gets in the video games journalist joining us life\nHas been shooting and all sorts of games um

protests began a few hours ago it was midnight struck first in Newfoundland in the eastern most of the country to be moving\nAcross a great celebrations Christmas Neal yeah each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was that in the provincial capital St John as midnight struck so who was sending the first batch\nIt's a company called time calls canopy gross it's actually whiter a large multinational company and they set up shop in St john's so they will be selling it you know over the counter here\nUm there are about three locations here in in St john's area that you can walk in off the street and by the candidates but for\nYou'll be ordering it on line it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls the sale of liquor\nAnd ah they brought in all the rules and regulations companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there\nAbout twenty two locations are in a in the country right now that in ... in the ... right now they can sell it and they will pay an excise tax the government so while it is regulated by government largely a lot of private companies\nTheir eye on this already and we got in first that it's a big companies that already um\nThat had already set down on\nHeck with down roasted other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move a midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and scenes that you'll see the\nOh I Would I Would say so St john's is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight it is quite amazing though I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities\nBut millions of people some of them are Canadians of wanted that for very long time and uh when Justin Trudeau around to be prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers and down\nAnd regulated in an attempt to to grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now are looking at Canada to see what Canada is going to do because our way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done if within safe but\nCanada is really a leader\nLot of people will be looking at how this on hold it will not be without bomb that hiccup\nFrom law enforcement to actually whether there's even enough marijuana that the one thing we've been hearing that the last number of days that\nThey expect that demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of suppliers are probably going to run out even within the first date\nRight is it because it's such a stampede the basically the country's going to be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but people will have to take it and bring it home or take it in and\nSmoke at in private because it's governed by the same rules as alcohol or smoking\nThat's Chris O'Neal yanks in St Joe Newfoundland or she was reporting that with the upper ... behind hook you up for their legal kind of his uh for the Canadian

times but now deal has been signed\nSo last year the deal sea government off two competing consult you to join forces the company that built the Three Gorges dam in China and Spanish Company called ACS and now looks like a deal between those three ... pious as being penned\nAnd it's being money being delayed and his had also also goes I mean it's been a long time coming two years ago the world bank a froze the disbursement of Seventy three million dollars of its cash that it was putting into a helpful technical assistance because it said\nThe country have taken the project in a different strategic direction than had been a great\nSo tell us about the significance of the scale of it how big it is\nIt's huge um I mean the idea for the and gets three is to complement the two existing power stations on the Congo river there about two hundred and sixty kilometers downstream from Kinshasa near the anger falls\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as the Jews are it's got fixed phases and\nWe'll take more than ten years to complete complete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred megawatts of power\nNow that's about the same amount of energy as three nuclear power stations China\nDoes the DR scene neater used that much power as\nWell as it doesn't but it means that the power supply in the deal if he can be expanded way beyond the ten percent of the population who currently have reliable electricity supply\nWhich is of course great for economic growth and also be a boost for the country's ... province in the southeast this is where all the mining takes by some mining uses a great deal of energy\nAnd it also means the deals so you can be a big power export to to the rest of Africa not just its neighbors but as far south as South Africa which has actually already signed an agreement to take power from the ... project\n[noise] huge prospects then for the are

representing the governing finagle poverty in Brussels her primary focus\nIs British it now as a nation stands to be as affected by Britain's departure from you as island the only land border between the u._k. and the union is the frontier between norm island um the Irish Republic\nIt's what happens with that border and the states as a ... mile and post Brexit has become the biggest obstacle\nTo a deal as the torturous bricks negotiations into the final phase\nAnd the the Irish Question ... any sort of agreement but could either the you know the u._k. really let that\nWell Murray McGinnis joins me now welcome to talk to him [noise] are you surprised that after a year and a half of intense negotiations between you\nHere we are all with fish and game that I just described underway and it seems the issue of the Irish border and the coverage breakfast stages of Northern Ireland are\nObstacles that cannot be overcome\nI'm disappointed maybe I'm not surprised but I'm not without hope so just sent me take this week because everyone's quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um but what is happening as the talks are continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there's an impasse and it's not surprising that the issue of\nNorthern artist and the island of Ireland is the issue that the withdrawal agreement if\nYou like it still has to be completed on because remember it isn't just the ... you or\nMe as an Irish semi pie or the our government insisting on this the United kingdom the bushes prime minister\nLast December signed up to\nAn opposite of

in Greenland and be incomplete parts are around\nAnd northern are and what has troubling to me I have to say is that normally when we go see a certainly I think you level have papers produced I don't talk what's on your paper for example but I'm going to propose changes I guess what you won't agree with all of them but you take someone board\nThat has not happened in these negotiations what is happening on this is a troubling part that I Hope we can get over is that the u._k.\nSide and that is their right to do they have said well\nWe don't like what started we went to an all around we're proposing that in the future relationship we'll\nAgree to this if you're like time and then the customs arrangement temporary customs arrangement and in a way trying to reverse the future\nOf Reverend

that the British Government led by Theresa May is remaining on ... me when it comes to this so called Irish ... if I Want\nTo see is that what I Would but I'm not using it I think she hasn't delivered yes\nOn promises made that is a big step from saying she's ... and I understand the pressure that cheese on or what not blind to the politics of the conservative party I'm not blind to the fact that the D you pay is propping up to the conservative government there's a budget votes on the twenty ninth of a toga\nTo use those what are your words but what I'm saying it's what what we're told me more and I tried to explain this to David David says one thing when he was a part of what they the Brexit negotiations that to understand the psychological impact of breakfast you have to be their lives there and I lived and know what has happened\nAnd I think that's the part that the discussion that people aren't hearing\nAnd you have to obviously respect different views on that but at some point when when language is used like I say she had not blood red lines that some\nToday for example I read I wouldn't even say it on television was quite a vulgar comment about this I thought were going to fire here and that's like comments required but also understanding that the u._k. is leaving nothing you can\nReally shocking now so much energy from the European Union everybody's been raining on to say they're a much bigger dangerous and challenges facing that you and for you as a\nAs an official with the U.S all the movie it was vice president of the European is not an official for different that's\nFair enough you'll rule is vice president the European Parliament how worried are you by the fact that in the midst of all this fuss about ... what we don't seem to be focused on is that certain countries in the like Poland and Hungary legs are simply refusing to play by the new rules and accept\nBasic you values when it comes to things like a free media and independence and the Jews\nIssue and I think we all should be worried about that of course we're all concerned about it that's why I voted that there should be a ... a review of what's going on and how seven ... motives\nOf them don't work because not only a potent hungry for themselves but they are acting with the support of a block of countries that hate articles which would allow them to be disciplined by the ... commission ISI Jay and others it won't work\nI Know but I we I've met picked or been face to face and I said to him my concern about what's going on in his country at so bill under no illusion that ... that is a big issue where also dealing with those other fundamentalists\nI'd wanna portions they at least within the European Union you have a capacity to influence and to bring out to go seven which you say is not going to work\nWell in fact you say we are dealing with it on the radical seven article ... which triggered last year against Portland this year the polls have pressed on with these judicial changes which have been told the president basically getting rid of molten God on the judges on the ... protests about it the more the polls say we don't\nCare yeah when you're in a different job than I Am my job is to make sure that the polish leadership understands that the root of a half to prevail\nEven if that takes longer than I Would like that we keep demanding high standards and the the benefits of Europe is that at least these countries are with us around the table but it doesn't take away from the court point there are deep\nAnd not in the division it also seems to me that the the the the strain of nativist nationalist populist populist politicians which would include those in governing in Poland and Hungary\nAre making the political weather and politics like yours in the center right that is Gail and the wind to block in Europe the European people's party\nThey are running ... of these people your own blog refused to expel victims will ...\n... European finally but first\nOf all I'm not running scared of I knew I'm from a small country but I'm putting brave and my politics\nSecond laid the bushes conservatives did not vote to function Mr Obama on hungry so there's a question for them to answer and partly the pressure will be a relentless what's happening within the ... group are deep conversations above what is happening with Viktor Orban I've I bought him and told him what Ali ...\nAbout the parents can we learn how to put ... we\nWe have said very charity our views of faded I has ... the leader of our group who also voted to sanction hungry we have not yet and go to that point it may come where we say we cannot be together but don't come place uh know traumatic action with in activists say there's a huge amount of active\nOh so you say but look what\nDo I say with respect so I Know because I'm involved in\nThe truth is you have governments across east Europe who refused to accept the\nNotion of burden sharing when it comes to taking from his office immigrants on a whole host of other issues including the creation of a new security force putting ten thousand gone into from Texas east Europeans won't buy it so all of these issues when it comes to that whole issue of migration the notion of collective you action it's just not happening\nNot yes but the pressure would have to be in that direction because for one simple fact the biggest driver of migration flows would not be conflict but it would be climate change and Europe needs to do more on that the reason why is a land those who have been at the forefront of receiving migrants are angry as they see Europe has a ... and then\nThe Turks point is that the number of migrants coming to Europe has dramatically decreased but what very worrying if you have any concern about human beings is that the woman a scene die so what so for Asian arrivals one person dies and has died in the first couple of months of this year that is a horrific statistically\nHomage to the arguments about what to do and they seem increasingly buying the arguments of the fall right back to\nMention the pieces of Europe but that said in the u._k. because the u._k. referendum was in my view at fueled\nBy false ... and ... and I just say that but I don't mind gracious an interesting point they're going to do with why because frankly when it comes from the\nEuropean elections the Brits will not be voting for the round your polling evidence suggests that Mr so meaning that\nMarine Le Pen's party in ... with a whole host of foreign policies and countries as far apart as Poland Hungary Austria you name it\nThey have the political ... some very outgoing and unless you are very adamant\nBut very at the weekend with the greens that actually what the surprise if you like the gas or as an under our music is coming up Wednesday you should watch out for them but the mood across Europe definitely politics as polarizing I chaired the European Parliament and increasingly when I called votes\nYou see that the extremes on the right and left vote the same way on issues so it's not just about ideology here there's something else happening in ... in the body politic I mean I Would worry about whether the central can hold or seen the Social Democrats quite fractured\nAre only ... Christian Democrats that could be quite election\nBut are you to the that the mainstream blow yeah the people in the European socialist and many people according to the opinion belongs to me but according to opinion polls to many people around Europe they look like the tie tired old to Brussels elites who have no delivered I Know the\nThe ... when you see you're using the language which field a referendum here and quite frankly becoming a bit tedious I may I may have aged since I got elected but I'm not tired\nLook for in my ... am I actually happens in Hungary unpaid when this is reality\nJob is not to give in to a reality that I Believe would be bad for my children and I have four of them and in fact I warn them I say to them you have taken for granted pace on this continent because it's there nothing is given on my biggest worry and I do some that are with this sometimes is that we will wonder what the European Union\nDid which was developed peace and prosperity on the continent of Europe for that idea\nThat you can have your own individual policy or you can be a popular when when you have to do is say something would not take the responsibility for us I take responsibility for what I Do and what I say and I hope that in the European Parliament elections we talk about Europe and not national issues because they tend to be a button\nOn his own appreciate

combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in Airbus Boeing that absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York\nOr London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry a maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the one\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from radiation energy a local employee owned company helping thousands have granted staters go solar\nRevision energy is currently growing their team electricians and plumbers learn more at revision energy dot com slash careers\nModel that's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think the most traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have ... regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the cell Palo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something the theoretical it actually already exists in one city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting in I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now from those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere it's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic\nHow soon are we going to see this revolution you're describing\nSo I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all ... out by saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus in less like a taxi or going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option and then it just starts to grow from there\n... bunch of vertigo arrow hair on business day even the b._b._c.\nThe really for the new tech will be when these flying drones become not just a novelty play thing for rushed overpaid business executives but when they also are a viable option for ordinary people that you will meet\nWell some Seventy or eighty starts up battling to develop the hard way and ride sharing tech them but also is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in lobbying Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job in galvanizing the industry employing everybody together to go after the common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but really but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America or is it going to start somewhere else about the regulatory hurdles less Hi yes\nMy estimation is is Hong Kong\nRight it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and it just a natural fit\nYeah a lot of islands to jump over ... less dangerous for that reason because when you're not going to crush onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight you over the water most of the time but you know if you look around the world a lot of a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\n... besides it's hyping to pilot flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas New York or Paris\nAs soon as twenty twenty five but it is that actually unrealistic shut you give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to become a professor Steve right from the university the west of England will listen to worry first time we have a ... an accident which can be attributed to machine\nAs you can imagine people kind of lose their mind and say\nWe're getting very very carefully because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon it's a real worry and that's providing pulls facility for us in the industry\nBack in the seventies I think they used to be\nA helicopter taxi service operating around New York and then it flipped over and killed ... people and\nThey're not really done it since have they oh what's the Pan Am building listen to whether it's a helicopter crash that that was cool by Gus in say again we have problems in developing these technologies but oddly enough this is\nOne area in which the technology actually sells the problem we've had in the past I think the the ... that will pay an easing in period we the public needs to get used to the idea so just in the same way that we had the\nThe the person walking in front of the car waving a red flag because that's where that is I ever actually happened I doubt that that was the early days of ... early days it makes it makes the vehicles exactly\nWe a if a if a law and\nWe need to get used to ideas and so once it's seen to be Paul solve our everyday lives and this is what's possible with this new technology people will accept it how long will it be how long will it take to we get to some kind of drugs and drug ... boss taxi\nI but I Would love to say I mean this is this is the question everybody asks me my particular hunch timescales is ten to Fifteen Years now the thing is I'd love to be proved wrong in this case because I really well by flying a really well by flying taxi\nBut the number of hoops we've got two and should jump through as well in order to make sure this equipment is demonstrably say now will take time in the in the sense that we read and just now deciding which groups we do need to jump through\nProfessor of aerospace engineering Steve right and not just about it for this program ... these days flying controls tomorrow\nShe'll be asking how can you switch off from your office when you're not at work your emails you mentioned
