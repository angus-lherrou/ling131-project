some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore I'm\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't you only is it ... you know you almost like gas yeah you don't even Hitler acts anymore you just feel it [noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you count the problem is sometimes you get a track and I like can you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular as director Comey but\nYou know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly but more often than not I actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many ... hours I recently pitched on the cot is a ... and Jay Z and\nI knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in that ... busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to\nHer I just had to come up with an idea and my heart for the best you know I didn't quite know at that time but that's the part of being a director is that\nThere is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success rate show but maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out that because there's a lot of direct it out there\nThat's a that's a larger scale I mean yeah I had the opportunity to watching of course with some amazing artist but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then then again it's not genes look beyond\nYou are listening to the conversation I guess

think Academy of specific examples where you have to navigate accommodating to sing sing holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points way somebody when something a little bit different than say just end does well yeah\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way 'cause I mean I have to put myself in a specially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps going to medical male dominated field and then at the added cross all starting off on television so I was the only person\nThat now want it to to be a girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was\nEvery time you get the opportunity you have to knock it out the park\nThe first ever project that I did well official project and I did music video and was a music video for an award ceremony that I was one of those\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song and then they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what do you do not like you know I'm a direct analogy but yeah I mean this is what we want you to start when you come out of the stage and things like that and I remember just from one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be a visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the show\nAnd he called me like I was like I actually love this treatment and bite off you're getting into I caught that one and I needed to make a decision on to them I said you know what how about you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me just what I Need to execute this project and you get a better deal could of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point that got that chalk eventually\nTo position myself and it wasn't heritage but I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten more boosted tuition but that is the only project and I have to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card universe and a lot of people call me they don't even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because it just means and videoed and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nLike I can talk about how much are charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kinds of ideas on how they ... you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging offend it depends on the\nProject that things I charge denied that things are charging dollar a dip ... their partners like I'll give you figured that projects\nDo that I Do for nothing at all but that's what I Believe me the most money when they came to me my budget or the little bit too much for them I really love the the project I Want it to the parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in that particular project might not have\nLightened my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people are seeing that and gone I needed to work in this project alright stronger somewhere\nIt's an effort is going to be given to me I can get at your level\nNow I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she or challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter] because they're the rule of thumb that older actors get temp set of budget\nWhat would be typical budget I mean can you give me\nSupport

associate professor in development economics at Oxford University here in the u._k. we have a very\nDelicate and difficult situation I had the first perhaps and foremost is the fiscal situation which is very worrisome I Will have a extremely large deficits and a growing public that we need to urgently shape public spending for the TV of labor has stagnated so the challenges are had a considerable\nWhat do you think is the thing that the people who voted for both scenario what you think that they will wants him to do first in terms of the economy in terms of business\nTo me honestly it's unclear what the demand is in terms of economic policies I think they are voting for him for a kind of like a sense of security and to tackle directly corruption I don't think people understand what the stakes are and what the necessary measures are to attack or economic challenges\nI think they believed that actually he will be able to cut taxes which has been er into that but I don't think that's possible at all given that we have to tackle our current deficit I think they also expect major privatization and reducing the scope for example for corruption in state owned enterprises\nBut now it's also unclear whether or not he will actually implemented\nIn Palo graduates at least we're talking about a man who is a very free\nMarkets economist believes in the free market so the privatization that's not something that Brazil has had a huge amount of experience with at least with most recent governments more socialist policies have been in place is is it can be a problem to implement those kind of policies in Brazil\nAbsolutely absolutely I think there is a scenario where he embraces ... agenda and tries to implement a just a extreme as liberalism and economic liberalism in Brazil\nI think he will face a fierce opposition from unions social movements that will be led by the tea which is actually pretty good at playing the opposition pro so I think we can be looking at an equilibrium similar to Argentina for example where like you have strikes every other day and a very serious political impasse\nThe financial markets have been welcoming both ... ... and the polls over the last few weeks and will no doubt welcome his ...\nMr I think so I think there's a lot of wishful thinking their economic liberalism can only work its magic if it's implemented on a

World Service Brazilian economists Gabrielle elicit they was talking about whether the free market reforms could work in Brazil there is a cool a precedent for this in Latin America ... Paolo judges will be familiar with\nOkay with me here judges studied economics at the University of Chicago in the U.S in the Nineteen seventies and other times Chicago's economics department was well known as a sense of for free\nMarkets theory led by the influential American economist Milton Friedman and it was in the Nineteen seventies that a group of Chilean economists\nLater dubbed the Chicago Boys because they do say studied under Friedman sets about making rather cool free market reforms to chilies economy under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with dramatic consequences\nOr find out more about what happened from total of ... as a journalist in film producer in Santiago in Chile she recently made a documentary called Chicago Boys\nGuys were very young when they went to the U.S and the fifties they learn something that they never knew before it does is open market and free market economy\nWhen they came back in the sixties they try to implement these ideas that they learn from Milton Friedman but nobody heard them they were too extreme extreme in the meaning that they're free market we're going to ruin everything and that people would will suffer a lot\nSo they couldn't go ahead with their ADS deal yeah they're good at at\nAt leading by the military and Pina ... came [noise]\nIt wasn't a fortunately for them to apply all they\nKnow that they get in their states underneath on fragments a guidance in ...\nSo that the who and the takeover by a cause to finish a that gave them the opportunity to enact some of the theories that they learned about free markets economics in America\nRight because they didn't have any support among the traditional politicians ...\nSo they knew that they they made Terry we're going to be strong enough to go ahead with their extreme economy policies so they saw these as our windows to get into power and to apply this extreme ADS being supported by the military guns\nWhat what were these extreme economic ideas what kinds of things were they doing\nFirst of all days they thought that the state was mostly on usable that the power of the economy should be in the private hands there is one phrase that they said when things been known to everyone\nThey don't belong to any one day we a distrust their state so they wanted to have that small state as possible so what are they successful they were very successful um they came to power with Pinochet more or less the same day two years later\nThree and they weren't able to implement all their idea backed by the guns from the military\nAt some point they're pouring tea layer raised to an unbelievable amount by the eighties we we had more than forty percent of the population without a job\nSo people were really suffering we have people living in poverty we doubt houses without shoes on these was because all the national industry went to bankruptcy\nSo it was a very very extreme way off implement their their ideas bought by this the force by by their guns or the military if anyone wanted to complain the military's came with the guns and they stop any kind of protest on the street\nThat was the I guess the short term impact of these radical free market reforms\nSome people hold up chili is an example of free market successor in the longer term the economy was very prosperous and more prosperous than other economies in Latin America\nYes this is very interesting because it's too\nWe became the richest country in Latin America but since two thousand ten thousand eleven and the people here in ... has been complaining about the long term results of these kind of success\nMost of the richness belonged to five or ten families the economic concentration hearing tea laced huge day inequality that is huge also I think we have to\nHide inequality rates from the OCD\nWe also have some kind of problems a depression rates suicidal rates of SAT rates delinquency rates are really high so we are rich but that doesn't mean we are better steel there is controversy\nIf you come to to let you will see other developed countries that access to material things are better than before\nBut this society had to have a hard scar\nFrom dictatorship you know\nThe ... made a decision\nThey choose their economic growth over the defense of the human rights and that made us car in our society we rode knowing that the economics were more important and life at some point\nRight now we are I think I Believe we are living in a change\nWe are changing for among very individual on competitive society to more solidarity society so it seems now after
