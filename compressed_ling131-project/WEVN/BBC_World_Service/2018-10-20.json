University welcome to you all I'd like to begin by all the each of you will seize identity politics will do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think a ... that has been given and is used to describe claims for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to them on to equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the ... I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have left to do with identity of a sudden that in with questions of justice we can talk about that a little bit more Adrian\nPast what does it mean to you that's politics is really about individualized identity individuals and small groups very often focal minorities that saw rocky arguing for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now at a very sort of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in countries so there's a problem I think in that\nIt's a response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than a more communal collective Islam\nYes among you know to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on to the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAs sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re center the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about grew to ... elements of the state line or try to [noise]\nI think the term go here's around the ideas that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by groups into which we were born in that way I I regarded as anti individual for my own part\nThough is that rather an important point Adrian ... does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand by technocratic leads ... abstract things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and I think none of his very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you at Venus message or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBut the way to go over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ...\nThat doesn't ... ... if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have some not recognized\nAs vets exactly in fact what the tea movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what happened was actual swans and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but that is real discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified you would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with a white um how can go into sort of dramatic love story they have no partners\nUm [laughter] I was amazed by the way in which by the movie which tells in the mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left saying what isn't the problematic that this round protecting this has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan\nAnd I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the writer was saying who has if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left but some of food that was problematic exercise leave for me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation those on you to picture and in a movie of into ...\nI didn't see politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is\nThe way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy a wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of\nCommonality is very different from the reality of hierarchical differentiation and exploitation and we have to address\nThe fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we caught stone politics into all kinds of button all Hollywood wrong call\nNine eleventh for you in 'cause he wants to come into the air I think on the issue of algae Beatty rights and the way that change but feel free to come into ... well\nI think the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics\nIs that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates\nA social atmosphere of fearful is on a an an artery social level not necessarily just on special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word\nMe might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying\nAnd they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's the intolerance that long ago just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together somehow to differences defined as more than the cannot be of course they're real differences out to be celebrated\nBut also the coming out and she says her we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring them into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus on that shouldn't be warm\nBut the moment we simply thinking that gender race religion and other different somehow from everything else and that's the way that politics has become\nSo ... I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I sort of handwringing about authoritarianism and lack of commonality and differences\nBut I'm not hearing an example of the only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo let me give you a couple of examples of what I wanted to make the but I think a black lives matter in many ways was an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and but this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers is also true but the majority of people who are killed by police\nAfrican American and that's not surprising given the reds be small portion of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be a more fruitful and we'll put it to be a few cases if we sat\nThere is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deep injustice but you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's two white people who got shot by the police as well\nI Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this off ... people have never lived in Mount a cultural religious monolingual states this is new new situation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's just 'cause I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some fee and along the function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations in the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness as a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized nothing the problem with the center then too it's by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier Russia\nWell it's like to disagree with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world with founded on a ... ethnic multi cultural self conception of themselves and thank God who started the challenge that and we now live in society so much for most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies that that is something you talked to quite new\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of\nThe world's wealth and one of the ways in which they're addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a\nFalse and indeed authoritarian narrative out that way by age is minority than black people and women and townspeople and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for any quality and suffering\nOkay pledge to think about that thank you for ... panel\nBanned by the Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver in Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think that the program or any ideas the topics he likes to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC don't kettle UK or treat me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll to cost app\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

P. D. which is the leftist sent about ... ...\nIt seems that those his entourage choosing policies which have clear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say day if the anti immigrant uh you know I'm white time working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and the biggest space people pushing themselves into those\nBut what I think now because the mainstream parties on offering something that's inclusive and off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with ... of course the working class is not simply washing and lots of other components of the of the working tells us off with an often suffered more than the white working class but\nSaying the other people have suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide also you know we'll rebelled against the status quo and and who are we to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much as last semester father does not hurting I'm not saying you did what I'm saying is\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe're here but look at the most depressed people under the only ones that my son in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the Persian Gulf in a rational utility maximizing preaches we are people who are involved each\nWe're people embedded in relationships institution the nuts and feelings do methane is angel belonging and and they were going to place to people to communities and countries masses we kind of feeling out of politics I only got to\nThe obvious question that footage from that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease parts of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing offensive on the longing that actually ... the identity that was that\nWhether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland uh after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly\nYou're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one\nIn fact that's a boring observation and northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their try then they want representatives\nWho are going to put their case most forcefully and advocate for their interests not the larger interest\nBut their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on Nick durable\nIn some ways it works if you'll never end the remote the in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it winds bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic um in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity\nIs laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive\nClumps sorry I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural\nTendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into small groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away\nBut it but it's all the politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay I mean I'm\nVery bad language singled out yeah I mean I think the question is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village\nIt might become a particular religious or ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in ... to the society in a productive\nManner but one on such which I've person these talks have been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen I look at the politics of lost twenty twenty five years I don't think that's realistic because ... especially in the age of globalization nationalism retain an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim as ... to make it inclusive to say that he's a high a a collective uh it is a level of the kingdom of looking at states up and obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups\nUnder the common identity ... how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite\nTo being if you like a flag waving patriots [noise] um\nIs something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know doc a side of history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who love that country it's a question of mutual respect\nTo the other hand over all the anxiety saying that you love found that it really enjoy it isn't that are going to tour what's wrong and loving your country and its people accused other people of identity politics but I'm saying that your national deserve you opposed to nationalism I imagine you are and your your your\nUm your your national color thing making my country\nBut the majority\nOf of of Hindu majority of them so I look at nationalism that's something that had served its purpose in the anti colonial struggle but today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the writer response will be the ... for it is the or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians are respective\nAre not going to eat out is that he is not true and it's not as though the older a form of nationalism and the Congress talk he didn't have ... elements to it the one hand though it is now a days of areas of angry as well as the\nAgent if if I can bring you back then in a sense that there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such a good\nThing well 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching that can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's found bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further that kind of cosmopolitan and they all spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think the ... isn't that up so I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we manage to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and beyond says that\nIf everybody identifies primarily with the national try and say I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live to gather productively and peacefully whereas if we've had our\nSense of collective pride at the level\nWhich coincides with the actual ...\nCents doesn't everybody carry multiply and of course on the edge of the English in between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted the of course we do and\nThe people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way but I fired for the cause of people who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest is ... emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group\nGoes against the ideal of the whole a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent and let's demonize any form of collective flowing above the level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a common ... that's\nA bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British national it's something that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a\nSub nationalism that anything less nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down there's a clear correlation between what you would call some nationalism that ... nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast and so again\nIf you don't

World Service\nRemember if you like the program and we'd like to hear some more of our recent shows that are available as podcasts\nToday we're trying to find out the truth behind a video about men spreading that went viral in Russia and videos that according to a European Union website wasn't fact a piece of propaganda staged by the ...\nBetter now check one two Oh yes a lot better allotted either\nThat's Josh Russell you had that testing the microphone funny thing about him\nKind of leaves a double life by day he's a systems analyst\nBy night he becomes a Russian troll ... to\nKnow yeah I Do it totally for fun I live in Indiana it's cold here right playing video games at night and if you don't have TV is sort of what I usually do and uh at the current moment I'm into hunting down these Russian trolls\nAnd just to be clear he does it's totally free as far as we know he's not on the payroll full any security or intelligence agency that's Jesse ... thing he goes out of his way to identify social media accounts that are deliberately and openly staring arguments on line\nThis sounds like the kind of forensic work that you'd expect security or intelligence agencies to be doing a Josh has a background in programming and I T\nHe understands social media and he knows the mind a patrol because well he used to be a troll he got a kick out of pushing people's buttons on line\nAnd\nHaving full of dozens of Russian troll accounts having studied that behaves yet ... isn't a great position to tell us wanting to mission wolf that looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of these men spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that you see\nThese Russian trolls or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again they're going to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their\nState funded media social media platforms and then they're going to start talking about that piece of information\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked [noise]\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is that\nDr molten Bayh he's a research fellow at the center for deep still future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan\nWhen Star Wars the last ... came out last year some ... with the casting choices you see never before I had a star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse ... thing prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Ryan Johnson\nSome of them except the behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number\nFrom Russia at the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before the election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kinda have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter\nLet's stick to digest that it's not the divisions haven't always existed in society to take the star wars example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices than would always be some people who would agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... All right what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating de spaces and sending up the volume as each of those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggles to take action\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic point of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already look with skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority\nView that can often be found on Russian state media and the context of\nConversations about the me too movement and so won\nThe ... is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvy do get picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nOr it's the only down to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that ... conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias then divvied year will only concerned is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of this senseless political correctness brigade in action [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program can we conclusively say the N is video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ... campaign against this information\nSuggesting if you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one but what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode suddenly fits into a broader pattern\nOne very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's disinformation campaign\nIt this week for BBC trending on my ... and I'm Marco Silva the program was mixed by James Beard\nNashua eighty eight point three W E VH Hanover Ninety One point three W easy and\nKeen Ninety point seven WABC Gore him when he was seven point one Wu VJ Jackson Ninety nine point five WALDS cobra Ninety point three and W.

correspondence Jessica Murphy went to see one of the first kind of bishops opened its doors in British Columbia\nAn unassuming sore from the outside very simple design and what I saw of course when I got there in the morning before it opened was people starting to line up and we saw that across Canada people lining up\nOutside of these new legal stores are waiting for it open to be among the first customers of legal cannabis in the country\nSome of them said you know they'd been waiting for this for forty years for fifty years\nAnd you know others said they never thought they'd be something like this in a lifetime so when the door open to attend in the morning first customers walk in you know big cheer corrupted and throughout the day it's people were coming out they were showing off what they thought they were really just excited to be part of of that day that legalization in Canada\nCanada goose is only the second country all the Europe wide to to legalize cannabis fly legalized why this decision well the reasoning by the Trudeau government is that prohibition has been a failure in their view that Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian youth miners teenagers and so on\nSo they said look we're going to try and bring in this new strict control regulation framework instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective is the one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce that some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then\nWell just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are\nWill be able to purchase from a license producer and possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form\nAnd you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork he signed some places you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example ... most populous province you can use it a sense the the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes you use tobacco so that's roughly\nWhat it looks like now that is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market\nTo possess over thirty grams there actually some new and fractions around selling minors\nWhich carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison now of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development older not everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug for people under twenty five so there are concerns around developing brains issues around mental health a society representing gynecologist an obstetrician\nOf using the drug among pregnant women concerned about the development of the fetus so again both organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions\nNow we're hearing a lot about a green rush about the possible boon to the economy that this development could have what are people thinking about that\nIn the months up to legalization here in Canada I mean one of the headlines that you saw almost every day it was just talking with the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested\nIn joining this legal market to give you an idea candidate statistics agency it's national agency crunched the numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was an aide twenty Seventeen they found that Katie and used or spent rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on candidates\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nAnd of course because Canada is doing this and it's a it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely they\nAbsolutely ... and across the world is just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana and we're seeing obviously Canada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model\nBut a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drag on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries look meet decriminalization so having this experiment in Canada seeing whether or not\nThe Trudeau government is able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously other countries looking at that and

the ... you know\nLet's move on the smartphone has revolutionized all kinds of industries but one business he's trying to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler phones ... is a social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which the farmers used to see can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and I asked him what kind of people used it\nAgainst their primary level we're targeting people here don't have those other ways of communicating with each other so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africans East Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information knowledge and how to improve their farmer or bottle a disease now so we farm or we need all those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture\nIn just about any local language for free or get spoke content back or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that your technology is very simple technology it's SMS just does that ... well\nSo it's it's simple in the front end or so and that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty character it's it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get confidence people in such a simple for a minute\nOr so when a former U.S as a question uh for example on on as a mess\nWe don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis too much them two or three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question and get this for ten bucks original farmer\nNow you'd you'd go to a million members I think you just signed up a million the millions member walk what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people\nYeah so it would pass a million which is as I was a great milestone for us having to one point two million I'm I mean I think the the ... biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it and even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched um so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute\nKnow in context as is probably nearer seven or eight percent on Twitter\nUm you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month which gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fun systems here there's not a social system itself I value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so\nThink that's probably the primary indicator would say uh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits they're seeing from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information to help them save their their livelihoods and farms through before\nIt was an example of how it's been years or so I mean the example\nI gave is a there's a a chicken farmer that was using we farm in Kenya called called castle he kept on the in the region of of fifty chickens I'm as and this was his entire livelihoods paid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table or on a disease was ... killed you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days\nOr any ask questions about this and we farm and go get information back a which vaccines to use it I just thought the disease spreading a managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihoods and that's that's the kind of vital\nYou know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental through these farmers but we found is able to to to provide\nA Kenny you in from we from a Mona El ... from ... in a special guest uh\nUh that wasn't one of those red nail public or the positive stories about social media or five years ago and one of the social media was going to save the world that was it was a positive uses we've all that changed totally\nYes to Santa eleven was the year we celebrate in social media we thought it's going to the world it enables people and a three carry genes to move to towards democracy to mobilize masses\nTowards the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regimes weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for activist real people are very very few\nPeople didn't practical things like that\nYeah ... exactly will use social campaigns to reach people over and it's about stuff but\nLater on we start moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit so it's now a battle between two items the that the\nPeople people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them so this is why we now are talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together\nSo have many many many positive effects but\nOf course the perfect then that gets to highlight all the time\nA commercially it's still very important um I ... it is connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we're getting more good than bad from it\nBut we're still getting good but we are getting better now in the last seven maybe seven years ago I Would have failed because we're getting all the good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's regulated and make sure it's it's under control maybe we don't know\nOne very brief would use every climbing or you still positive about social media\n[laughter] I think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think that's another good that comes out but it's not I for one another\nThat's all we got time for anything on the positive ... thanks to my special guest Mona El
