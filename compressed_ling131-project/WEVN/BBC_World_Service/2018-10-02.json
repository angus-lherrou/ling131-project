do it it's just\nDifferent Activision work we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just ask what was your breakfast I usually asked by patients do they have you eaten either\nBecause she sometimes for gets herself she has ten kids then she'd have an even eaten you know the ... she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your clinic when a female patient walks in one of the things you're taking into consideration and it comes to like I was thinking I think for\nMy last eleven years since I went back home my view it's completely change it because I got my education from Russia and now you spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home\nWith this western mentality of you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling what to do what's right and\nOne patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came she really a leading in

time I was walking away from her bedside she just told Manhattan and telling me you know I have six or for the children I just to get my second husband if I don't give him\nA child he was just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen and shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my view become more broader start listening an approach my patient more holistically where they're coming from is not only being a physician who or training to what that time for my clinical skill and went ...\nWent to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you face take all the first ones off skew point about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and cause for known because most treatments were designed for men and women went inside well\nScience has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals\nThere's a real sense that using female animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight they have a menstrual cycle and that's the reality of women\nSo much of our science has been done on a male model\nEven when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women in late face clinical trials you're still dealing with the issue of the science on which the clinical trials was based being based on a male model\n[noise] and can you give us an example of a disease that affects the chief ... different she sure\nLet me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we see in cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque or the hardening of those arteries and the heart\nThat tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference\nSo if you don't understand why you see the difference question arises do we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked\nThere are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences in biology\nWomen are more likely to develop Alzheimer's women are more likely to develop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the biology but not yet something this actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg\nBut the good news is that we are learning these things but we still have a very long way to go\nNow Dick who you are working in the money a country that has seen almost two decades of civil war and up until recently there was no central governing authority [noise] what was the greatest Barry is chief ... treatment for the woman in UK everything you can imagine\nIt there because when you don't have any situation where you don't have lost to follow you know the brutality

in many levels but if things not improved with the new government [noise]\nNot yet the whole health\nSystem is run by a World Health organization the government is very poor did enough money to invest in healthcare still everything you focus in its among tuition and infection where we're neglecting their diabetes and chronic diseases so it's still difficult it's still hard and one thing that\nThe health care was improved for the last\nCouple years it's a family planning program and schools child spacing so that's the one area we got progress and we educate much mother said we'd give the injection we have delivered all hospitals free\nInjection isn't and birth control bills so we're pushing on that site and I'm very proud to have those\n[noise] and point to teasing translate new research into into biology how do you translate that when you're working in the type of environment that day covers describing\nYou're really thinking about what are not only the disorders that diseases that affect women\nBut also what is the context of that disease\nSo for example if we were to start to think about lung disease\nIn certain areas for example in Africa and other places one of the main causes of pulmonary disease pneumonia but also chronic pulmonary disease or cook stoves to see what the end result is but how do you begin to understand and unravel\nNot only what is the cause of it but how do you change practice practice is so connected to culture and to use those structures within a culture to change behaviors and that's something that doesn't happen overnight\nDeclare anything to add to that you're right it's just cultural change and also development change you know government to test to change it not only hospitals and medications you just took

health and health care delivery through a gender lands using the best science but also the best understanding of how women are leading their lives I Would actually call that really good medicine\nAs

although this is also in the ... there's a big market nearby it's at all in the corner\nHow'd you get away from harming most other businesses you say you're taking a long viewed away from us\nSo in this debate you have professional to better also sitting along with us along with wall India's a so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better than not taking their business over\nIts course here my my point to go ahead what we find is obviously\nPoliticians are but it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nI'm what we find is that people and all that kind of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair uh I'm guessing assessed tend to be told to calm be repaired so what we do is we do at least the assessment for free\nAnd then maybe we say it is we're taking it to retire us so we take care of some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC company time have those skills\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repairs who've become cheaper and now for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to\nPay for the labor and labor is sex tiny so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that's labor she'd be tax lower so that's\nA professional repair which will become more attractive in in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their

that will be challenging but um maybe in the future you love that Christmas you\nOh yes I mean I think the future preparing cafes is as much around bringing people together\nAnd I think coming to RIMPAC cafe and it does create a sense of community that togetherness it cracked friendships hunting slow people down for a little bit while they actually learn a little bit about more about that

can say we are organized Asian which here's my view but we will print an equal number of articles with the opposite view\nRight but the ... a pretty one sided these days on me\nYeah the beer match you're right the ... more one sided that they made the case for leave and I think people believe debates is required if you're going to make a good decision\nAnd the debates is part of a democracy not everyone agrees with me over this late but you've got guys like Michael O'Leary\nWho's made us for his campaign in favor of remaining in the this is the head of Ryan and the head of ... in there\nAnd I think it's been accepted that Michael O'Leary says one thing to him says another but it's such a big existential questions for the economy that I think customers\nThe thing about breaks it that it was it it has become isn't it I mean a very divisive issue for many people suddenly for the people who feel strongly about that as he even just talk right now a ...\nSecond referendum next year which would perhaps be even more divisive could how would you go into that I mean again it would put you at all with a large subset presumably of your customers\nWell that's right I think it might put the adults with the subset of them I mean ultimately a rule was said to them look at the end of the day this is your decision it's a democracy that's what it's all about you decide what do I know but I think it's democracies at stake under very important\nIssues for ... for freedom the economy liberty and so on\nI think it's right that ... people speak out the public isn't stupid you know just cause I make the case for leave doesn't mean they they'll agree with me\nIs there any sign that it's a positive and I\nKnow which I think it's a good sign for democracy\nI'd be investors responds to you making this stand and and and making it said public and making it a part of your public experience\nWill investors or people of the highest principals ... share price goes up they'll stick with what you're saying I think\nHardly hurt anything for many investors there were one or two but a very small minority who complained that I think probably they were complaining 'cause they were remain as rather than the feeling that would damage the business itself\nIn supporting Colin Kaepernick or people started burning Nike shoes recently no one was burning Witherspoon spin that swear they\nWere probably some people who are ... cross but no it wasn't the most loyal as the burning of shoes that's for sure if I ... no ... no ... no [laughter]\nTimothy and founder of the u._k. pub and hotel chain J. D. but this being one of his stand was a personal one\nIt is perhaps as nothing compared to the brand advocacy adopted by the u._k. handmade cosmetics company lush founded by a group of business people in the Nineteen nineties who are already active campaign is on various issues\nLush has adopted an extraordinary range of campaigns promoting things like conservation animal welfare gay rights\nThings nothing to do with soap perhaps most controversial you they've attacked police operations wet offices I said to have said juiced activists in order to get inside campaign groups in Britain\n[laughter] thanks [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\nWell that campaign ... didn't stop and videos like this one defend them also put up a window displays in its doors with a mock up of a police officer in and out of uniform alongside the tagline paid to lie\nNot surprisingly this has caused some outcry not just from the police but also Britain's home secretary the thumb since bank down on his campaign ethics direct to Henry James admitted a bit of a mistake that but she said the campaigns will not about to stop\nObviously we took a huge amount to ... which you know I had a personal cost to Austin Austin that time it can't be she talked about in the u._k. ... admitted in talked about before so I guess that in some ways we just have to view the emotional impact on us as collateral damage to look good\nHave all kinds of campaigns not just that one of course campaigns ... animal testing you both campaigns are we at trends phobia fracking folks hunting new theory shoes plastic packaging the list goes on how does that relates to say\nTry not to relate to deciding both products\nBecause oldest I say she said you just mentioned the things that we will cap I'm passionately ...\nBefore we became a company that made so we were all campaign as an activist before\nWe came and went to a lush and that includes the people who started lush so obviously there's a whole host of things that we will care about and we built a business that suddenly became big enough that we could use all shop fronts on our website to actually talk about the\nThings that we were complaining about not private lives so for us that's a huge buying on those issues it's not marketing saying\nOkay so this is all just heartfelt stuff it's not anything to do you're saying with the commercial end of the business know how's it affected the commercial end of the business\nWe've central rule when he first started campaigning publicly that we would never on judge a campaign by its sales figures that we would never look to chew up at the same time because he would make you hesitate to have to win again so that little ... and we largely stick to it as\nEverybody wants to be right now how is it affects your say oh I can\nTell you they don't want to because actually surprisingly it puts sales up\nSo when the campaign people came to you saying that sales were this was during the spike ups campaign that was getting all the negative publicity\n[noise] uh yes yes during the spike up campaign and get it wasn't our campaigns people it was actually our accounts people came to us and you know made a phone call and said you know don't worry sales are actually up you're not going to believe this you know hang on in that\nBecause that because any news is good news\nI don't think it's cause any news is good news or I Would hope that what it was was a customer standing by us that they were really literally holding all hands through it and saying you know it's okay with you we know what you do we know why you do it and we're going to keep shopping with you know we don't care if you mess up and we don't care if you mess up sometimes\nI mean I I get what you're saying and I get the thing's a heartfelt and do you separate the two things I I suppose I'm Still slightly struggling to understand why you'd be bothered with even trying to sell soap or other products 'cause my sex if your campaigns are served as Britain have absolutely nothing to do with that I mean why marry the two in the first place\nI guess we marry the two because we've built this huge brand we're on high streets around the world and it would be almost rude not to allow the people that are working on the issues we care about access to science facility that we have built so you've got a platform we have a massive platform\nDo you think it is now we're living in an Arab perhaps where it's allowed for for corporate ... and ... to take a stand but he's more overtly controversial\nI Do think so yes I think that younger people coming up care about the things they care but they used to talking on line to other people who care about them and exchanging information and I think they won bronze to be ... to that\nWould you like the Nike I mean like Nike and you and what you're doing what she likes the other companies doing more of this activist campaigning and as part of the brand promotion\nI'd like to see companies take a look at the world see what's wrong do something about it in the supply chains do something about it in the way they interact with the world as well as\nIn the slick marketing I think it is more companies cat and actually you know walk the walk then a lot of us as consumers would be a lot happier say yes I'd like to see companies get involved", "year": "2018",
