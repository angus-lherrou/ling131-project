I came all bull to code is going on the late to legacy versions of pandemic [noise]\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules but then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precisely you're trying to write a book that's full casual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us is\nA this game as translate into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book who will send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\n... languages from other countries filtering ... game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you're like in Germany can't put it\nIf not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon put that on a cover you just won't sell it in Germany so it it'd be a thing of the culture you have to think of the language you have to think of how people played\nSo it's not kind of postal German fatigue with combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games why does it fit into what were called German games in the nineties and then Europe games which was this interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict\nTo design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else who said you sort of passively aggressively got in the place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically I'm taking anything from you know I just prevented you from getting something\nWhich on the surface is is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about four games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years just from the post war aversion to
