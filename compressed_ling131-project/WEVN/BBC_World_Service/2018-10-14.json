I've heard different um what I remember but my point is they told me to love\nAnd you haven't seen them since when I was five years old how did you lose contact\nI was born in a war country like last time my daughter was killed and my mom was well\nYou have a brother yeah and you thought page looking off to him\nAnd he was two years old\nOf guys you as a baby on the most important was finding food nothing else we will have to survive if we don't live to see the future we'll have to survive\nYou lost contact what happened\nIt was very difficult at some points and I decided to find that friends off my dodge way we used to go to a hung around with my dad so I went I left my bravo with them and I didn't tell them I have a plan to go somewhere else\nSo you were separated from your brother at the age of six yes he was to ... and up until very recently you haven't seen him again a tool you had no knowledge that he was still alive\nYeah um for some reason I had I had hope I say he is strong enough he will survive if you know strong like the way I struggle he'll be dead because a lot of kids died for hunger food and stuff like\nThat and yeah I Know there's been a miracle\nYeah it's hot enough to our state nine nine news and I look at him again it was kind of\nMiracle and him seeing may doesn't recognize me he said I don't know that guy how do you know this is your brother um somebody just contacted me because I'm I was trying to stay away a lot of 'em on the social media and stuff but not post myself because when I I I ...\nI got my professional contract football and a lot of people know about it and I stop posting pictures I said when I was six years old I lost my love this country and if anybody find a mile give him this amount of money and stuff like that there is that these will be available and then there is so many people contact me for different kids\nAnd then finally there is one password and who may shed and my mother's name correctly so I said he\nA test and then we did it confirmed yeah it was confirmed what how many ... moods I felt cold like very cold like up to inside my boy and it was cold and it was like okay\nThis is not true false I didn't believe you sick and things what I did is to get a flight the next day\nWell we'll see he was look at it in Uganda Kampala other strict cute as well and he finished to bring him to lump yes she is an hour away from me and he's leaving with me you know so what's that like after all this time [noise]\nVery nice feelings like there are very nice feeling this is the family that I was waiting for a long time\nAnd they've not even being living together for a week it was six days ago the arm it moved in to it smells ... he was a truly inspirational young man up with me in the studio rope till they Jay pulley and Ron I'm Michelle I'm rupture out\nYou can probably identify with that story because you were an undocumented immigrant\nI'm absolutely I left Liberia when I was six years old I'm moved to the United states to join my mother and my father and pretty much overstayed my visa and lived in undocumented man limbo from the time I was six until I was about Twenty years old so hearing that story what it really says to me is you know this sort of\nRacist than a phobic populist notions that are migrants are um a purge on society that they are swarm who come in and feed off a system finite resources for those who are not documented\nUm who are documented I should say it's just complete mess um this young man is a is emblematic of this year resilience and the great and the hard work\nThat migrants put in a many of them come from very difficult circumstances not for me I left Liberia before the war started but as a result of the war I had to remain in the United states and my parents showed me for almost fourteen years from that fourteen year armed conflict\nUm and as a result of that my parents had to work exceedingly hard um to pay for very exorbitant immigration fees to send me to private schools because public schools as too much questions about my status\nUm and so I think listening to this story should make a lot of us rethink our notions about migrants whether they be documented or undocumented that they actually contribute meaningfully to society um and that many of them come through very safe orderly in regular manners\nYeah he is achieved so much I mean so much more than most people will achieve and the whole large already and unease barely getting started Rona what did you make of that type\nI thought I mean ... it was an absolute inspiring story and in many ways very useful at this global moment when it seems that migration is almost always associated in news headlines with negative stories stories about\nThe exploitation or stories that migrants simply take away jobs from indigenous populations which of dislike self contradictory stories they come they speak truth at once\nAnd I think hearing it smells story mine just in fact we're not talking about a zero sum when migrants joined the community we're talking about a new contribution where the ... more than the sum of the whole\nThis particular story actually I think is interesting because of course he's gone on to imperial college London He's studying science and technology what are the areas where the country we're sitting the United kingdom desperately needs to develop new specialization is a new skill set in those terms it's very clear that smell and his brother I guess a contributing to something that this country really needs\nIs smell and Ahmed have

first book teach his children how not to be corrupt the second book jot it which means truthfulness honesty and integrity and my mother's best of language in Liberia\nIs an attempt to teach children

different they the Green Party they have two very charismatic leaders are they've gone and they worked very hard\nAnd um they're they're at their pro you know there are anti racist I mean I end up part of a large movement in Germany I mean there was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday to uh you know for tolerance they expect forty thousand people\nTurn up and two hundred and forty thousand people turned up\nSo they're they're pro tolerance or pro environment you know pro sort of a you know clean energy and and and they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country\nSo I think a lot of people are are more interested in that kind of humane politics I've also heard people say you know at that mean that they see a few times for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they miss the humane policy and politics that used to be and not those parties\nIt's interesting isn't it there's a migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\n[noise] and it's because that migration has since two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided that the ah the country it's divided the way people think there are a lot of people who don't want people coming in to people who are\nDoing very well particularly pensioners is also another issue in the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch\nAnd they don't know why people are coming in and taking their money so they [noise] they're also worried about loss of\nAnd there there's a sense of ... you know their culture\nAnd they're afraid at part of the thing that the state said they're against and immigration particularly from Islamic countries on to this is a theme with a lot of people who are worried about the uh the flavor and the color on defense of their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope Cho\nJust looking back to that report from James no country from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows just sticking with the topic of immigration looks at the last speaker and that was George I do know founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas you grew up in the United states as a migrant well she'll\nThat I did I thought it was particularly ridiculous I mean quite often migrants or people who have migrant I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls and detentions to ensure that those people from across\nIn Mexico don't come over just made me think\nYou know the complicity of all of us in these discussions um and the fact of the matter is you know border controls high borders detentions actually create more climbed a sign forms of migration where people feel like they have to go to\nSmugglers and people who engage in class time forms of migration I'm an income um and and you're creating an opportunity for migrants to ... to be at more danger um so I just I just found that it was quite interesting that this you know I'm Latino Republican so harsh\nAbout migrants coming from from Mexico when in actuality that's the same rhetoric the same race is sort of xenophobia grabbing rhetoric that Donald Trump has enabled across across the United states\nI don't I don't know why this happened because you're you're right I've heard this perspective before why would someone with it you just saw an understanding of the issues that immigrants face what why would they moved to that kind of I think what's\nInteresting is that the divide and conquer the divide and rule sort of a you know notions across the ... have done a fund I had made a fundamental impact on how people see this us and us and them kind of perspective so migrants who assimilate into places like the United states\nUm tend to be very wary of those who are coming across the border um because the senses you know there's a finite set of resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who look like me I'm may some sometimes subtle that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic citizens but those who can't have migraine ... which for me it's very warm psychologically but that's that's the way the world\nAround them is it your professor of history and politics of modern China just how big an issue\nIs immigration and China will the really big issue there is no immigration the sense of people from outside China coming in but internal migration something like a hundred and fifty to two hundred million people I mean you know the size of more than most European countries\nEssentially moved from their home villages throughout China to build buildings work on high speed railways and essentially provide the labor ...

World Service with me I like ... Germany's foot bowling side has continued they've lost free now to the Netherlands that six that fate in ten games Alistair Ross joins me from ... how much pressure is that for a change of manager\nHow you ask a question of first defeats the metal and since Nineteen Ninety two first time ever that Germany has gone three games without scoring that bought some of the three team European nations league with two matches to go I'm facing a trip to world champions from snakes so\nGiven this all comes off they finished Baltimore if that group for the world cup of coffee angry and very public international retirement of ...\nDespite the fact that he's won the world cup on a confederation scalp and his twelve years in charge manager your love knows the pressure to perform is growing\nVoluntarily just see if we talk on the heart and disappointing managed to lose three mill in the first few minutes we have control and created a few Chong says\nI'll biggest problem is that we're not taking them the situations that word wedding training didn't work in the ... just disappointing the way we played in the last ten minutes when we can see the two goals at this level by shouldn't happen\nSo I was an amount of hours in\nThe first thing that was the big match in Europe on Saturday and the Africa Cup of nations qualifiers and ball boys to one way in the Congo amount of gas cars will know when a white at equitable real guinea provided the shocks while much area and South Africa ... posted a very big wins\nThey put themselves in prime position now to be the two sides to qualify from groups\nPay and internal should we be surprised that Roger Federer has failed to make\nWill be surprised to Roger Federer ever loses the match but it will just fast event since the U.S with a month ago so in that sense perhaps not but being in the semi final against the Twenty one year old who never reached the final Adam officer vent before federal was all basically going to be the favorite in the end up on a charge\nPosted I surprised six four six four when he spoke to his final place against ... joke of age but federal though still happy with how he's performed in Shanghai unhappy\nHow the body is held this week I feel like I'm explosive out there I'm returning well and they're serving to you know I think it's it's okay could be even a little bit better um I don't think that played a match where I didn't get broken so that's something [noise]\nBut it's more unusual for me but um this week I felt like I was hitting the ball well and I think that's something that I can definitely take along with me\nOn that final charge against jock itch gets underway in around two hours type\nAlistair Ross thank you very much you're listening to weekends from the b._b._c. World Service ... from my guests Ron I mentioned professor of history and politics of Martin China and Rob tell ... Haley Liberia and also and academic and writes a book about corruption\nThe children this weekend from the b._b._c. World Service the news is next\nYou're listening to an HP are where support comes from you our listeners and from the elm street group at Morgan Stanley delivery innovative solutions for\nClients wind personal values with their financial goals\nStreet group at Morgan Stanley dot com\nAnd from Daniels restaurants have cynical overlooking the ... river casual dining with find food freshly prepare from locally sourced ingredients information at Daniels of panic or dot com [noise]\nSounds of a suit in the middle east the texture of a voice from a small town in Arkansas we take you to places and to meet people who are familiar but we're also surprising artist thinkers dreamers movers and shakers here and from all over the world I knew the scene of our host of weekend edition Sunday join us for a journey\nTo come in here yeah I mean I'm Glad that you brought those up because those examples up because I mean although Transparency International has a corruption perception index with with which looks mostly at corruption perceptions\nUm the United nations economic commission for Africa is actually looking at illicit financial flows particularly from the continent of Africa you've gotten billions and billions and billions of dollars that leave the confidence through\nYou know invading taxes through transfer pricing I'm mostly from polar foreign multinationals and you have you know the the wiki leaks are all these leaks that are coming out that are um exposing these sort of higher level multinational flows of of corrupt practices\nUm and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index\nWhich is more evidence spaces more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be Transparency International should be thinking about looking at those evidence based forms of measuring corruption Rona\nYou mentioned corruption in Africa or the other the second biggest economy in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that was what you mean China that rocking story I did meet John it you\nKnow I think one of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days has been one of the series of high profile arrest this time ... away who was the head of into polish people being picked up at the airport in Beijing and now charged with bribery\nAn innocence what China's been doing particularly the last year will say with the setting up with something called the national see position commission is what you might call empty transparency there's this huge crackdown it's very much to put\nA little ... state very little openness about what's going on you can be held on the up to six months I think without access to a lawyer and especially be putting the frightened as a large numbers of wealth people don't just officials but movie stars even the same as Chinese movie star who was\nHidden away for three months until she came out from the Greeks packs us tax\nI'm Wondering what the effectiveness actually ease of this kind of very state driven very author or Terry and kind of anti corruption move and whether or not it's terrifying but effective or actually if it's just simply the wrong way to go to\nCasey well from my size or I I think in part to our atmosphere [noise] Casey this is about ... can you hear me just try again yeah\nAmnesty International called ... ... the national supervision finishing the systematic threat to human rights in China which we agree with that ...\nPeople without trial without access to a lawyer for six months for having an organization that you can't appeal higher than the Supreme Court is probably not the way to go Francisco ... I'm\nSorry I think the ... little cut off here\nYeah it it it's not the best I was a question or a few um and in fact Rob till\nWe have so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of United States the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world does it work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there's a small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer uprising or less a financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences in ...\nBeyond just moving around the changing the practice of corruption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe so that people really face the full weight of the long\nRun up and I think it's very important that liberal governments\nExercise that kind of transparency and the anti corruption because if you don't have that kind of effect of anti corruption it opens up the uh the waterfront for countries like China to say well actually our anti liberal and in many ways very known transparent ways of cracking down on corruption a more effective and the liberal will have to have an answer to that\nWe're having all sorts of trouble with ... and a half to say goodbye to our friends from Amnesty International but I thought of as a a newspaper article written that you've written a in front of me here and this is well this is corruption automate just go buy a movie star in China just tell me a ...\nThat's right ... it's in this morning's London Sunday Times and it's basically about funding being the single most famous movie star will celebrity in China sixty million followers on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter\nAnd she disappeared in July reappeared on E. three months later and very mysterious circumstances with a tax bill\nFor a hundred and twenty nine million US dollars which is almost as high as a BBC present the salary I Believe yeah but I ...

Party government on not just corruption but actually political opposition as well so the two things come together\nAnd that enabled by one very interesting phenomenon which is really big in China the growth of alteration intelligence ... so\nThe state is using tech for surveillance in China much more than any other government in the world you might say it's almost a kind of trial run for us all to surveillance state in which everyone's behavior is going to be monitored they'll have little ID cards and on those not just the financial details or your rent\nA criminal record but also things that you do in the neighborhood may be recorded so\nThere's a real social change happening in China this anti corruption story is just one poll to that\nBecause I read an extraordinary thing on the news

earlier in the program about your research on race based immigration in some West African countries how much debate do you see about this in the country is concerned\nWell it's race based citizenship causes so the countries Liberia and Sierra Leone which I'm or formerly um slave sort of a slave history with those two countries where former I'm ... from the United states and Britain Kamen founded these countries as a form of\nEnabling black people to own the means of production and running their own state of affairs um and so the two countries have re citizenship clauses that basically stay only people of negro descent so effectively black people can be citizens of Liberia and Sierra Leone\nUm and what's fascinating for me about this historically is that you know the Westphalia and his thumb says or or or sort of use whiteness as a reference for citizenship white and it's a male and as a reference for citizenship but what these countries are effectively doing and you can debate whether or not it's right or wrong is that they're\nCensoring blackness as a reference for citizenship and for me this is an incredibly revolutionary\n... gun nothing else who was an eyewitness\nI was sitting at the archbishop speech with my tape recorder that he has the now and then and then suddenly almost at the end of the time there was the sound like a huge explosion I saw in Seoul

protected by an amnesty law after the Nineteen Ninety to peace agreement I spoke to the American journalist gene Columbus in South south at all\nIt's mainly an atmosphere of great joy and celebration they're having two major celebrations tonight\nIn different places one being that gets the jewel downtown where he gave those Sunday homily that made him so famous the other is the little chapel\nOn the grounds of the hospital for people with terminal cancer which was the place where he chose to live as archbishop and it's the place where he was murdered while saying mass one night\nThat will be people who've never heard of Oscar Romero who is why she sat important\nHe was the archbishop here in St toddler the capital from Nineteen Seventy seven to Nineteen eighty and these were the years just before\nThe twelve year civil war broke out here and he\nWas he was really be loved and\nRespected because he spoke out very strongly about injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up\nCosting does life he was shot to death the day after he gave a Sunday sermon directing themselves specifically\nTo the members of the armed forces and saying to them you do not have to obey and immoral ordered to go out and and kill people and that did not go down well with some of the authorities so who killed him\nWell it was for the most part\nPeople from you know on the government's thought the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point out that there was a growing leftist movement\nHere then surely grew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed human rights abuses archbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so he was even handed\nIf you will you make a mistake and are you do something wrong and you could count on him\nOliver and Sunday no matter what your political position was\nHis killers have never been brought to justice why not\nWell for a long time after the war ended in Nineteen Ninety two there was an amnesty law and with that the case couldn't go anywhere now the country's Supreme Court has overturned that and the law and\nActually this week in Rome the leader of the Catholic Church cardinal roast the child has has said he thinks it's really important that there be a trial because he says the wounds from the war has never healed and the only way for them really to heal\nIs for the country to find out what the truth really was about his assassination and then for justice to be applied\n[noise] that was journalist gene Columbus speaking to me from El Salvador [noise]\nI have a three thousand people have signed a petition opposing a planned statue of ... county in Malawi commercial capital plant the candy muscle group climb now suddenly that the Indian independence here I did nothing for the south and African countries they accused him of being a racist\nJimmy Kenya teaches media and communications at the University of Malawi and told me why he backed this cool\nGotten to a head north to Malawi has no connection to countries in Africa and if anything in the least is that have been a few publications about questioning his stance on Africa and Africans are getting about eight or is one way or the other areas\nYou know a lot of people will be quite surprised to hear this but except perspective that say much in recent years what is the evidence ... being a racist [noise] when\nYou look at the relations in Malawi has quite a large Indian community and the most of them run businesses and they are business owners and there's always been sort of conflict between\nIndia and business owners and allow in ... as the Indian Malawi doesn't leave him ... doesn't really socialize with a list or that why the Muslim community so from my perspective as a context to that argument\nAnd yet there is a significant Indian community in Malawi ... and as you've said you have the Indian government building this conference center [noise]\nHe is the point from in the gum and perspective is more or less like how they argued in gonna win a gun in government was forced to take it starts to get my to my gun from the rest of the argument was that it has been sort of cardio relationship and has been good\nA diplomatic relations between that country in India the same argument that I was being made in Malawi and here we're talking about is\nThat you something that is going to stand in the middle or might always commercial capital wouldn't it be a sign of tolerance if you want to have this statute build a sign up not always moved on\n... years you could argue from that perspective but then when they begin to think about what a structure stunts voice completely different thing by I've started basically you're attending future generations under current generations that here's somebody that I Do my ... it'd be\nSo if not Mahatma Gandhi who would you like to have a statue of\n... so it's good for for me just to name one pill so and but I think it would I Would do something about the strategy for these shows are examples were fired general Sheila ... who is one of those pardon the eyes of an phone you're struggling this country he had to British national ...\nYes but this is actually happening ... people are struggling and be points out maybe pretty much every country like I'll give it to something but it wouldn't be looking for something\nTo me Ken yeah from the University of Malawi statues are a bunch of things on a I'm Brooke ... absolutely I think what's interesting about this case is it really it comes out of this out\nAcross the continent where people are looking at colonial structures\nBe they buildings or names of streets I'm ... and just recently changes named ... me to go back to the indigenous name 'em and even the rose must fall movement at the University of Cape Town with black students talked about it pits that make violence um whereas you know racist policies across the university\nNeeded to move this uh the statue of suffer road to the sinister colonialists I'm across the southern African region so I think\nIt it's it's a bigger kind of conversation that's happening across the continent in academics basis but also at national level\nRound the U.S needs to that to what did you make of it\nWell first of all the uh the the speakers what's that going to\nCampaign to have the name of the city a blonde time change 'cause I think that's an alternate ditched his name but I'd say there's two reasons why respectfully I Would completely disagree with his position the first one is that he said that Gandhi has nothing to do with Africa in fact ... having spent large parts of his life in South Africa\nAcross the whole of Africa in Kenya in South Africa and elsewhere\nIndian communities would deeply involved with liberation movements the African National Congress cause very closely involved with the Indian National Congress which for independence to India\nAnd remembering the liberation was cosmopolitan existed across confidence not just within Africa within India is very important and the second even more important reason is to do with non violent resistance that was gone these great contribution to independence movements the idea of mass\nKnown violence in our current terribly violent era I think that's the contribution that's well worth making of course ... they had some reprehensible views when he was younger he moved completely ... against those when he was older\nAnd rejected cost racism and so forth so understanding how ... developed means that they're not saying that human beings who deserve respect and gum the has much to say Africa as great African leaders like Monday law have to the entire world\nIs interesting isn't it though how one person can be viewed differently in two different places ten seconds each\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you know I hear the the points that are taken I think the the concerns across ... how we are um are valid again coming out of this de colonial sort of an African is anti racist movement um but yes you're you're absolutely right that that's the power perspective isn't it\nRun a ten seconds from you I Would say the ... and ... should be placed on around the world and plenty of other figures too about\nThe

isn't it\nYou with yeah just to see that just just to see\nHow comfortable which is like a lot when I Want us to come to it I think is similar to wishing able to somebody you know you're not going to be able to actually change their lives and bring them something about just by thinking about that but would you want to it so easy for me to just not do that I'd rather just to\nJust not do that you don't have to know what I keep thinking about that\nIs very common ritual magic and this is a real emotional thing to do and when you do in the magic I'm your these psychological changing something\nAnd thanks to Sophie page ... thanks to my easily inclined to produce ... for that mean trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was even though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on ... how can something that we know isn't true still have an impact on the way we behave and to Jane rise and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo whether these superstitious or a true to kind of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological processed cheese and those are functional and they exist for reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example who are always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being caused really related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense or another example is the way that he respects or sort of the rules of thumb that our mind will rely on so\nIt's a a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are\nRecent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program ... there was a bit in the museum about voodoo and um but producing a very cruel he brought along some pictures of my some loved ones and I was asked if I Would like cutting them up or just a she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with the bad outcome of anything but I mean to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between\nTwo things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too\nWas sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates very quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources or sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition and the slower process\nCan then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air and what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case\nSometimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintained that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment I Want you to imagine this I have three of our lives on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three\nChosen okay good now you can keep your ... or you can swap it for the remaining two envelopes what\nDo you go full you should go for the\nTwo [laughter] there is no question here rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade their ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up\nWhile thought the same like a really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice the between the tuition and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and sometimes the rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first ... system just because just because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that intuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not the rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it\nSo another thing to consider is the cost of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs explain my experience with the ... so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi irrational person on the radio\nBut the cost of ignoring the intuition that I see this is going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one that's a big cost so I'd rather avoid not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying at\nI mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining it as a possibility Jane rise in the\nAre listening to crowd sons on the b._b._c.

because we use and Utah\nEurope has been on the path of integration for a long time starting from the European coal and steel community and culminated in the form of the European Union leader who could have lost and I feel like why so I Believe in order to establish a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula\nWill eventually need to establish a north East Asian multilateral peace and

I Do believe that the human rights of the people in North Korea is a very important issue and I believe that North Korea needs to work towards the path of universal human rights\nAt all or economics\nI Do believe that promotion of human rights\nThrough international pressure is not very effective and in order to achieve substantive improvements in the human rights of the north Korean people we need to engage in inter Korean cooperation as less cooperation between ... and the international society can you\nGo to a ball or\nGo we also need to nudge North Korea towards the past of
