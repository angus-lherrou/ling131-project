century Fox's nine to five directed by calling Higgins film comedy about a sexist boss who gets his come up and\nThe theme ... couldn't be more timely which is why the film made nearly forty years ago is being released again here in the u._k.\nThe producer and one of its stars Jane Fonda you've heard just they're planning to follow up because the me too era of Hollywood needs no reminding of course of the allegations face by film producer Harvey Weinstein allegations he denies\nThe BBC's Moffat county has been discussing these issues with Jane Fonda she began by asking how she first got the idea for the film nine to five which also stars Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton\nOne of my friends was an organizer of when an office workers [noise] she would tell me stories about the kinds of things that they were facing is that they had to put up with and finally one day I said I Want to make a movie about this and then was my idea to cast ...\nHow much convincing did they take a year\nTo convince ... to be in a movie which is pretty amazing given that nobody ever had Dolly in a movie before\nLooking back on the film I think it stood the test of time\nThe issue with me too movement which began just about a year ago is very much front and center and of course nine to five very much dealt with the issues of sexual abuse but not just that also the fact that uh the character played by Lily Tomlin would train\nHer and the salary differential was dealt with so plenty of material and when it comes to making a seat for which you and looking into yeah well it's different now in a way it's worse the sexual harassment still exist\nThe men being promoted past women still exists but now many of the workers will be\nSubcontracted which means that where do they go when their wages stolen by their boss or do they go with their fired because they're pregnant so we need a new movie whether the script will turn out I don't know I hate to get my hopes up too much\nAnd when in the wake of Harvey Weinstein in the allegations that came out about him did not present personal dynamics for you about whether to speak household knows\nNo I've never had too many difficulties speaking out\nWhat was important for me me too was the survivor's coming forward and telling their stories and being believed the time's up movement is now what are we going to do about it\nLike having more women on boards of directors having women and more positions of power but right at the beginning of time's up we in Hollywood received a\nA wonderful letter from seven hundred thousand women farm workers you know it was really dear sisters we understand what you were talking about and rising up about we deal with it every day in the fields\nAnd it was a transformative moment and a lot of us realize that if the time's up movement is going to be successful in the long run we have to stand shoulder to shoulder with our sisters that are less visible it's even harder for them to speak up because they will definitely lose their jobs\nI had read that do you yourself have known some of the allegations about ... cats but hadn't spoken out to them\nWell no you can't it's the survivor that had to speak because this was before it became public that Rosanna told me her experience and\nThe experience of other women as well and but she was too scared to come forward but she knew that it had affected her career that she had rebuffed him but I I couldn't override her and speak\nDo you think that the whole controversy around Brett Kavanaugh and his appointment as the Supreme Court justice do you think that that can be seen in the context of the me too movement in the sense that Christine Blasey Ford has self was willing to come forward and speak about it\nWell Anita Hill came forward and spoke

a traditional Islamic culture\nWith which had been suppressed to a large degree by the communists allow that\nVery recently was suppressed people were banned from having long beards and and Vermont and Islamic traditional dress but that's all changed has\nIt really it is because the bat the motivations for those that banning we're still communist and that the religion was seen as a threat\nOr budge what you now have is of an an allowance and increase the freedom of religion but with this threat being imported into those countries from abroad to the extremist threat so how do they allow\nFreedom of religion without a line moves freedom MOOCs treatment some of the challenge they face\nAn end to be fair I think some very very intelligent people trying to address this um and the

Ashraf are our guests here on weekend\nLet's focus on this now because each day the political divide in America\nGets wider it's a fairly well worn phrase that now politicians pouring scorn on each other and the president repeating his dislike for the media not everyone would have filled the atmosphere would become so ten cents so aggressive it it would inspire apostle bombing campaign\nWell actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy so the democracy park refers to people voting but the liberal part refers to the rule of law to\nA framework of constitutional checks and balances that make sure that what the people choose doesn't churn eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power and that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people voted in a way that you'd approval\nNo I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law\nYou know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us\nWhat linked D.C between demanding dignity and identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized\nAnd that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that\nA dignity we want the society to acknowledge that\nWe are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender the ethnicity the race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that's propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you know so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nUh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and\nPeople that came later a including you\nAre really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us I suspect that she doesn't literally mean the descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way\nAre somehow you're not part of the national community\nAnd by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I was born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this was really an option for me now that will be people all over\nPopulist leaders like Viktor Orban in Hungary who you mentioned in your book I'm like the alternatives for Germany movement but you also mentioned that will be loads of people who who who listen to you and think\nWhat a Californian view you know what a liberal Californian view your day mate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened by these people that are you say her you know not for me and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIf a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is Chrissy an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um\nThe Justice Department and I think that if he gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts him dependence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity that demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black\nIt's really interesting isn't it because they talk about democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise to democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes but we've got in the middle ground it doesn't feel as if we've got anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other in the same in the same set a sentence\nSo identity politics it's really ... shifting sons in terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme\nAnd people gravitate towards the middle where we find unhappiness with it and therefore I won't say effectively have the freedom to go back to the extremes which then become\nHow much in isolation and that comes to brand new motion effectively in politics is really interesting do you have political beliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show my identity is that it's a multi faceted and so my political beliefs but I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think France is\nSo key albums has stunted the debate which I Hope will be ... by people more widely\nOne of the assumptions has been that um the end of history that doesn't western liberal democracy is the way forward we are not going to go any ... ... ... it's not going to go away\nWithout even though he knew who indeed and history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date and if it is if we do think it's the best system than we need to understand it in ... and ... and change it to the manager will fashion\nThe tension that sue spoke about essentially the tension between the value system of liberalism and the democracy bed which says a ordinary people decide what they want\nNow the value system a it is possible the system\nFrom which the ordinary people are often divorced ordinary people the people that suffer economic deprivation most that feel disenfranchised from the legal system and the ... and it is these these people that are ... by extremists politicians who are anti democratic in the longer term\nSo we do have a a big issue here which does need to be addressed and thought about but much more widely than academics it needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and ... but in a democratic system otherwise it's very French one\nProblem assume we're wrapping up the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy in the ... which is\nFine as lots of ... up you know there isn't a passion surrounding the parents of liberal democracy is a ... um and I think that's part of the problem the fire comes in the extremes and the damn pens as we go towards the middle ground which is actually viewed as being a safer ground\nAnd that's the ground you stand on ... [laughter] regardless Ashraf ... black have\nBeen a guest on this edition of weekend many thanks to them hope you come back again soon\nAnd thanks to you for listening we'll we can we live from London misses the b._b._c.

Will Stone altering but what we can say is that hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yet\nUm why should that be a limit if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways of replacing bones and grabbing new bones if necessary why why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on all buddy for instance maybe I'll bones just a destined to crumble after such an age old\nMay be the right to which uh we can replace me cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I Would say that was quite theoretical and there's no sign of that happening yet\nThanks class now that I was saying when we discuss life expectancy a couple of weeks ago it was Spain that came out on top with the U.S lower down in the lists than you might expect a lot of the

recent airstrikes in a place called die young and the province of ... in the north which is a who's the stronghold\nAnd that was where forty two school boys were killed on a boss\nWe met some of the survivors we met their parents we went to the school we saw the empty desks we saw the new grave yard full of children's bodies the empty graves that are waiting for the remains of children that still have not been identified two months on\nAnd there are many who are asking if there's another Saturday airstrikes actually amount to a war crime so it's a deeply damaging inexpensive conflict for Saudi Arabia and there's no indication that they have any exit strategy they're all\n... million people in Yemen facing found them in twenty eight to and what did you see there\nHad an opportunity over a period of about two weeks to see the scale of the ...\nTrip but I hadn't been in Sana'a in the capital in two years\nI did was really shocking to see how much things have deteriorated there has been a massive cholera epidemic the largest recorded in the world and not nutrition rights have soared there are four hundred thousand children in Yemen now who are severely acutely malnourished\nOn during our trip we met the un humanitarian coordinator for Yemen leaves Gran day and she was very very\nBlunt and dark and her warning that up to fourteen million people could be suffering famine within a few months if there is no political solution and under certainly isn't too on on the horizon\nAnd also the aid agencies able to do at the moment to look to they think needs to happen now\nI mean one thing you hear from the aid agencies on from Yemeni doctors and indeed yeah many civilians the messages is really the same from everyone at the end the conflict what we need is the end to the conflict\nAnd the great fear is around the red sea port of data that's in the hands of the who the rebels there has been an offensive since about June ...\nBy the Saudi led coalition on on the various forces that support the government of Yemen the un and the ... are desperately concerned that any attempt that results and fighting and the port\nWould be catastrophic because the data really is the lifeline about eighty percent of Yemen's age food supplies fuel medicine this coming in through a day to\nThe UN is managing to operate their other organizations like save the children and so on they need permission from the two sides it's not always easy to get their operations are controlled and limited but undoubtedly it is the operation of of the aid agencies better thing keeping so many Yemeni is alive during the years of this conflict\nOn the air in the U.S is warming so rapidly that most experts agree that measures need to be taken to suck carbon dioxide out to the atmosphere\nTo avoid the consequences of climate change budding fossil fuels for energy clearing forest some demotion wetlands oh contribute to the problem [noise] CO two stops heat from leaving the planet one reason why the average temperature is higher than it used to be\nScientists in the U.S now say that some technology able to capture compound is ready to be deployed on a large scale right now\nSo is this a solution to climate change I all star environment correspondent McGraw\nThe problem with these techniques that they talked about here is uh nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of these scientists and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told and everybody had some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices brothers would be boring things more ... and do things where you've got these machines that looked like washing machines which fans in the midst of carbon out of the year\nThey can do that right now they cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they remove but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove common mountains there why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers the politicians and campaigners environmental is really worried about because people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the truck they'll keep flying they'll keep using me to keep driving cars to do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is carbon capture happening\nAppealing yeah other lots of different things going on at the moment every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do far station that the\n... lengthen the time to time the trees grow or they changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something they plan pretty quickly the bigger more technical industrial challenge of you know holding on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice was literally a handful around the world and the big problem with that because all these big bits of case cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hands in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report that's come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands Neal to see if you can protect those there may using source of our sing for common they soak up more carbon than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton of carbon and that is really really cheap the bigger problem of course long terms we don't have enough of them you know the ... the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice people wants to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the games are making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller take is happening and it's cheap and what this report things we do more but how do you\nIncentivize countries such as China countries such as India which has been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture yeah\nBoth China and India are taking a lot of these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that are also obviously building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief amongst richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it\nThen there'll be able to either share that technology with India and China nothing really happened so far and there are a number of intellectual property questions about all the the big challenges with China and India they remain on salt at this point\nNot look around that's it from the well this week for now don't forget to join us at the same time

very important the company says a hundred and twenty million people use what's up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million\nIt has become in Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them\nOne hypothesis is that this happens because of how ... networks offer what's up for free without discounting the Internet data so\nIt's it's a cheap and readily available to and how is it being abused during the present and elections\nSo we found out that there are ... teams that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook\nAnd then you these numbers to a target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can to send the message is individually about candidates or when they put people in lots of groups one market here who I spoke to was\nTelling me he would put a a a person and a group\nAnd the group would have a name that is not related to a candidate specifically like political debate and then people would start talking\nBut there were would be to uh people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to lead these people on and make them support the candidate and this is just\nA little fringe activity or is that an overload of this happening while we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used\nBy different candidates in Brazil and different parties lots of different parties\nAnd it was up has played a big part in

on going on in its own was Facebook isn't it Facebook's role in this because of course I mean what was that just keeps on ... ringing the alarm bells and they don't seem to be able to do much about it\nWell it sounded to be learning about is coming from all the tea is actually but it got fashionable two years ago for various reasons yes I I think it is and it was introduced in the same problem which is\nHow our politicians today again to get their message across to people on campaign the way that we'll socially interact now he's completely tied up with social media say oh the snake the politicians are going to do that and then you get these questions why did they get the data Halladay targeting paper the messages\nAre I think things have ... ... but he is having conversations if he
