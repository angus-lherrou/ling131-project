but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have the same day registration it leads to irrational voting Brian Robinson is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house brands he's voting as a writer and a privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says\nBrian thanks registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate a bit I Try to how does it

elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really

but even if you get into the booth your vote might not be properly County Georgia is one of five states that rely solely on touch screen voting machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts have warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOne of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting it's called paper not highly complex computers paper\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for ... to target county Web sites in Georgia\nA lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to hacking Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country but are the people in charge of elections there actually listening reveals by Duncan picks up the story [noise]\nYeah so uh right now I'm In the machine in Logan lamb has a voting machine in his living room [noise] this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out the touch screen voting machines she has is the kind of Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen\nIt looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and a Bible Logan boots it up\nSo it was actually touch litter and then it became pressing the image is one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that little chime at the beginning and use that as my ... came\nTo this is a direct recording electronic machine or ... it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity types that is a major red flag\nIn fact dairies had been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines as paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record of whether you believe the continued use\nOf paper less voting machines in this country\nThreatens our national security\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly met Bernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan\nHe studied the arteries and their vulnerability\nThat says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you're injecting prevention or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of this treaty the way it's set up is that that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the ...\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day\nYou at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic one for the midterm elections\nJudge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian Kemp she wrote that switching to a paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's pace in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system\nBy the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of that hacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they demean as paranoia the research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert [noise]\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems and machines but very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nThe people I talked to said that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw states\nWe know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the Russians are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question\nLet me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\nReveals by Duncan brought us that story\n\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp Savage to commission that look at options for replacing the curve voting system by twenty twenty oh and the other four states heading into the midterms they use touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a
