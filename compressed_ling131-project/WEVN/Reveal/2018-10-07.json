did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nIt's not so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law it's called the habitual offender statue and usually you don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flood of sodas\nAnd the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon can is arrow uses the law to hammer them busy\nBernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana has one of the strongest repeat offender laws in the U.S and in New Orleans that can now put a man in prison for a possible Twenty years to life for stealing candy bars Kobe Bryant [noise]\n\nI've never met Conrad son prince in person but we talk on the phone and say that again\n[noise]\nPrinces and a jail that's over five hours from New Orleans where he's from the phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and nice and spends his days along with over a hundred other men we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out [noise]\n\nBut my hair down did you say [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo he's what does the d._a. have to say about that\nWell the d._a. promised me an interview for this story but he never gave it to me\nI asked over and over and each time he declined\nBut I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom the first person used to work for Kennedy era as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson to how long were you a da\nAnd regular here's a seven years but in ... and feels like an attorney\nThompson worked for Ken is arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office use the habitual offender statue back then\nMountains and on and on point nine percent of the time I mean it was just there was a standard was even lower her office for lack of a better way of describing it was the way it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that that too often are statutes it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statue is as a tool like a ranch or a hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like the tennis arrow never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere is as mines that are the more before we lock 'em in the more time that we give people the more we're going to stop the crime problem punished farmers from his point of ... you know harsh sentences or the time\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says can is there a ... office still uses the habitual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at is the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your choir started anyway you talk to the prosecutor and to the judge it's even a consideration for the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments\nOf your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge Orleans Parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it\nWith this little light black or right this is a life like there's a lot of heavy but\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of this law\nTakes away poses Palmer functions of a judge which is to fashion a sense is that some focus just simply for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the vigil offender statute judges no longer decide how long the person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kicking the judge has no choice\nIf I have someone who has mental health issues or drug abuse issues I warn that treatment aspect to conform to be part of the sentence with the digital feathers that says if I got as soon as the twenty twenty five years that will be there no taxes\nFor someone just to go away in ... [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da da\nNang minutes away just up the Mississippi River the populations of east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black their da ... ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just likely on Canada's arrow\n... oh you did you ever been to San jose oh wow I'll be going on ... street\nHell or more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is there it was private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da for a decade\nYou know for me others will soon as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything there's public safety can you ... with no charm a Jew or does public safety really demand ...\nAnd the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times\nNow let's talk about what ... does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Canada zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times [laughter]\n[noise] I shared this number with the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have a I never heard back\nAnd an email the DEA spokesman said the office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\nThe reason these two da's ... so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom\nLine is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already ... [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nFrom what you're saying it's like ... has the power to selectively enforce the law\nIs in a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nRemiss if I had what I consider to be a prosecutor case and simply said I'm not going to prosecutors because I just don't agree with the law that truly my call for you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not that\nIs the law I think I have a responsibility to prosecutors if the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n... is I'm just doing my job why does he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is Ken Israel's than\nI Am a\nCoal criminal law specialist\nAnd I heard that really you go by Becky\nBig you would do a ... a ...\nYou know this is monitored them among war room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stacked by his computer taped to the walls this is where a biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\nBecause the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing this but when Harry counting came into office\nWill will will will will wait wait wait wait wait a minute you did did you just say Harry Cohn exists the jazz singer no that's a junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry ... senior\nWhen Harry counting came into office he use multiple below two shows up in this issue of society that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of it as\nKind of course the d._a. of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney Eric ... to use the powers of hers offer to help ... system but time and time again returned habitual offenders to continue their own inhibited crimes against decent citizen [noise]\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime was surging all over the country people were scared\nSounds like kind of played on that fear so he brought this law back from when ... when did you start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any first shot a third time being convicted of any prying you shall be considered as I'm it's just a ... a labor for life\nSince this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that ... really came in their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speaks to imagining that the conflict I was a scary African American that\nThe kind of man who can never be rehabilitated in a penitentiary\nHere saying that they would change the charge so that they could then employee the multiple bell curve exactly and there was no record of this\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal ... negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the da and ever officially charges the habitual offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know Ken is there a use the law in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg\n[laughter]\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story which is frustrating because he's an elected official but he did offer a statement about princes case\nHere a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert voluntarily entered into a plea agreement and received\nA legal sense under Louisiana law if he believed himself not guilty he could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial ... said my hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself and eradicate his\nSubstance abuse issues while in prison\n\nAfter I requested to interview ... he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat addiction our connection was in grade\n[noise] when did you do the first one [noise]\nSo that was like six years and years\n[noise]\nPrint said it took awhile for him to enter a program because they didn't really have programs [noise]\n\nJust wasting time sitting in one dormitory with a hundred and twenty people doing nothing\nSince seven years he's got three to go has anything changed for you\nLove so much lower so we're ... we're all those little retreat over ... ... ...\nThere is a little work out\nA few times now prince has asked me to give a message to his oldest son prince junior these jobs are expensive and his son can always afford them anyway prince asks me to tell us on he
