[noise]\n\nAnd I'm here or not but how safe for the story that is so small it almost feels wrong to tell it in a room this ground\nIt's actually about a real opera singer not a super famous upper singer or anything like that person go free makes about half of our living singing the other half she makes a recording audio books\nAbout a year ago she was staying at a hotel\nAnd she had a deadline on his children's book that she was supposed to be recording and hotel room was kind of noise is using a lot of noise from the street as a shield river Kwai places you went into the causes put pillows all around to dead and the sound sound before with microphone and then the court and the microphone\nUh went under the door of the closet out to her laptop because her laptop had a fair that made noise\nThat's what causes the door so it's pitch dark except for the light from her eye pad which had the text of the book that she was supposed to read that you began\nBe exciting exploits an effort ... else written by Tricia sugar wreck and married it by kind guilty\nChapter one way or is Anna the enchanted\nForest was deep and green and splashed with President would have been incredible if I

recording again and uh she tries to get out of the closet [noise]\n\nI just got researches lock them [noise]\nOh my God [noise]\nThe guy told me at first she thought like this isn't going to be that hard right after all she has the pad his wife I should call the front desk on skyscrapers and it was a problem\nThis wife I was like half of one bar and it kept just cutting out but I found the hotel number\nDiscourse is on the recording one to six six one nine six zero zero [noise] down there [noise]\n\nThank you for calling them I don't know how to how we can go to the\nPoint is you know

friend hey [noise] like eighth [noise]\nReservation\nI'm actually in room eleven thirty thanks can you hear me can you hear me [noise] [noise]\nAfter that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just like total silence nothing happens except every now and then turn just last to herself\n[noise]\nSeven one minute and\nForty seconds after the phone call then it's quiet there's no other sounds from forty four seconds and then in the recording you're here [laughter] [noise]\nNow and then she tries to door handles again thinking she told me later you know this can really be true I just can't there's got to be with us going to work\nOne wall because it has the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after car and locked up in she hears people she hears some German tourists walking towards her down the hall and fortunately she actually has the skills\nFor this very situation [noise]\nGermans come to the door of the room the whisper to each other for\nA little bit and then they do nothing [noise]\n[laughter]\nHer husband is I don't know ... he's also a singer and his phone was turned off she takes her mom there's nothing bad she found her mom and right then somebody taps on the door the hotel room and ... are you okay\nCan you come to the door the person asks [noise]\n\n[noise]\nCurrent news is really weird thing to say to somebody after getting less serious but you just

housekeeper set her free\nGod I was so happy to see her and she was how nice oh my gosh she was so nice\nI Know this is a weird question but like is it appropriate to tip in a situation like that [laughter]\nI don't know I didn't think of it than\nNot turned remember is she's just an opera singer right an opera is all about spectacle you know eighty people from the stage and horses and of vengeance and big grand feeling it was really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in space not much bigger than your body it isn't as simple as pot imaginable there's literally no movement in the spot if someone were to stage this as an opera\nHow would that go [laughter]\nUm it might be minimalist music actually are right\nLike just repeating theme over and over and over again\nWith me yelling help [noise]\nYou know people say those kinds of things in interviews and then I put the quote at the end of
