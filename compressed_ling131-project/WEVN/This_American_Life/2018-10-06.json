V. cute little ten Ninety One point nine an online at an H. P. R. dot org\n\nRemember in the news was boring and politics is boring that happen right\nWing of ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but may I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally divide the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years where\nRed America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions and to me this one feels the worst of all I think because the original hearing itself a doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours\nAnd then both witnesses were so\nEmotionally wrong that even watching it was emotional it was upsetting\nAnd then since at hearing we've had this week\nOf waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nAnd incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation in our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake\nCenter second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding\nOn a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nBut those people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable with all [noise] the b._b._c. Chicago it's this American Life America stay with us [laughter]\nBut [noise] judge [noise]\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over undecided than seem like it now and Kevin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week it was just like committed the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill issues with them in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how he made his choices\nThere's always the first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near and tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed his mind\n\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nInterested me up for an interview\nJust like these can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside is just like humming a little tune\nHe's just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was\nYou know\n[noise]\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination than English confronted by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake\nCrumbled Archie and I was one of the two women and that confrontation at her play good morning good morning when the elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAnd on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people loved his version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of\nThese last week has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him shake his head no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and when they do this morning that they have any sort of your mind\nAlso we talked about it was so stupid and there was a it was the thing\nIs just not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories of sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before fleeing I'd gotten an elevator and the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham before women jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out do you believe women Senator Flake\nNot easily to Portland we support what are you know one way and therefore when you think you can't replace what do you have to say something you can say the winning right now in the survivors clever Evan is er into this\nYeah are you going to do the right thing [noise] whatever happened to her and [noise]\nIt affects you and people like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of the ... making fun of themselves we talked about before like lots of men his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise]\n\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh not sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day think about it\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the\nThis is not a good process but it's always\nColleagues to recognize that area and we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt as certain to go out of this room today\nAnd uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here the night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing became back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a vote 'em and it's been it's just a head and debates staff\nDiscussions late last night too and it was that it was pretty raw you know [noise]\n[noise] Mm Mm Mm next morning of course like finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do in the end you've got to come back to\nThe presumption of innocence and\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV and to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that freaks yes\nHe chokes up reportedly said over and then we each make choices for our own region struggling sorry a\nLot of tears in the capital those two days the meeting begins the two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes a call he probably checks Twitter because he usually does but\nCouldn't stop the FBI report was a disgrace to basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI before do you feel\nBetter now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating\nYou but you're kind of back among among your people\nA joyous people that's what we're only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no aisle to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family\n[noise] [noise]\nChase is one of the producers of a program that turned out it is a recording that we found that Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years this him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today it's just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has that changed since he went through it\nWell I like my own uh [noise]\nUh you know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and they have to act in a political way\nThe frame or just knew that\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah\nIt has the obligation\nOr to recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence and integrity of our court\n\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament commitment\nOr the character and the learning\nI think the judge should be broadly read\nMy self was of fascinated with political theory you know if you if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about the [noise]\nSo so so so so that so that so the Senate ah\n[noise]\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people asked embed escape it cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court you know by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explained his job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us\nAnd um\nUh we begin with or group seniority for the most senior judge it to the\nAnd if the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved\nUm we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nLet's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just\nReverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you'll get\nAnd let's say it's five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up there\nThere there's there's a moment of all as\nWe realize one of us will have\nTo write an opinion\nThat commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nUh an opinion that explains\nIt teaches the principles of war the principles of the constitution that controls will result\nIn when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case we draw down on a\nCapital of trust we make a withdrawal on the trust in the public has in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish that trust\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nIn independence and fairness\nAnd quiet discussion\nAnd courtesy and scholarship [noise]\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\nOh okay well my story I don't know if this does anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to\nHear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raised his hand and said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nAnd or if they're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the briefs the second time\nOver the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera cases [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but it sounded\nKind of what intellectually pretentious thirty out here to some\nEastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because the attorney in the room raised his hand\nThe rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh yeah that either one sixth ... sixth back\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six fact [noise]\nThanks to form club and the Palm Beach is recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up a total and complete amateur has to decide the death sentence is only previous experience in these matters\nWatching law and order that's in a minute ...

today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them that whatever program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us in the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan gold's teen and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something they've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays the kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is a more serious one\nAnyway here's Johnny book staying\nIn two thousand and eight ... received a letter for jury duty\nYou know lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing oh no I Hope it don't get jury duty but I was more serious and interested in like the the process and you know I liked watching stuff like law and order and other things like that\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been known this trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nUm [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend\nNever expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness Shia driven me and if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing\nKnowing that there's that forgiveness of Trump's so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland and want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nOr he did begin to reply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and it just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like I really wrecked brings up\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was that the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened Glen and due to the cherry the parents of the victim came forward\nIt seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied to cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part we\nNot like Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds based on this testimony with only five days to spare\nPaul stories execution was postponed when you\nIt felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nWe're not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not drawing\n[noise]\nShame leads to inertia and it's even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain a nerd until it has acted upon by an external\nForce in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this was a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too\nForward I ask Marilyn as she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply she also\nForwards her original emailed to spin the once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son\nCartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail and the first place [laughter]\n... my job I mean I have\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get ... some\nSome of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meeting the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering her food that she can stop producing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea\nMaryland as a child and stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a jokester I'll make sure you have Maryland's out because she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kinda wanted everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up and go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our powders to cost about this and that was a very hard for me\nIt's like they wanted everything to be okay\nBut that's my chow\nAnd I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for and meant working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy\nOver Thirty years it became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nSo that's a hard thing\nMm Mm in [noise] um\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland red spends article she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay that's sitting at\nThe death penalty\nI had that I had literally died it didn't even register because I'm just like you\nKnow what just happened what have they done you know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read an okay what are they thinking what are they doing 'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he is\nAnd I want people to know you know everybody's ... they assumed that if you involved in a heinous crime that the two monster but he wasn't a monster\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] no okay so she is going to come up in Maryland and I had been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for us\nI think that probably than it's been so then as the ... and it's been a fan [laughter]\nI Hope I get that before we get to [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans spend this at the door [noise]\nAnd I then I'm Jonathan ... errands here now how do you\nSpend your ... okay\nI get a lot of trouble then lingers in the door the hotel room\nIt down or haven't seen it over there uh\nHe's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous so there were there with a lifetime Maryland in ... and been in the same room was ten years ago at the trial Maryland was seated behind the bar spent sat and the jury box\nBut today he sits down in the empty armchair beside or you can't quite bring himself a look at her as he tells Maryland what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lab\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] I read and re read it\nAnd I even began so her letters or never went anywhere I wouldn't want to say what did you say about that\nI don't want to write a letter that's trying to make me feel better you know what I mean from the moment the vote was cast I had regret I thought I'm doing the wrong thing\nAlthough it was great hearings are generally forgave him a couldn't forgive myself exactly and I can't even imagine how you most real", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life",
