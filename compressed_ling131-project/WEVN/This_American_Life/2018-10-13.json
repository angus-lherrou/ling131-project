Jackson Ninety nine point five there'll be eat the F cobra Ninety\nPoint three and W. E. B. Q. little ten Ninety One point nine and online at an H. P. R. dot org\nIt's school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it students face so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building\nAnd a week and a half before school started after a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district um rural Ohio the greatest record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team is a public watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations all over the school\nI saw the run a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the near safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're gonna play tape a decision to warn listeners they're allowed gunshots from blanks\nThat fire during these drills [noise] so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe\nYou have to put your finger on the sensor as of right and it gets tricky\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shoes [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade six twelve\nAnd he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria [noise]\nHe's got a gun he's rambling proof that he's holding a walkie talkie very focused very aware of the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and\nOne of these shootings and other to kill not enough of this way [noise]\nElementary awareness in elementary when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right\nSo the principles running down the hallway\nAnd he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically wonderful goes into lockdown\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one man\nHe's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they\nFind the shooter right there [noise]\nSo that's the goal the exercise they got there and they don't pretend to shoot him or anything they're just timing the response and it wasn't great\nThat wasn't attorney compared to the first oh it was it was on the doors [noise]\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option too though\nI I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time\nIn schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's ... guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one they came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own and\nAnd so I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me [noise]\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise] because if I miss [noise] there's a possibility of somebody else getting hurt [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that's who the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed but\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen [noise] did they not presently have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it looks a pass to dissipate the future\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThe b._b._c. Chicago it's this American Life America last stay with us\n...\n...\n... ... ... ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best way to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school\nThe teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhaul of the schools emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more for parents I mean they knew what to do\nEven sell even without fail\nPass okay I'm going to return to their families\nDo the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question one of our producers Robin semi and went to ... to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery period for every dish is what a code black is this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nBoy says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors the paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nAnd that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not losing are cool what she did\nWhat the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety second says kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in yes it was [laughter]\nYes it was a lab and\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise] I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n[laughter] [laughter]\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder she kind of Seventeen over twenty five\nStudents and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness apply a car that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet and it was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there was a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while in our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we've got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was open with the key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not sure\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] what they're told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below to his door\nAnd grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed 'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grade she survived Scott Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated waited\nA little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shooting for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in a rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook\nFor what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I Move us all to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best\nCheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too I'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAnd all I I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go ... shooter means I have to do that [noise]\nVersus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea that this is all you do [noise]\nThat you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nSupport for an HBO ... life's dream comes from you our listeners and from community minded fitting family dealerships serving keen ... and all of Chester county giving back to the community for over Thirty years ... dealerships dot com\nPulling in kids\nThe problem with that and unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now\nDoes she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school sweating hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nThat have been better off without it\n[noise] and the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nPeriod to traumatizing for kids\nWe don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all I Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about barricaded\nAnd I want to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because it's a thing to reckon with\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school shelves point about don't say codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I was a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\n... ... ... ... ...\nAfter a few minutes he's caught his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shootings to stop so you want to take action somehow you and then Chad's suddenly switches gears and starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nNoses before I was going on in this world [noise] taking drugs is ... because the strip or yours drug stores are still able to do and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun people leaving the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks\nAnd tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks I personally by however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several destination lawsuits when the Phillip says ran into him face to face and a gun control a bad he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nLoni got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stepped in broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous\nAfter the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved demanded was threatening him ended up in jail cell hoaxes or one of the things the Philips has formed parents about they tell families to brace themselves\n[noise] Mm [noise] Mm [noise] Mm [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course\nStarts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nFriends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's friend called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screaming just [noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting\nAnd I was like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trust\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was slowed it were so horrific and something I've never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nSandy Hook or twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yeah\nBecause they wish they had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt\nNervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's when I looked like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the ... there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from\nWell they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents a lot of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe to Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal my own brother should they should\nNo let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with this real you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away people who were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see\nAll that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida\nWho lost their son and the shooting in Parkland Hanukkah and that store at I met them at their house there is something was Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nMitt said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting ... phone calls\nAnd tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who match next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area they sat in a ballroom with other parents\nAnd waited every time the phone rang he jumped in his Nick calling from somebody else's phone um media was calling you do you have any comments can we help you find your son as just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car\nAnd then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from these rooms then their names were called out even walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like\n... we couldn't even find your son and you know and that whole thought that he was somewhere else and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was ... he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nOn August says this is just how her brain works she's an
