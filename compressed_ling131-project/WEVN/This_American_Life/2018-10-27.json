was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone\nAnd I was I guess ... maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to follow those because I think it works both ways I think that we still hope is that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded\nWell how was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it\n[laughter] it's only you knew you probably wouldn't make that I mean that people are complicated\nNow what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably thought what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo he sort of talk to us instead\nSo yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\n[noise] oh\n[noise]\nEvery time the subject of a hard time

for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it up and she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it\nInterfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but ah\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby

general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had to seem to us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the
