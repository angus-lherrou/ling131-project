minute I got engaged I became obsessed with the details of the wedding I thought it was an opportunity to show everybody who we were as a couple and not that we were just perfect for each other but we had perfect case to\nCite dived into research I was looking up at cakes and photo booth backdrops and wedding dresses I was basically the reason ... was invented and after all my deep dives that was ready to go I started the invitations I hand embroidered every one of my wedding invitation\nAnd I mailed them in on the left with vintage stamp size picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited [noise] so my dad got a salute to the military stamp then I had to ask our ... for a vintage WC Fields for a funny friend\nThat I may have Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but\nAfter those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache so I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my wedding bouquet like created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's wedding veil\nAnd he went along with all of this he actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the Knicks snatched vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little ... for the twelve cakes we're going to have\nIs twelve I'm a big believer in cake so\nThere were things he cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed didn't orchestrated it and send it off to the band and we got prepared for our big day it's going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but\nThat's what I wanted [laughter]\nWhich isn't my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years in the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring us the same good luck and we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and his sister's back yard so on April twenty fourth\nWe hung out let the twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made played bill I had done for the event\nNow and all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season\n[noise]\nI was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins into the shape of swans when the tornado siren went off\nAnd then came the rain and then hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the table over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud\nSix months of making them every night and they were destroyed no one saw any of it\nNow luckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that is lucky by the way up but\nWe had invited all of these circuits people but we had trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so up with the big top\nAnd we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in I'm ready to begin\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get into little cart I made so we just proceed without her [noise]\nUm [noise]\nI was looking forward to the song you know I hadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise] he's fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so um\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up\nAnd apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um\nSo throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies\nAmongst all of this\nThe worst part for me was that my dad decided not to come\nI didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there and I had to step father that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself but he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called him and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nI'm is only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding\nAnd that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter dance by myself so I I danced\nWith his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top [laughter] he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should've been and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen\nAll of our hamburger spiders just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the doubles\nFinally passed by and he missed our friends singing a song from ... to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\nAnd so\nAll it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle policemen and specialty cocktail I had made [laughter] which is just jak and coke but [noise]\nAnd the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day and they don't make the marriage either\nBecause I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that we shouldn't have gotten married\nThere's some things even take can't fix [noise] maybe\nIf I hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nEven though it began with the storm it didn't end with one\nWe were married increased corps\nWhich literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now\nWell it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nHe missed a part of my life\nAnd he also missed our friend I'm a meat\nLoaf cover artist called pot roast um\nIt was also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage well all of our friends danced in the pedals\nSo he missed a lot\nYou would think that with all this I Would sort of be sick of weddings I mean they're people who think they are a scam but I Love weddings\nI loved the details and stuff and I became a wedding planner [laughter]\nI've married about twenty five couples and they've been no tornado that any of them they've all been beautiful had perfectly detailed days\nI've added more and more pins probably about six thousand now all of these ideas going through my head\nIs if I ever get married

N. W. here's Tristan reef lived in Mexico\nIt's a bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner but if\nHe's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now have this\nJune I have a baby silence he turns around and I see that he is laughing at me this is the stupidest idea you've ever had\nNo I don't want to have a baby in his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while I'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption\nThey were ages five and seven and we were just trying to get that taste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nA this is in some kind of a feat of modern science uh I'm just transgender uh for me that means that I was born female uh I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person\nAnd I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um\nI could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy um which is what I did um [noise]\nI I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nUh and it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety\nUm navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am I'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah and I just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer\nI'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started\nTrying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started that thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel the peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nAh [noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right\nTime for me to get to be pregnant and so I refused I think the pregnancy test and then they have made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant and there was going to be a baby but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of the baby [noise]\nHayley in Riley been toddlers when they came to live with that so I didn't know what to do with a baby and then my body started to change really quickly I'm an all of those\nAh markers of femininity everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay and I think it's because really early on to my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be\nIn time and be born with a body that's more like ... or my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do or\nI could get excited about the things that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nAh and wait around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly um and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um\nAnd that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery says the media and I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and\nTrans people of color but for all of us there is also joy and love and and ... and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready [noise] um and we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant\nMan everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that\nUm CNN a Washington Post people magazine pregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there's a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trams um a lady once told me that she adopted her knees too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve while also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... and ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly Harry woman\nAnd that I was going to give birth to a monster\nAnd then one woman\nSent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby [noise]\nBecause that baby will be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you\nI was six months pregnant when I read that message now I have been trans for a long time Fifteen Years I'm actually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today [noise] um I think
