casino\nDesperately waiting for two lucky lady [noise] he told the story at a mosque nights called sentence and civility stories about currency\n\nTwo months ago I was in a casino in southern Washington state's feeling ill\nAre driven down from Seattle where I live now a friend of mine was was visiting Portland, Oregon and ah so I've driven down to to see him\nUm [noise] but I also brought along ten thousand dollars in cash with me because you never know and I started this because you know on the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was at a casino\nAnd uh casinos are a little bit sad\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd I was also concerned about my own\nGambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a a legitimate um\nMathematically valid method for winning at the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse and so I Am sitting at this table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me has dealt a hand he gets a twenty as his hand a but it's not an ordinary twenty it's made up of to queens apart screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe\nUm everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to count cards for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of\nFriends and mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in and when a and take the money out of the casino which you take in cash you take it\nA new stuff it into your pockets you stuff it into money belts you put it into your breast pocket of your shirt or a jacket and you walk out with it and you feel\nPhysically enhanced with that happens\nAnd in fact in the turn of a single card on one\nHand had gone within crying distance\nOf this fifty thousand dollar not I was trying to recover\nEventually\nSomewhat but grudgingly\nThey paid the Kashmir\nI took away I took every hundred dollar bills that they had\nIn the casinos and small place I also took every fifty dollar bill [noise]\nAnd a lot of the twenties [noise]\nAnd I took this water and just stuffed it down my pants that I was physically ... expanded\nIn this weird ... way sort of like in the old days but I turned around and I wasn't in Las Vegas I was in this ... this small place where there were twenty five or thirty people all staring at me customers or the casino\nPeople who work there weren't going around and everybody there and knew exactly\nWhat I had just won and they'd see me at the cashier they knew I was getting paid in cash and so I moved briskly for the exit [noise]\nAnd ah briskly across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a series of strategic you turn to ensure I wasn't being followed and then got on the interstate five north towards Seattle through the woods in the dark of night it was five PM but at the Pacific northwest\nSo [noise] uh [noise] and I felt expanded in this way as I said but also I felt this team linguistics of\nParanoia verging on terror and I kept looking back in the rearview mirror examining\nThe headlines in the distance trying to into it if any of the cars back to their look menacing and I kept asking myself again and again is everything going to be All right\nThank you [noise]\nJosh ... until ...\nRockets and fairly dark memoir I think life at the professional card counting blackjack player Catherine Burns the mosques artistic director sat down to talk to Josh about its history with them off here's Katharine remembering the first time she heard him tell a story and a party\nWas totally silent but everybody turn to you holding their attention telling this

twenty five and then blasted the bless your heart you did agree to do that and get it and were brilliant\nWell I think part of part of the whatever\nMight happen with with card counting story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them are I think struck with the possibility that they just can't decide if the person is in fact\nA lunatic who thinks that he goes around winning uh casinos and has paranoid delusions of being chased by casino personnel or or in fact it deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you so you had been telling stories like\nDinner parties for years and years clearly but what was it like the first time you actually stepped on stage with the purpose of telling a story to a crowd the stranger as\nIt was harrowing it's like a different body to experience you're there and the spotlight is on you you're not really aware of your limbs or the rest of your your body in the normal way that you would be\nWhen Josh Axelrod was on a new play left at casinos he was appearing on them off stage and goodness huge name Lee Aaron Blair\nOr did it a under a pseudonym\nI'm In part because mine name at that time still had some value\nTo sort of value of a cart counters real name tends to deteriorate overtime as 'cause you just become increasingly aware of it um but also because it's long been obvious to me the card counter reviewed legally changes his name should change it to\nThree or more first name's presents a piece of ID to a person that just you know he can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personalities with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas from all over the country there are often confused I'm so that you can create from one legal name multiple aliases based on a genuine id [noise]\nTo hear the rest of this interview and proponents material related to

lines\n[noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man that I thought war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few\nThousand dollars I went to Bosnia during the civil war is are you able to try to learn to be a war reporter and war with all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body there wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people die and wars of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl who's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken\nBy surprise military forces\nA and\nThey took her up to a field above a talent goes to a record and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat and what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summer it was hot\nThe only way you could tell she was a girl\nWay you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\n\nI remember the first time I got ready to die\nPrepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines that it was\nA goat getting pretty bad out there and I tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really weren't good for much and then there's another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was ... and I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt at all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this\nBut I could see the little black hole that the bullet comes out of\nYou know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grabbed the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes well all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was it turned eighty inside those holes and there are so small\nThe thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more worse I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze\nIn combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day was really quiet hot day nothing was\nGoing on I was leaning against them sandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about bullets that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at because the sound the bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle\nAnd then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the bullet\nThe bullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt what's the angles deviation at five hundred meters\nThat gives you two inches to the right now what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it\nUm and then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nWere coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking in and everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags and our gear was right\nSupport for an HP our

documentary about this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we were going to spend as much\nOf the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rich in eastern Afghanistan\nSo we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip so I had to go home to kind of ... So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American positions got overrun they dragged off a wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight they got him back but it was bad out there way worse than anyone back home really knew you know\nAnd in the middle of all that Tim broke his leg\nHe's a ten thousand feet up in the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medic examines his foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get hammered here's two Advil\nAnd Tim new Jim knew that if you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out\nThere and he did it I don't know how but he did it he got down on that mountain\n\nSo we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst is in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd if the the film did really well\nAnd started it started with the scene\nUm that was very\nTook me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came um scene where I'm riding in a Humvee 'cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg I riding in a Humvee and all of a sudden everything goes orange and black and the Humvee got blown up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Keene", "day": "27"}
