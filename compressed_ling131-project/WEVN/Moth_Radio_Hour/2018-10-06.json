radio hour I'm Jennifer\nToday we're going to hear some stories that have it on something noted\nMillions of each ... each day most are in consequential but sometimes our eyes grow wide and we'd be early on on a detail that changes everything that's what happened to our first story teller our our Thomas when he pulled focus on a small sign in a library\nOriginally told this story for us to his hometown of Baltimore math here he is alive at the [noise]\nThe first time I went viral was in two thousand and two um do you know what that means going viral stepping wherever we passed through on the same name or the same article ah we're all talking to each other on the Internet at the same time\nAnd that happened to me in two thousand and two now two thousand two as you remember what the wild west days of the Internet or there was no Twitter there was no YouTube very few people were on\nFacebook so it was really really hard to go viral back then uh and I say that so you'll be impressed [noise]\nStudent at the University of Maryland and um it was really hard time in my life I was sad all the time uh and I was tired all the time and I didn't really make any friends on campus I just went to class and I didn't join in the activity but just\nOccasionally were right movie reviews for the college newspaper and I did that mostly because I really like free things um\nThey go home and I was a direct my parents' basement and for work I worked at the local the Baltimore Sun the local paper um in their subscription complaints department I'm\nAnd so we would call me if they didn't get their paper delivered in the morning and sometimes he would call me if they had a complaint about a an editorial I couldn't really do much about that and sometimes people just call me because they were lonely um and so I Would go in and five and talk on the phone until noon and then I Would go to campus\nUm and then I Would go back home and that with my life\nSo I went viral in February um I was in the campus bookstore one afternoon I'm In February courses black history month\nAnd so they had a display up for black history month that said from bondage to book\nAnd it had a

Jennifer Hicks in\nOur next story is by a special ed teacher\nWe first met any can destroy slim health not far from her home\nHere than he live at the [noise]\n\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought in Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of guy negative connotation and I had to suppress\nCuriosity asking all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants\nYou're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nKeep your head down\nLearn English\nGo to school get good grades go to college\nMary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them\nBecause I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which is bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me my mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops\nAnd uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America\nAnd so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents\nAnd if the U.S versus China and I asked my dad who every rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought\nAsk that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause the rockets right\nBut I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was excited to watch a PBS documentary\nAbout the economy I'm married\nPeople that I've seen three people who ever looked at like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd moon line a cartoon character [noise]\nSo I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes\nWhich talks about people marching and protesting people who look like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identities their life they were marching for this\nMan named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers crisis in Detroit where Japanese companies were booming\nAnd people thought the Japanese were stealing their jobs\nThey fought\nThe guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest once his funeral and said the next week\nThe two guys who killed ... never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Filipino people\nAre now saying if this could happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together\nSo my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and\nShe points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nThat your family what\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related ... like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin have I ever met him\nNo I haven't met them because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two but I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nThat she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions\nHow could I ask about a murder man and our family\nI had nothing to stay at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking of articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother little each in ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nAt her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers of boyfriends and she wants\nNice\nAt some moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because the woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself\nTo find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example and my family of someone who spoke up\nTo be a ... again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out\nWho will each in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where Vincent Chin lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit\nMy friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery ... grave we she drives us and we find ... name on a tombstone lowly chains name on the tombstone ... husband's name on a tombstone\nThey're no longer goals\nThere right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why does means so much to me I go\nThe next states in my relatives house we're eating swelled dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see pictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd so I asked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's line my grandmother had a brother and nine sisters\nThe second sister on this list is slowly chiton so now I Know lowly chin is my grandmother's sister lowly chin is my mother's first aunts and Vincent Chin is my mother first cousin so I asked my eighth grade ... who\nWhat happens to lowly after Vincent Chin died\n\nWell when Vince inside lowly was all alone in Detroit\nOrg [noise] everyone out there listening with a story starting to
