P. R. dot org\n\nOh [noise]\n[noise] right [noise]\nBreak that that they have pretty good I Love listening to this is a\nFrom one World Trade center in\nManhattan this is the New Yorker radio our coal production of WNYC Studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick if you watch the video of two protesters with Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women had been treated for so long\nThe way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter\nIf you look at the way flake changed his position afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subject of Rebecca Traister his new book good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe book and binds a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement\nTraister is written for New York magazine el the New York times in the Washington Post and her last book was called all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation\nRebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh both testified about her sexual assault allegations\nRebecca there's no way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the\nSenate Judiciary committee has done its questioning ... there was a very specific story being told by professor Ford as well as as as we near us and others in a very particular ... what did the specifics telling me the specifics of\nTheir stories yeah well we are getting a very full and detailed view\nOf cultures around wealth white fundamentally\nPatriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite\nUm friday\nHard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free um social circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on paths toward immense power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young and irresponsible I was young and responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about this sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement\nIt's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful it's sort of it\nOh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good mad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf but more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world\nIn this country how it was built and who would still excludes in systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger the ploy men to anger historically toward toward good [noise] um [noise] what's that you often [noise]\nUm it was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um they'll take some doing oh God yes [noise]\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been blink or by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class\nUm that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast\nWith a bunch of women and one of them had said about the white young white men who was like the classic Bernie supporter like\nShe had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her\nWhere the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leave him be it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women do not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be Phyllis Schlafly you're right I understand and have sympathy\nWith that like just let 'em run right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys would that going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also think about white women\nAnd what impulses and messages are at work on white women\nAnd um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of whiteness in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so clouded [noise]\nAnd it was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year assist twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like I not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professionally professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dry is I'm I'm so mad and he was like\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is anger\nAnd as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what but suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplar of constructive anger in the book historically\nA black woman I'm Shirley Chisholm Florence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great hats or Rosa Parks and ... and ... and of course the the mother of Emmett Till\nThat's not by any coincidence that's not how the smart by accident\nNo not at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice in for him to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean a poly Murray who somebody I write about in this book\nPolly Maria was credited by both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately wind up\nI'm protecting and are trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader um\nAnd Florence Kennedy I haven't heard the name Florence Kennedy in years I mean she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem or little even if she ... she and she and Gloria Steinem we're speaking partners caught on the road again right to tell us a little bit about foreign ... so Florence\nKennedy was a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous\nFor her time but I think she would be outrageous now highly shot in her demeanor and her willingness to\nBe vocally pro family unapologetically enjoy fully pissed off about everything she was pissed off [laughter] and there was a lot of it she was mad about racism she was mad about sexism and she wasn't going to play nice at all\nThat's Joan Baez singing at the march on Washington in Nineteen sixty three [noise]\nNext week on the New Yorker radio hour we'll look back at her part in one of the most tumultuous decades in our history [noise]\nYou know I think as I get older sometimes I Do or something to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know what\nI'm In that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah another way\nI'll talk with buys about protest songs then and now I Know the next week on the New York review our\nAnother way\n\nYou're listening to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick today is part two of our story the long distance con\nAll right I hear your here that they are here the problem\n[noise] always from a an order for us to go forward now\nThere is a simulated charred\nSeventy thousand dollars\nWe're listening here to a phone call a ... by many Terry Robinson in two thousand and not with his business partner\nNow\nI worked ... seventies house you're going to raise their own they named er about just for a minute there's no way I can do to them and I don't say that I just listen for a minute\nRobinson's partner was in West Virginia man living in manila named Jim Stuckey and some of the things stuck he's telling Robinson are kind of extraordinary\nWhat what this means that we can get the money is that we've been talking about taking out of it [noise] [noise]\nOne million dollars All right now that is not that great advantage the great advantage to somewhere in the city of [noise]\nI'm twenty to twenty five trillion dollar counting the value gold um diamond on all these other [noise] if you can find even through your friends or something like that you\nHeard him right he said it's really stuck he said he was involved in a project to get us bonds currency and gold bullion out in the Philippines\nWhere the treasures were said to be in secret locations guarded by poor tribal people now if you're thinking how can I get in on this I should tell you that the story\nIs very much like a number of scams based in the Philippines including some investigated by the U.S Secret Service and stuck himself wants to fraud at a bank in Maryland Robinson recorded his calls ... suggesting that\nHe might have been suspicious and yet for over a decade up to the time of his death he sent Stuckey hundreds of thousands of dollars his kids lost their inheritance and his wife lost the house\nCity you know you cannot send that man any more money you're enabling him and um after he died I found out he sent him another for it\nJerry Robinson daughter Maggie was left with the tapes\nOn the phone calls and she began trying to understand how her father who's\nBeen so conscious so successful in business had fallen for which seems\nLike an obvious scam\nLearning and I'm Renee large sum

contributor an author the book\nThe confidence game I mean the number one don't go comical was sort of Jim sticky were con artist he could be quite dangerous\nAnd don't underestimate old men they are people who've been con artist or entire life and if you think they have end of life regrets think again I mean I don't think Jim is going to assault but someone else\nAnd not only that she was afraid that Maggie might get conned herself and\nHe's going to talk to you and he's going to seem nice and you're going to say oh like you know maybe he's not such a bad guy\nOnce that happens and the breach could in the distance between the two of you that's the moment that objectivity stops that's why it's always very easy to tell when other people have been caught but the people in the ... and we judge
