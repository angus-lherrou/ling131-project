R. dot org\n[noise] someone in Manhattan or certainly covert action in the New Yorker WNYC studio ...\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages\nOn Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help her and has been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all\nLogan lamb is a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy\nI enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time and August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election you started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems which ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election stuck in a salt dot edu\nOr Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website and generally that turns up reports or public presentations\nAnd this this particular searched didn't\nTurn that up instead I found a very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a voter named in some sort of a dent in fire next to their name and I immediately thought while that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor password to be used on election day\nThere were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like the sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of it lamb also found a security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of\nTheir Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also gyms databases and the gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members on from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked ... in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think is at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here\nIn franchise voters an attacker could of compromise the Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise] this is right\nAround the same time the the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect us from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched then more information\nStarted to trickle out [noise] the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to elections servers in a number of states including\nGeorgia [noise] look we have no idea of the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that\nForeign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open [noise]\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts citizen green hall is policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia are computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot\nAnd then there's also other machines which count paper about those are all the computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location\nWhether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet it has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop our regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should laugh\nFrom that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep bunks that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modem to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\nWe spent a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies\nBut there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia\nThat purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections or whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\n\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls or they they endured county they use electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you are at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nFor the electronic pull books was a vendor named the our system now the our systems had been\nTargeted by a Russian intelligence spear phishing attack\nAnd um the state board of elections did their own investigation or as did the county to county report has been made public it wasn't very in depth that didn't consider a cyber attack 'em and concluded that it was a poll worker or malfunctions\nIs going to miss the sun [laughter] [noise]\nI'm miss the animals and I miss you ever want another well\nAnother well\nI Need to know the play is will there peas and he knows where\n\nThis one ... um ...\n\nSinging all this ... um ... the when it's been kissing me so long\n[noise] another word\nAnother well\nAnother well\n\n\nThat's the beauty of beauty isn't it you do you ever say we're texting with a known about the songs that they do how much do tease out what the song is about\nOh I didn't I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change you know\nBut you you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter] sixties and in many moments in between ... and just how does this seem\nSimilar a different [noise] um it's just I couldn't have dreamed this up all the stuff I've been through and all the countries no dictatorships and the you know I'm\nIn through all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil and it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you release me thinking how am I going to conduct my life\nIt's you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay the lying no problem no perjury yeah not a problem um ... that that is a new normal\nAnd how does it change the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as yeah proceed through the day well I think\nMean I've heard other people say this to IT law oftentimes hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety anxious about the state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my\nDenial that's great advice yeah and um don't expect much I mean keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary you forget which one it was because this\nThis scene appears in so many documentaries of using the march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you\nVisualize in your mind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen was a half million people or whatever it was\nDo you think about these moments in your past and you know I think\nAs I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it\nUm in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some times a year in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea\nI think festival a political moment\nYeah I'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like aunt you know they're just gobs of people\nAnd so I had a hint then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever and in yours and mine yeah\n... you know this next song that you're going to do I\nWent to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these these ... relatives with people who lost people in the church there in this in the slaughter\nAnd it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama a win too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of\nA president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that not only is the crowd with him in the field they feel like allies\nBut he's able to sing the song and begin the song that lift people up as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yeah how do you remember that that terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the song\n[noise] well covering this song it was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future that song just dropped out of the sky shouldn't by the way most offered I did not know and most people didn't know and\nI Need to tune that didn't get to architect I mean if I was quicker and tune you can only be knocking that guitar and you're killing on knocking ear hearing it loudly\nAnd just go ahead yeah okay Mm\nMm\nMm Mm\nMm Mm Mm Mm\nYoung men came to our house and they didn't know when you're on him he was not friends he was not keen but they all ...\nAnd they let him Maine\nForeign our the strangers to me that he sat with them many C.\nBut then a young man to God and killed nine people ... yeah\n[noise] Mm Mm Mm Mm\nIn Charleston in the month of June Mm mourners gathered in\nThe president came to speak some ...\nAnd the cameras roll and the nation and ...\nNo one could say what must be in for all the living and so on that\nDay and then that play\nPresident's ...\nCheese that President sang\nMany thing\nMm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nWe argue would lay the blame on one man hanging around nation shame some sickness but the minute or so\nAnd how we might be made whoa\nNo one could say what must see for all the living and so on that\nDay and he's the president sang\nAmazing grace in my president\nA man thing right\n...\nWell yeah the last line is my president do switch is this just switch yeah for that President and vice president he says is the only president you felt of this and that way but\nUm yeah and I had to decide whether it's going to use that are not cause though we wrote it um my president I thought ... [laughter]\nAnd then all of them they have to lie cheat and steal do all that stuff [noise]\nUm but yeah it'd be the state's money was smart he was carrying in spite of whatever the war for you know and there were some Afghanistan you know I'm border crossings [noise]\n\nHe also called a friend in London so he could record an audio diary of its day ah which could then be posted on his website and it's updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHe was in current and the good looking\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine [noise]\nMost of my friends friends they are wild and Wales so that someone in the special forces was very very glamorous\nI'm actually I could ...\nI think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nHe had recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a we're opposites uh she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world than Antarctica\nYet for all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nHe really was a tree romantic he loved parent Trey\nHe loved ah he\nHe did tapestry\nHe's ditched the most wonderful\nTastes legit skating across the snow\nHe loves the history of all these old explorers and\nHe glamorize satellites that his head and\nSaid that there was no\n\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways a was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self\nHe set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nAnd forth\n\nAnd so I made a decision that always astonished to Henry worse Lee\nHe decided to turn to\nThe vet really\nAnd his other ... most famous expedition that Shackleton had wanted to walk\nPrice to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica his ship or the difference that frozen in the eyes and Shackleton found him in all his men more room on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was he was able to guide all the men in his immediate party and get them back all home alive\nI Know that they have a very for the last three or four\nYears I was very interested in the grocery store and there was a raise and kind of expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition which very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer and the model that he lived by was a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had warning bells when he came back from a trip to says ... just stuff Dr ... spent ten and was incredibly excited because he had managed to sleep beside Shackleton grave\nIt wasn't until when he was about forte that he does it really took about ... photo and Shackleton footsteps\nSo by the time that Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children backs and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say suddenly wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole or you know his kids were a little bit will dirt\nBut a joy and it was very supportive\nOf us well huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams and most of the time\nMy rich still excused from fulfilling you're an individual dreams\nBecause you've failed you have to get permission from the other person and I felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that had a lot of fun and he went in the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town really\nSo for his third trip he wanted to walk across Antarctica to fulfill the goal that as heroes shocked and was not able to achieve but he wanted to do it alone\n[noise] excess by this\nTime of settled on the trail or not I am\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up with the early in the morning hike up his lead that usually took about an hour as harness we'll be connected to the sweat and he would begin to haul the Donald Michael meal\nFluffy and skiing for Ninety minutes taking a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories in a day\nOr every crazy food fish shuttle statesmanship small chips like X Y story\nHe would do this particularly in a task and challenge day after day there was something almost primal about a\nCold warriors\nHis singular purpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was the ultimately accomplished his goal\n... ... ... miles today [noise]\nAnd some say\nThe nine ... one of the longer 'cause I just I have a ... a good thing for anyone gunpoint\nCurrent you know ... ... but it's only you know from all this is all I can do the engine of the day\nHe would track for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape is covered with a sheet of ice it's possible for losses\nFor actually dropping off his ability to just ... it was a very tough day many polls is leading skew\nSix seven PM ... during the run\nUp and we'll set of much again was twelve festival nine\nEnough [noise]\nTo to him I don't know it\nWhile he was at that on a satellite fan [noise]\nHave signed it much harder than other expeditions and at least if you're with other people you can take time to be at the front\nWhereas if you're the lead scare\nPrint size miles [noise]\nHeath timed it could take my God\n\nHe felt the constant strain of making his mileage so that he could reach the end point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season and talked to cope with the temperature drops even further it can reach a minus a hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nEven Eli a shuts down then and at that point that would be no exit\nPolls show off of them\nWill go on those so I'm not being except for the oil which says to them although one of the goals recognized as a joke\nOn getting your feet all day but it was the guy but will it says July ... years old\nI listen to his ... every day and they were pretty good they were ... bait but uh I was\nJust very concerned that was a hundred miles on his and he was ... he was fifty five when he says instead of [noise]\nShe could hear him growing more tired [noise]\nBut you wonder what she should do [noise]\nHe worried constantly constantly that he was staying\nTonight I was in a terrible position as to what to say\nHenry ... dog just less ... you know it's going to make and [noise] you cannot make the end or say you did die [noise] to re difficult one [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "New Yorker Radio Hour", "city": "Keene", "day": "14"}
