Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and yell from Austin is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance go rogue\nWere on a leafy suburb and straight their colonial houses which are made of brac inside and was final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five and she works in marketing\nUh have you heard about running for office Danielle ... around you do okay\nWell I actually live right on Devon drives and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on a Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within five fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground\nMy neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fear is Danielle with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impacts heavier fears about an impact your life um [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in ... county in Pennsylvania and it was a snow cone pipeline that was only a week old and so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my babies like burning in her bed [noise] and um [noise] I call them and I said John we have to move like you have to move we can't [noise] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there are only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect the dots between what's going on politically nationally\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nJust an example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it ...\nCan affect anyone anyone let's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to\nMe I just saw something\nLike\nMaybe I thought it would run for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just a lack of humanity from are the people who represent us\n[noise] it's\nIt's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nDaniels opponent and district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reach representative Corbin for an interview and she spent the following statement I have a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she lifted her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\n[noise] ... but here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking is made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state\nIn America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including to know go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline safety or top priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design on pipeline to follow the safest wrong with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP as a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline move natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nWe were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop with a hundred miles west of action in the small town of blows or fail\nAt blooms gun shop we not Ralph and Doris blue their shop is a small building in a modified garage on their property or shot guns are mixed up with things stun guns in the interests and its infested was clicking\nFor thirty five years and make a joke you like it is going to do is going to get any better role to me the pipeline\nWent right through their property and they say it had killed their hay and ruined their drinking water\nWe are new order have noted drinking water to drink 'cause we would rather nurturing June of two thousand and Seventeen ... so what do we go back then the word ...\nHi [noise]\nHello how are you [laughter]\nAnd he didn't look unlike under ... and I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion in the play where he
