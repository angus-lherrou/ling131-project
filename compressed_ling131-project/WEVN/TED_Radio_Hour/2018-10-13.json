from NPR I'm Guy Raj I Want to start the at the beginning of your career in the Nineteen eighties you I guess you you started out as a as a public defender right\nI did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating from law school and what was what was the idea behind it you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise]\nThat's right and I like lots of people had no idea what was going on now criminal legal system in my third year in law school [noise] um I joined the criminal defense clinic and why you and step into Manhattan criminal court\nAnd never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg [noise]\nWhat I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes for justice [noise] um and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime how policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts\nIs deeply deeply defined by class in by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities [noise] here's more from Robin Steinberg [noise] on the stage Mm\nRate um nonsense so fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America I'm is addicted to imprison us from slavery is a massive ... it always has been we all know the shocking numbers the United states and crush rates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night in America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of anything\nThese mothers and fathers and sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only\nThey cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that\nIs calm down\nHow much does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount um in their own discretion\nI have seen it as low as a hundred dollars for the people that we represent and the clients that we see bell is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nSupport for an HP are comes from you are sustaining numbers and from Dana Farber Cancer Institute bringing Dana Farber expertise closer to you Dana Farber dot org slash locations

and for animal rights lawyer Stephen was that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven was on to the [noise]\nWhat have you look at the pencil [noise] it's a thing it's a legal thing\nIn certain books you might have heard the cars you own they're all legal thing the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things now\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see\nHis mouth and he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes\nThey're legal things [noise]\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times uh thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nAnd the person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way I mean like\nYou mean like ... men\nOr actually Freeman or persons but slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be the person\nThe ... does not have legal rights and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons like it is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and thing are both terms of art and and\nThat's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last\nFew years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights\nEven why these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals a that's a cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer\nAnd by Nineteen eighty five I realize that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal per se is\nNow at that time there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person that are legal rights for a non human animal I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially ... change the designation of nonhuman animal some illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my ... and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nAnd that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal movement is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa she survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and after he got\nThere James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because of an Eighteen century slave\nOne of the major responsibility Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight and enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London\nSigned him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets\nWill now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law written hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset and he had this corpus it's meant to protect\nAny of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume without deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he issued the writ of habeas corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain the ship\nThere were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trends substantiate ... and the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers of course a non human version of James hammers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find to James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the non human animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds\nAnd hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed a hundred and sixty pages of half a day to day and we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge to allow an autonomous being to being sleeved is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this\nSupport for an HP ours led stream comes from you our

from NPR I'm Guy Raz and on the show today ideas about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nOnce you've sent out ten thousand lettuce to random sexual the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then for\nThose who were still interested in that you do a second random selection as I was interested in making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the countries and making sure you had\nGender balanced you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me was already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better from my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it that already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes John out of some people\nI'm not tonight I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams the settlers and it's just I just got by Douglas Adams saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people to all three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years of that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to instigate a one day like the chamber in one solution\nChamber once with fishing buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a path to old is the idea [noise]\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these in out parliament's tried to say to your friends I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nJudging what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate his recycling box the surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these mountain examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically if it is something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nWe have our strategy a and that is yet to to\nMore often which seems to be happening now after the average citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to\nA sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime that being for example a U.S state legislature with the second buddies flick the bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a hugely ill battle is to try to convince\nPeople and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes yeah it ... it I'm not I think it will be easy to political changes ... seats are especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to own a unified on to try something new I seek help system's broke two and a known to see a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs

you want to do\nI did study law because of a kind of\nDreamy idea about what the law is this is ... Mario he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosopher ... who has this book between facts and norms and he says\nDemocracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat do we are one another where we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives and I I Love this idea of law as the kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between facts and norms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge get oftentimes people who need those rules the most have never even heard of them and um\nThe systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken or both\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law to the people here the ... on the head stage [noise]\nI Want to tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none to\nRelease from a community of hurts people\nIncluded out on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from when he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they list\nThen Twenty years later the same company to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nIndia is got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company has violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears really says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nRobbie has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\nHe said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing on the Saturday used the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gate to that factory with a bucket of petrol in his head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it\nRight now in Sierra Leone in Cambodia in Ethiopia farmers are being cajoled into putting their film", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Keene", "day": "13"}
