was on oppression Olympics I Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and you saw it live young the so called so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like\nKind of uncomfortable right because you you were talking about how you shake like ... and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire you know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially I\nDo naturally because men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was doing New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny ... way people are able to move on with me\n[noise] yeah because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because\nI mean disability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time\nI think what they're not used to sing as someone with a disability who's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\n\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in\nCan't my father's ... what you can do it yet you can get [noise]\nIf my three older sisters warm up and I was mopping if my three older sisters went to public school my parents went to the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother's slipper [noise]\nMy father taught me and I walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he uses he would dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me [laughter] [laughter] my inner river was very strong and\n[noise]\nBy that first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been punched one too many times [noise]\nSo when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk at five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was\nTo be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning\nRealize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an author and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm his daring [laughter]\nYou know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or their challenges their humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven\nIn New York City my friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media\nAnd we always made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just wanted to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalking about guys are talking about several probably talked about you know I don't like\nBut I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life\nDo battle because having grown up with you know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle East I'm really worried\nAbout where we are right now in this country and when I did that Ted Talk I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really thought it was the disability that was gonna be the thing that I was championing know\nAdditional menu cocktail and beer selections one forty eight north main street

the show tapes\nPainfully funny ideas about humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life\nSo we're just hearing from comedian again first thought\nMedian traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up a conversation about Islamophobia which at times required little patient [laughter]\nYeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nThat trip took was the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming and not too long after it came up something happened back in New York a place where again usually felt welcomed than accepted\nAnd no I hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly designed I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use a better font but\nDecided why not macho own poster campaign right that's a nice things about Muslims so myself comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign we raised money work for over five months that proved to an end to\nWe're supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to ban the poster citing political content was not a couple of those posters here is one of the Muslim\nMuslims [noise] let's see what the truth about Muslims are great for the recipe\nFor us are considered political by the NCAA or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political but it is it it's about justice so we\nHave to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters campaign abiding bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise] so basically what I have a couple of dark comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one\n[noise]\nA very weird feeling I was like as a blonde girls\nWork is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that I continue telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nOccasional danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapon [noise]\n\nShe took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was\nSuccessful yeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called me about religion we're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all the New Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prices like an outdated calendar salivating already and rules are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that were totally

said\nLord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nDo we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stuff done them so why would we hold Islam to separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God not a whole lot of difference between the\nThree of them goes [noise] it's incredible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing was performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nGet one person to laugh and a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people chuckling and does chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shifting perception\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these chuckle

Missouri [noise]\nIs that we as physicians [noise] she's ... she's receivers though [noise]\nThree hours of it was marketed as [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is what Kevin does for a living but being funny\nIs also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation\nOr a shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young\nPerson when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be the invitation into ideas thoughts and stories that\nMight otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for cabin humor was a way to deal with depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nI was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nRadically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuated in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nAnd you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark helpless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly been a long way I didn't want people to see that and I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight or you know
