I think that's that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise] we have long lists\nOf gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscle\nSupport for

team electricians and plumbers learn more at revision energy dot com slash careers\nResilient a painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere is a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific\nGenetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a fun you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity we might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits do inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against this thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes UCR five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wanders\nSweeping given that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years\nNow we're talking about the technology that will not only affect that individual but that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so\nThat's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it ... embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles\nGene variants associated with higher a Jew or being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise]

com\n\nHot today show we're asking a very important question which is who are we\nOkay by the way do you have the answer do you know who we are\nUh I Know who I Am [laughter] ...\nA year I have a a a an area where we are\nThis is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\nSo yeah what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equip us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just sad and to understand what accounts for the differences between us\nWe kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with this [laughter] okay I'll do my best [noise]\nOkay just to get us started human beings\nHave debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand and two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from the historian was they are taking you got that man has no instinct and the anthropologist fast we want to do\nThe human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from Hochul a scientist Stephen J gold\nWithout ... why should have been such an appealing notion\nWell there are number political reasons why people are found congenial foremost is that if we're blank slate and by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero but if something is written on the slate and some people could have more of an others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political sphere of human nature is that\nIf we were blank slate we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instincts and perhaps some of them can damage to selfishness prejudice and violence\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to ... human mind here's a blank slate and some of them just come from common sense as many people have\nTold me over the
