nobody's going to say hey what are you doing that's my bell pepper no of course I don't know that note\nBut the really interesting thing is that it's it it helps throw back some attitudes about

from NPR I'm Guy rise and to on the show ideas about food a connection to it and its power to change so much\nAbout the way we live I just bought a bottle of water and I'm the label it said\nGluten free interesting well and it is [laughter] versus food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and\nMarketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process and the government through direct and indirect\nThe growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late nineteenth early twentieth century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest their second biggest producer tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now I Know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then the corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many ... corn products as could be crammed into it\nHome cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups because all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine\nA piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice for dessert\nStore bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here\nSo I can say this now this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad by the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food\nWe knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state\nThat the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home at the same time masses if women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men\nTo share the burden so now you got here pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got here fend for yourself lights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and ... like what you were saying earlier ally that has to do with with the fact that I think we should food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs in and this could go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want to mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I met and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is off\nNot everything so I mean you are an omnivore you need everything but you you were a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you are a food to eat like I think of Mark Bittman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I Do this book called the ... going before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan untold dinnertime and do whatever but you know I think\nThat the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know a a head of broccoli doesn't need a label because matter broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can\nAs you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients implants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for every one that's the hard part but by improving our own\nAnd that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food\nEat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less\nAnd save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at Ted dot com [noise] um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I tell you the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago it was a pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nRight I don't care about the great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta why the hell you can get sweet potato pasta which is which shouldn't have come from a housing bust has been a Julia ...\nOkay so am I getting that saying that that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but they had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate Seventy four percent whacked Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert Lustig is a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know pa know tuition digital them or are that's even he has some famous now\nPuree or evaporated ... yeah my favorite because cages so

foods\nThe sense that ah most of what you're tasting the fruit to the floor or let me see the Hubble the to the smoky are actually being dictated by nostrils Rob raised in his wonderful job of ... and\nThe information I get from my nose and makes me believe as if it's coming from I ... this is Charles Spence across middle research the tree that oaks but university what is the cross motor research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... having the psychology department where we look at how the senses interact\nAnd yes our mouth and nose interact when we eat the mouse and our ears\nWeeding experiments where we're feeding people up potato chips and each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound they could sometimes making their own crunching ...\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas to crunch the freshness or these other groups that\nCharles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might ... a a white wine ... with an odorless tasteless food dye\nAddict and appropriate you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think because of red wine all the ... the tobacco and the dark chocolates and the state and fruits and so on even though they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles Spence on the stage\nOr here this morning to tell you about the perfect meal rural convinced we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavor was narrowed them as of the wind in the glass\nBut if I look at what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we even drink out of the question is how to study of how to measure is I'm a tendency among the scientists that been your guest strong it's it's just that people like your eye a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink and see which parts of the brain lights up this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nIs one problem here which is in fact some of the matter is that one of these brain scan is lying on your back where they had climbed stale with Cuban your marriage\nThat periodically ... sin or something drink you call it can be full of your head all kind of a jolt and that will spoil that the brain scan alignment but it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI'm actually a different for each and every one of us make something very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nUm I have no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting with that part and I say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with doesn't resonate and then you can never quite capture when you get back home is that as your moods you pretty relaxed your holiday less stressed with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like and how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing read one that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions which I'm from the province all rosy paradox that used to describe a northern Europeans um but to kill the guy for that holiday\nI'm not saying who some well or on the side of the sea sipping not Rosie wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not tasteless like the best glass of wine you've ever had so great that you want to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show good taste you happen and you bring it back and then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah\nI can say well how is it something about when the bottles when they're playing with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not about a tool and we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments and certain state of mind\nOn all mental state and the environment both together kind of impact what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile anyway some\nMyths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise] and put some of that plugs into what we think about food [noise]\nIn fact just Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convince some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor and has been in these methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood to taste good isn't a bad mood I never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll bring everything else that's our the Siegel the smell of the salt in the uh the walls of the song on our backs all of that is play against the experience\nAnd pop shops are capturing that insights in addition to\nThat any of that too much to install restaurant in in Switzerland when he got his tuition star restaurant\nA white table cloths\nThere's no ... on the table was no glasses and I play like nothing was a plastic car people wait say what he told me seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can say well we'll tables the full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up seriously that plastic how\nI Wonder if they get up there for the little one euro tower and it makes it moving sounded and sort of some of those types of it that would be laughing and then even guaranteed within a minute you have the whole restaurant full of moving car was laughing Dina's and that\nIs the moment when it first comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even the taste of a two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\nWow so it's like from from a neurological perspective [noise]\nDo we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[laughter] uh no so we don't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all kind of classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste\nI work with a young chef coaches if you have here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending our question has several weeks have to be living his restaurant I'd say what'd you remember yeah they said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that construction something\nThey don't have the experience that I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talk to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color re school days just the sourcing the preparation but nothing else but\nHe says their case or I'm near restaurants um do you serve the food remarried plastic cutlery known as a silver and where's your restaurant exactly oh it's in a country manor house looking at nature so the the St Louis things in the one hand but clearly\nYou can never sort of ... food just by itself it's always serve on something in a certain environment those kinda\nFactors are always that they cannot people always say certainly the I think\nThe younger chefs who are now putting upstart Hitler and Venus\nWho who I really think for the first time in history saying we don't need to just about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were sitting [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book is called the perfect meal you\nCan see his entire talk at Ted that NPR got Oregon\nSo let's get just a little bit more creative about what's on our plate because that's what ... does okay my name is Marshall bicker and you are in a while getting in getting whereas like an Indian\n... it's very difficult for you to front and yes I can do that you were out in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week my cell and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner",
