P. R. [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when\nThe bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms\nSo you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross and I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because\nPart of a of the scene part of a point of the movie\nIs that you know women can do gross that comedy just as men can\nAnd it really wasn't the point of it okay\nNone of none of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film kind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this\nGrossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny because it did feel like\nFor lack of a better way to terminate ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause it's weird things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like oh my gosh look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it\nSupport for an

of electricians and plumbers learn more at revision energy dot com slash careers\nAnd there's a question do women want to establish their quality by doing gross out scenes because your mind is really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended\nIt was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character\nMhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that we can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fall and said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that is a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[laughter] insulting to do that [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter] but\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the ... the other ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car did you say that\nThat's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do have to say All right you know to know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no what he what he said to me was he called me on what language Catherine language I mean how can a relay what these do not balls to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager ... next door some\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul Bank commercial that's what you look like you're a big commercial couple none of this talk if productive I Would like to read and my legs and kick you end up with my phone\nJust really scaring me this is what happens when you corner you corner me I won't you throw you out to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it and it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I got it all out on on screen but\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that and the person was sitting with was to sit for watching you say it he said all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel like\nTo say every anything that came up to the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything so um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory how'd you improv insults before yes I've had a\n... inch and only have played a lot of kind of very\nAssertive um characters that you know I think in the heat or especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just it you literally say anything just to kind of ... ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her\nIn her own authority so it was a big part of that character and you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um there is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder you're sure you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nAnd I guess as Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that traps on Netflix Wednesday\nI'm

I. E. A.\nDot or this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there\nWhich is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\n... when you went into a regular comedy clubs something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like do your\nJob off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] like it just every time or something in that vein\nAnd especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes [noise]\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling\nIs you have to really shut them down like truly shutter now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it [noise] so in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to end\nThis I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise] so I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands for women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do votes and then talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she is a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's\nThe first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there to somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened as Washington Times oh my God so I Know there's the light oh ... ever\nPresent uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light man I Would have flash it at like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know the stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner\nOr manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah and the feeling other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they left he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up 'cause I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he is really encouraging me and then I [noise]\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure\nThat you can act and material that means something to you that you ...\nBecause yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read your kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like\nCar all [laughter] I said I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like\nWhy doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this 'cause I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily\nEnded because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful for you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more\nEmpowered in Hollywood now [noise]\nEvery little\nIn ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys\nThere has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields\nWhich is what I think is so important for me to its its branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and I think the more we we linked up and and realize their strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars in the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review and new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nNovember six is fast approaching and candidates are crossing the state speaking with voters I like his message or like his back\nWhat about just turned Eighteen and may so important starting after the familiar with all the candidates are more than four\nHowever you make sure you're following the news you need to make an informed decision and then we stay tuned to NPR for all our election coverage", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "22"}
