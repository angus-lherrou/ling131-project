I have to um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your parents I actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre\nJob um I Love Dennis O'Hare who played Dr ...\nAnd uh he it's a weird job because there is a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about the fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the Catherine ... character is a writer and she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies and her age and cause her\nAnd said have you seen the cover and Catherine hunts has no no no and so she runs to her email to open the ...\nLooks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Kevin has a feminist and the character and and in the novel a undercover there's a woman in this like white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards a who's played by ... I should mention that as they're attacking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre so solar trade\nCollege is sending its ideology is alive and I didn't have a career and then hand out she said and then the bills for our eyes and I guess\nYou can't play second or if I'm going to some for our ambivalent about having it is\nDon't know you're not because you realize that the voters leaving the dog but\nBefore you kept changing the deadline is remember\nOh yeah oh we'll start as soon as I finish the play\nRight after I get the story published\nKnowing awful\nOh I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation\nA lot of women has been a hit forty one\nI just don't think it's Gloria Steinem falls that we can't get pregnant [noise]\nI guess it is mine too busy

like\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose okay\nSo that was Catherine ... and ... and a scene from my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYou mean blaming myself yeah when you like the body and Catherine mind and get her ... in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some\nNotion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she's really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your ah to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nLike the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a\nLot of women when you're trying\nTo reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a\nMom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambling he was really like a character\nSo you made three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so he'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise]\nI'm In part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type 'em right and there isn't a strange men\nNeed between you between the character and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one and wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has made you so focused\nYou know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean it's [noise] I must be I mean it's hard\nTo know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother we live with our father than we live with their mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we\nDid a lot [laughter] what what is your Mother's Day arrangements um when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad um\n... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me\nUm had been a living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at heart\nI was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Mary in high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to move with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents and we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we were so happy my brother was\nYou know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and [noise] um\n... you know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\n... well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in um um and then when we lived with my mother she would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and\nThere was never food and the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and ... ...\nYeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off mastiff so was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah [noise]\nYeah it was just a book Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting a ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI'd just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at this you're pulling the ...\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from revision energy a local employee owned company helping thousands of granite staters go solar\nRevision energy is currently growing their team of electricians and plumbers learn more at revision energy dot com slash careers\nIt opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday\nShe also co wrote the film adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters after a break Marine Corps again will review the new memoir heartland\nAbout growing up just below the poverty line in a family that had been family farmers in rural Kansas I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nIt's fresh air on an HP aren't coming up at ten o'clock it as it happens from the CBC\nYou can give on line Valerie was saying um most of the standards do that in H.

Austin's he's a staff writer for the New Yorker his story ghost in the machine about Martin Zucker burg and Facebook appears in a recent issue of the magazine they recently took down um posts from Alex Jones of infowars you want to tell us that tell us about\nYeah this was a a really an important case study in how Facebook's going to deal with it the most complicated problem in some sense which is content what are you simply do with the fact that people are posting a billion items of content to Facebook every day that's the actual number and [noise]\nWhat they've tried to do is to say okay we're we're going to punish hate speech we're going to prevent hate speech from being on here um but for things that are less than hate speech if it's just misinformation or things that appear to be wrong by accent well then we're not going to ban that person from Facebook we're going to try to use other tools we may\nMake their posts less visible we might share them was ... but the case of infowars which as we all know is a a conspiracy website led by Alex Jones and [noise]\nFor years it has promoted in particular the fall so it it's a false conspiracy theory that that the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school was a stage it was a hoax and it was designed to try to advance in the anti gun agenda that's the theory and\nFor years people have complained to Facebook about it they said this really has risen to the level of harassment of the parents who are or who are the whose children were killed at Sandy Hook and\nIn ... this summer people started to criticize the company more publicly and said look you you need to remove infowars this is no longer a normal content they disqualified themselves from being a part of civil discourse here bye\nBye bye directing all of this harassment at the parents of ... and then there was the parents of one of the children at Sandy Hook wrote an open letter quite candid and very tough I I directed it marks out could work and said\nThat they've been driven into hiding because of their as they put it in ... battle with Facebook to try to get this kind of\nMaterial taken down so that they don't have to deal with trolls and people who are discovering their address and then and then threatening them online and finally I'm this summer apple took down infowars as\nA podcast and then very soon thereafter\nAnd I talk to them or talk about it I said why did you wait this\nWhy did you wait so long why did you wait so long to take down this thing that people had so clearly complained about and he said well which we don't want to punish people who are just wrong we don't want to ban them from Facebook what we're trying to do is figure out how to shape this thing\nAnd he acknowledged in effect that because apple had moved on this that he said you know at that point we realized we had to make a decision we had to get we had to get rid of this and and so we did it\nBut from my perspective what was interesting about this was that this is the very beginning of an issue for face but this is not the end I mean this is\nJust the front edge of an unbelievably complex problem which is what are the bounds of of free speech what do we actually want to be able to have\nAnd what do we consider to be out of bounds what is in effect shouting fire in a crowded theater and what is legitimate provocative unsavory speech and and these are some of the hardest problems that we face and they're now in the hands of let's face it there in the hands of the engineers the people who created this incredibly powerful a application\nYou know there's lots of First Amendment law that says the government can't distinguish types of speech and Burr headed um is it clear that a private company like Facebook can when it's this\nThey well they actually Facebook as a private company can do whatever it wants on speech if if they decided tomorrow that you couldn't talk about golden retrievers on Facebook they could put that ruined place and I think for some reason that\nWe find ourselves really torn you even if you're not a fan of info wars and God Knows I'm not it has to make a person on easy to know that there is now a company which is capable of deciding not only what kind of information it's going to suppress but also which kind of information it's going to promote\nAnd on any given day there are people who are going to be offended by those choices um but the tools by which Facebook has held accountable or not the tools that we use in politics it's not like you vote the bums out it's not like people are appointed to Facebook's board as if they were Supreme Court justices this is a case in which a private company\nIs making profound choices about the contours and the boundaries of political expression and we don't have obvious tools with which to regulate them\nYou know when you look at the arc of the story I mean this company founded by mark ... has this astonishing growth has deeply committed to growth and in doing so [noise]\nYou know compromises privacy and and ends up you know sharing data it shouldn't about its users and gets into some trouble and a question arises about whether the company has the ability um has the capacity for self reflection whether it can take\nYou know adverse information and reexamine its assumptions and practices and in many respects this really comes down to ... ... what did you find about that [noise]\nFound that he is insulated too I think an unhealthy degree from this kind of criticism and\nIf he was sitting with me right now I Would say this directly the reality is he built the company in his own image she's\nHad the luxury of sculpting an organization too is like I mean quite literally the the blue color that Facebook has as its signature blue is chosen because he is red green colorblind and he prefers to look at the color blue we can see a very distinctly so in every way both physical and spiritual this company\nReflects his sensibilities but in order to be able to continue to grow and evolve and respond to the problems that it encountered\nHe needs people sitting in the room with him who will tell him mark I think you're not seeing this the right way you're not seeing this clearly you're wrong and I was struck that in our interviews I got the sense from him that he knows that on some level he's tried over the years to make these [noise]\nAs as the bubble uh he's got five people who report directly to him and they are all people who he has an effect chosen a and installed in those positions and there's very few there are very few people at Facebook who are willing to stick their neck out and say I fundamentally disagree we need to do things differently", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)",
