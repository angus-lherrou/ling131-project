A. dot org I\nThink that part of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition [noise] so\nUm you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there is a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now I guess you know\nIn the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable and their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I\nDidn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a really good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something that is an ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways one it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people nuts part in the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that a question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra\nQuestion ...\nYou read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness what do you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that\nGirls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time uh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the ...\nActually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out well you know the thing\nAbout yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the\nResponsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person and having the full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little ... okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance it may\nRecently you know guys try to come up and downs of you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I didn't want his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked was that the first time that happened here\nThat was definitely a first for me\nI mean I ... yeah I I didn't\nThink that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him and Mary and\nI'm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so I think that's a great
