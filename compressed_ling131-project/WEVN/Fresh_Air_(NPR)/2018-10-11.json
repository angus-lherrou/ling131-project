congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering if like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think I'd be the same sort of initial ah you know it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the ... the incredible books movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar the medic terrain at least two or ...\nWe used full scale replicas of these capsules there were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were exactly the same our production designer an eighth and crowded an incredible job sort of rebuilding these things and we'd we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth\nQuite violently if we needed them to ah and we would set those up against a giant Eli D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe meats sort of a rocking back and forth me sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh disorientation and just physical jostling um all of this\nIn the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and ... you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up in question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting ... from we we had to take\nA we had to take a moment no it got us actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you a rest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space\nIn juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks are little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is this is a piece by piece a hand built\nMachine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the man on the flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and still you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't that's I guess they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release urology um didn't get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and uh was sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nGearing Heinz who plays ... in the movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find on line and and the wording as is worth\nUh I I actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a a line in the in the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intent to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know or at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nI guess just ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and licked Schwartz will review a new set of young minds

Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon or things what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah so it's it's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup\nAnd what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of a genre that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect and Neal Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah man is incredibly like Flora and piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your way to the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nRomney version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a ... mentioned in Japan since book\nThat Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that ah that Neal and some of the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they play the abuse from divorced shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune or something that was actually a Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play this track that really no one listening no much control certainly known in the

directed by ... who also directed la la la land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash\n[noise] um and I think I found remarkable was that you were working\nOn ... land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really be done shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and uh so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life it was sort of you know just\nA a you know\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and ah by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and ah we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you had to deal with like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nRhetoric as in real sad and then miniatures it it's it's\nYou know a lot of land with a complex film but that's like the choreography in the camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nI mean I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history a and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right or the knowing that at the end of the\nWere ah going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they want to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work\nThat much harder to you know really get it right and

penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me you know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people all the way you\nA grass on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were\nThinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nThink that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national\nSo um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now I guess you know\nIn the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I\nDidn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a really good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why were you\nResistance to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sexes something ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question um they really have to be an extra question ...\nYou read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness one you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that\nGirls don't always saying no\nThey certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time uh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the\nResponsibility on her and it makes you like really awkward\nOne person and having the full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little dorky okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance at night\nRecently you know guys tried to come up and dance with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I didn't want his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked was that the first time that happened here\nThat was definitely the first time in fact it up for it to me I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him and Mary and\nI'm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so I think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who\nTruly a you know are in night clubs or at dance parties a lot understand like this is my buddy I own at people have to ask permission to touch it\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa ... is author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus we'll talk

justifying\nOn this kind of way that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of the students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up you know these kids that I interviewed in college just graduating now\nYou know Brittany spears was just like they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion and that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with\nSo they don't
