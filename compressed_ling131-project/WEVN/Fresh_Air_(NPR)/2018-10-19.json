art of the deal his TV show The Apprentice and his successful presidential campaign were based on his image as a brilliant dealmaker and self made billionaire but recent New York times reporting reveals a different narrative\nIt's based on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my guess or outright fraud\nSuzanne ... and David Barstow or two of the reporters at the New York times who wrote a long investigative article about the many tax maneuvers Fred Trump devised to pass his vast fortune onto his children\nDoes and crack writes about the intersection of politics money and government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes in\nResponse to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nBut neither the president nor his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSo then crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here give us a sense of French from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak\nFor Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York's the strategy was the guy who build and sold his first home before he reach the age of twenty\nBy the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of homes your mother told me he was in his mid forties she was really the biggest\nDevelopers are treated in the country and what these specialized him was building middle class housing whose homes were she built in his apartment buildings which rebuild and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're coming is no frills\nHomes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford hum of building in Brooklyn and queens and his uh and so you had an enormous skill building will cross housing and she also specialized and\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties and especially with the return of the jeers from World war two\nInto ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that he's sold certainly you know to make himself a celebrity and to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily to win win the presidency\nAnd so this story really die sex that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts hum and based on the actual documents an entirely new financial narrative of the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans he got from his father and tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engagements aspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\nIt's fresh air on an age PR support for an H.

Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans now one million I'm In today's dollars quits two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw but I think it's important also is the head in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise] um we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to do for Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increased\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to raise\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he use the money for many of his ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history\nIn Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going was father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nIt also see that when his cell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them there's\nSpooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this was a time\nAnd the you know the ... kind of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nInfrared Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money is three and a half million dollars worth of it was\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see and Donald Trump at this period\nHas a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and you will and it was caught a soldier the will just take him to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk and Fred Trump\nImmediately says no he freaks out and he\nMakes a call to his daughter\nWho is a federal judge in a lawyer and a new caught us all within months has dropped to that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\nSo what you're saying I think is that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this\nIs an attempt to bring his um to Jane\nComplete control over his state and potentially to use the umpire for Trump\nDoggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Susan ... after a break we'll talk about another scheme used to transfer of wealth from Fred Trump's real estate empire to his

Barstow who along with ... published a long investigative article this month about ... schemes to avoid paying taxes on transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... di Donna Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still\nOwn at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision [noise]\nThe interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were\nFred Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped\nThat after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why he sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meetings after Trump die they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check and then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds so that the the uh buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death out there including all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to their children\nThey included both buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York development ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about died as we learned through the the the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down and Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the I. R. S.\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they've placed on buildings made the trumps pay\nA few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a recession and can extract\nA few million dollars that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nMost families who you know wealthy families who are the most expensive legal and accounting hoping who engage in these very sophisticated\nManeuvers to avoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more\nAt the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in the state tax returns\n[noise] um since then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabric\nWhen public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David [noise] or another comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually costs it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken\nOf twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice in the song money money money money that happened in two thousand and four I'm right is the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there\nThat the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried shrimp belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making\nAbilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nIn that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked and I think that we've\n... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken that I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were\nAnd how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents hop I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents with the Trump family themselves um but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it allowed because you know [laughter]\nUh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] and ... but we uh yeah it was uh just\nI'm with a yeah it's pretty messy\nWas a little ... and it'll cost her father too I Would imagine [laughter] but other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise]\nUm actually if people knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell thank you for your reporting and thank you for telling us about it says and Craig David Barstow thank you so much [noise] You're welcome thank you thank you Suzanne ... and David Barstow our reporters for the New York times article reported with rest Buettner about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "19"}
