Dave Davies spoke to them about their new book like war the weaponization of social media\nWell pi Wu singer and Emerson broken welcome to fresh air you know we we all know that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in this book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming a military offensive this was the German invasion of France whatever\nSo you have this new technology but a conducted everything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population was wireless communications and\nRadio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes or the rise of not seeing them go bulls a said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also Hodge strategic tactical military impact\nOr when the Germans invades France and invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work\nIt not only allows them to connect all there are military units in a new manner allow him to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population\nAnd its broader contagion of fear\nAnd it's one of these things that the contemporaries described as this this strange defeat um they couldn't express what happened until they figured out really radio was what caused it all costs the world to change\nWell the other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right\nThat's right and it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs in a credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nNumbers

speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America in a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about ... ...\nWas called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were hip to the importance of this what do they do\nSo it was actually a the twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign\nThe\nCampaign in twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Hamas militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would put out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered then all of us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the ... of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line but it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a how they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader\nUh organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world can participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cause and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist and an online army and get new what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in\nTaylor Swift army of swift these\nYou can list in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same but the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one poll from the world at at crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research and this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou report rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion to drive it through your own ends\nThe same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson breaking authors of the new book like war the weaponization of

was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us ... W singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute\nHeld opinions do you have any sense of [noise] I mean they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the comment on hearing in many ways that felt like a war going back and forth and uh it was in a certain way\nYou had both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd source hunt using images\nFrom Washington National baseball games to try and figure out\nWho sat next to Kavanaugh to a unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket debt then you've got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona as in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative be buried underneath this you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself for at least the online place that we go to a stylish and learn about history we ... so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine Russian actors go under what competing very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook that was sexual term\nAnd during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on ... uh do you make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again\nBecause both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nLarger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some way surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas a light customer service um the company see this also is a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same a chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies in turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have this science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so so these neural networks ... could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of NO NAME somebody Joe Biden offering some you know profane of committed something\nTo get real world examples of this there have already been\nCreations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together where for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like which oh by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that to meld together to allow you to in essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in this space it's\nGoing to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's gonna be monetize for for profit and it's also going to be weaponized\nEmerson broken ...

reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut and space\nI Love the film but I was wondering if like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think I'd be the same sort of initial ah you know it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making her or kind of had to my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the ... the incredible books the movie is based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar the medic terrain at least two\nWe used a full scale replicas of these capsules there were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were exactly the same or production designer an eighth and crowded an incredible job sort of rebuilding these things and we'd we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth\nQuite violently if we needed them to ah and we would set those up against a giant Eli D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nUCD earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be revealed is shaking will be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it\nLooks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh disorientation and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and ... you know ah [laughter] oh we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up Horton question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to\nSay and I was getting ... from ...\nNo he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of it himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine but\nI think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em\nAnd you think of space as being very quiet but I guess at times like this is not quiet at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and said can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space and film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of beam me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you'd actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the man on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't ask don't guess they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release urology um didn't get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and uh was sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nGearing Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\n... actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the\nWillingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech and says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what they intend to that speech was but yet also at the same time it's incredible\nSupport for any ... live stream comes from you our listeners and from Congress regional

first human to walk on the ...\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that [noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah so it's it's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup\nAnd what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect inhale Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your point of the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know ruin or might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange and I asked somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that ah that Neal and some of the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece from about divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a than Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and I'm In college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who is a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play this track that really no one\nListening no Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nIt's an interesting which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by ... who also directed la la land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash\n[noise] um and I think than remarkable was that you were working\nOn a land before first man but a lot of land with a turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men uh and uh so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life it was sort of you know just\nA a you know\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and ah by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you to most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like\nSound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like replicating real sad and then miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know a lot of land was a complex film but that's like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the the the responsibility the weight of history a and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with those\nAre all through the making of it and and helping us get it right or but knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were are going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they were gonna see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just a kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to just go that that much further work\nThat much harder to you know really get it right and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nThey mentioned that thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on ... congratulations\nAnd thank you so nice to be back thanks for having me gave me\nAnd win an Oscar for
