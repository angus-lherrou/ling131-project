Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace\nAnd you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWe mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time well yeah that's\nTrue and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it it's a very it's an issue very much of the moment interestingly because I've got a con around the block\nSee anything he was on like fluid in his ... yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's ah describes him as inter\nAnd [laughter] that's the kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and but I've had gay friends with gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of flu but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you get used to it you saw what you wanted to see you know and I I think Louis kind of open to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then well that's right they did\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from coastal main botanical gardens in booth they main

tickets at Maine gardens dot org\nStarting about Lou being cheap introducing a guy who wants to spend money we were living in these all of these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took lose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said what would his father ever given money she said of course he would have given their money you know if it's anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and you know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that\nHe couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not ... so he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes extending have trans grass have is that [laughter] I'm not totally\nThey don't have any I always see would say because you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to buy time in making money and if they were already ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship it was a you know along with\nA you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl but ah yeah but in real life you you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol\nLike Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of yeah to kind of expand his his his his reach 'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for lead\nIt's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... a a Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know and says like we should have a bad you know rock and roll is getting to be a thing and so they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know on you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for handy\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Morsi has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio decided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking so they got Nico\nModel an actress and soon to be finger too young to be their lead singer you lose not crazy about that but I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with the heat limited Nico was participation as much as he could\nYou know um she only saying you know a few songs or the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got kicked out of the band as well after having an affair with her\nWell that's very true [laughter] that way every bill part of those times um\nAnd that was a year so that was one of the issues with Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time where I was in the newspapers all the time they're not\nYou know not art critics reading about it and although that too but it's just like ah this crazy guy you know he thinks they're Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspapers or whatever he did got attention and ah you know Lou took advantage of that\nBut that also hurt the velvet underground in a\nYou know rock and roll certainly back that was pretty Ernest thing and the I ... seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a bat and you know for for people who haven't heard them yet you know and hurt our amazing mirror so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know that needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way of the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nI

Curtis is written a new book about Lou Reed at a new biography called Lou Reed life [noise]\nLiberate second solo album after the velvet underground broke up a transformer was produced by David Bowie and you know always of course famous for all of his you know ... and for his sexual fluidity what impact did working with David Bowie have on lead in terms of\nHis self image and his persona\nWell you know Lou how complicated feelings about that um\nYou know at the time it was a big opportunity I mean David Bowie was kind of the you know the coming thing\nAnd uh you know bully you [laughter] you know as with flu like there was a very conventional aspect of the way I mean much as he was a boundary breaker he always you know kind of respected his older you know and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list\nAnd so he you know ... offered to produce transformer and restored\nYou know lose standing after the velvet underground and created a solo career for him and gave him his only hit 'em they'll walk on the wall side was on that record\nLou of course once you got the hit that he desperately wanted you know kind of came to resented and you know thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it he really needed it and he really wanted it and I'm ... and ... guitar player ... who co produced that album with a with with David\nUh they created that song and also you know ... other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are that are on that record and uh you know made it such a you know such a significant album for Lou\n... walk on the ... from that album and\nUm this was his only real like radio hit and it was a big hand I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about [noise]\n\nCalling from Miami ... hitchhiked to way across the U.S the\nClubs ... rounds on the way to shave their legs and then he was uh she she says the the\nSick along in the wild things are said hey honey ... ah [noise]\n\nCandy came from now on the island\nActually read walk on the wild sign his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie\nI'm so that so that was actually a head friendly but it's got from your book like he was attacked he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and\nHe sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you don't look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band had have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more than that yeah yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits you know you got a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nOr you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I'd lie in the highest but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a harsh and depressing record 'em [noise]\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed his daddy you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career it was just an hour of just [noise]\nBack you know it was again a gesture that woods unsinkable before Lou did it and I'm\nJust I like I never wanted he wanted to have is music reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance exactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so I'm ... and his album St hassle you you say that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a which is documented quite movingly or in the song street hospital apart call slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview on you know at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially you know saying like Rachel Neal stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of I'm Rachel wanted to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was um [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean a got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there would be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um [noise] bitterness\nBut uh\nBut still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different accept at St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called\nJust so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing [noise] um so ... there's the middle part [laughter] a a street hassle trying to say anything about this that's part\nYeah I'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry a as an thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they dragged him out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nI'm Lou turns that male character into a female character and then you know describes the guy who is the host of the party 'em urging a his guests to get this girl's body out of his apartment\n[noise]\nYou don't live that way and then and it really was nice talking and I really wish that we tend to speak\nWould you know get the heads are trying to ... percent deeply so how was your old guys and [noise]\nAnd it's not like we did there was this one to do and that was made you know I Would have been a nurse [noise]\nWoman's noon or anything that is a universe choosing ages\nThe way that is really some team in ... when\nWould you be moved around the girl\nIs to reduce the worse it since I don't have to choose a get out and I knew the Xena when cheating is mind your brain only being just ran the darkness gene by mornings you know the hit and run [noise]",
