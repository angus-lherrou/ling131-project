I was carrying in and the kids\n... can\nBe a guilt trip right now I'm just saying you hold on myself\nI Know they wanted you to be there that's all [noise]\nI'm Sorry that um [noise]\nI see so\nPlease skin and money where does this and this guy got through this is kind of we're halfway right now I got five day soon get us look like it's working out and do it just looks like it's working out what the therapy how you can come home you know that when they get work please Mick [noise]\nI can do some research do some research she got it okay to me that\nYou think that you have this under control\nAnd I ... you are\nI think she said why do things for me any difference alright I'm attract craziness and you're just embarrassed because I was like you know I don't think this amazing thing that you're special ... or something and you don't like who I Am now who are you near me here and this is why I Am\nToday we'll hear parts of Terry's interviews with the chefs first her conversation with David and Nick chef recorded in two thousand date she started with the question for David\nCan you talk a little bit about how he stands personality changed when he was using their\nPiggy became unrecognizable or he went from being\nYou know just one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew and he became\nThis coast a sort of coming in and out of the house I mean physically he changed you know he lost\nHis skin and bonds and he was jittery and and then his behavior changed I mean he went from being as I said this sort of a charming lovely kind open gentle person was he became belligerent and angry and depressed and argumentative and he did things that were just inconceivable\nYou look toward a higher power to give these strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how ... year you were are still are an an atheist and raised in it without religion um did in the eye\nTo eye to felt guilty when you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for\nThat too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was an ethnic would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know\nNick didn't agree for a long time which is ... ... but he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lot of time trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself and the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are\nJust fundamentally you know don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nReally important to that we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get healthy again sober and to stop using the first thing that Nick told me about when he arrived at this last program which he sat with a um\nCounselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you mean about the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic\nAnd the guy said well wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that rehab was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know ... ... ... you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think the I mean you know that's what he says that but those three months were essential\nTo do that program not ... not rely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and that was a part of it but um\nThere was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and it's where every experience some of the traumas that experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed that mean for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to let myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all and that I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't\nHave anything to do with a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody mhm that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power [noise]\nI I learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is um it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to Al Anon meetings I was told by someone before this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is a way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to\nPray I'm going to do what they told me about all of a sudden they were part moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through ... what does it mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way be that way just to stay sane and to stay focused on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um what part of what saved you from your math addiction was a degree in self knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think one thing we have in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with a diagnosis\nYes I mean that's the you know it's a ... I think it's like very very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's you know it's so subtle I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily\nYou know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's awesome absolutely\nA Nick tells a story in his book but to me is so profound and its\nShe came to see us I'm Karen like my wife and Jasper and daisy or we were in this we haven't seen that for a long time and and care and said you know let's let's go next to join us we were going on a family vacation and it came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what we've been going on and it was sort of the apologize to them in a way that's I think it was just so meaningful to them into caring and to me and we had a really good time and then he describes the day before he was leaving she got\nJust really annoyed by asking you talked about you know he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I believing oh I'm at is what's going on here I'm studying my I don't really want to leave part of me wants to stay here\nAnd be a child or going to be you know with my family and\nSo I'm sort of ... ... and then all of a sudden he said he felt he said that I felt I feel better now and then he went back in the rest of the trip was was great and we had a really nice less day but then he said what just happened he says another time in my life that moment\nWould have just been the beginning of a descent and it would have been the kind of dissent but rather ended up and they're going out to have a drink or to get some pot and then\nIt's a mess and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together well\nListen congratulations to both of you on on on the books in on the sobriety neck and you know that you could have good luck with some you know with continuing unity and everything I I you know I Wish you wish you well thank you both so much\nThank you Terry thanks Terry\n... about his struggled with addiction is titled tweak growing up on methamphetamines David\nChefs memoir about his son's addiction is called beautiful boy which is also the name of the new movie starring Steve ... based on both their memoirs Germany spoke with him in two thousand date\nDavid Sheff returned to fresh air five years later to talk about what he'd learned about the science of addiction and recovery will hear that interview after a short break\nAnd movie critic Justin ... will review the new Melissa McCarthy film can you ever forgive me [noise]\nWhen the babies that this is fresh air [noise]\n\n... our family foundation support WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere [noise]\nCapital one what's in your wallet\nCapital one in a [noise]\nAnd from logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaborative meeting platform was over Eighteen\nMillion monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more it go to meeting dot com\nThis is an HP are it's nine thirty and good evening [noise]\nDedicated listener Joanne harden Frank has included an HP our inner ... may not be the biggest trials but I Want to be able to pay back what I feel for\nWill be able to enjoy [noise] leaving I guess to an each PR as an inspired way to support an organization enriched your life and that of others in your community to learn more about including an HP are in your state plans to an H.

think that every situation is different and in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but\nIf I was there again I Would have gone to get him and brought him home\nAnd [noise] done everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to because he could have gone out and scored an overdose in God\nIf I got him home at least they would have been off the streets and I may have been able to get him back and treatment and I would have done

can it's not easy in some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks\nBut um I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other wave but\nWhatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes Nick would just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he ... he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you a treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it um but as things went forward I mean the last time that ... you know he's been sober for a long time it was after ... can I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic\nI opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of vodka then I took one I thought to myself\nJust one which is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week\nSo he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the handled and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day to me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments\nSupport

much progress one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so so when they got in that play on that day I saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so ah\nIt shows that it's possible if people think the treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit about twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a ... step program you probably gone to you know a twelve step program for parents Ellen on yeah yeah\nAnd then you visited them just as research for the book to you see is she you know positives and negatives with the top step program\nToo I think most people know what the positive uh parts are but what are some of the problems you have to stop\nThe twelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but\nNot most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embraced the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative\nBut I did go to Alan on meetings and what I found there was something different that helped me you know when it became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I I was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people told me over and over\nAnd over again go to Ellen on new things got Al Anon meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and thing I'm not going into one of those rooms where people are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt\nYou know these are my people they\nKnow what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me also going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to\nBe my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together I walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as when I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretty tense and those rooms there was this open this it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the days\nWhen it comes on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK let's see if it's not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as person that just gives all update on his life is that's not prying too much\nIt's not I mean there is really you know I think he's gray market I said he's he's an unbelievable person I'm a ... and so I'm I'm I'm prejudiced but he he looks Jordan\nHelps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you know the kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gotten into recovery is really healthy he exercises every day he got married to this woman that we adore you know they were best friends when they were sixth and seventh grade\nHis writing like mad he just out of the novel or accepted\nSo you know we're just so lucky whereas if we're lucky I'm I mean all these other things are are great but the main thing is that he's alive there were so many times when I didn't think he was going to make it\nGave a check thank you so much for talking with us and I'm pleased to my best regards to your son that I spoke with him once [laughter] on the show and I'm I'm so glad he's um he's doing well thank you thank you very much I'm Sorry thank you so much", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city":
