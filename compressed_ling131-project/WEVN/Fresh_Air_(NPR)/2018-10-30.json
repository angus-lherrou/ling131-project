Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how Bowers views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement pose is\nMy guest ... is a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred\nAnd focus is on the story of Derek Black\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties in a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning\nHe likes that slow welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book Garrett black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father done black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he\nDid not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that\nBut do you find Don black story relevant\nTo the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and Don work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist\nSlogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word sort of statement of purpose that is central\nTo what storm front does about um it was securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children uh you know and and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race for that they believe is underway\nYeah the um uh ... hours had had said that um\nHe believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was it instead of speaking about uh you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people uh\nOf only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front\nTo the shooting and synagogue um instilling friend is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere is some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings\nConnected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our\nGlobal is and uh Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to\nBring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the Pentagon yesterday\nMessages with Derek in particular um and I think that is\nHeartbroken and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels small ways ... and he wanders and how much of the re messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into incidents like this and there was central to creating a\nPhrase white genocide and said the popular I think the movement to then somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a ... I think it's it's haunting\nEliza fast slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white

and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now and seeing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli Sasha low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included fast though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to is like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like yeah but in popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy is being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody in that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism what did they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did bully\nAt things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the ... the Clintons to word [noise] um\nRacial is racial out ... over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from\nThe KKK to white supremacist to white power to white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still\nEffective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter Eliza ... who wrote a book about black

going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire\nIdeology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end\nFor me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your races and nebulous thing that that\nThat is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nWas a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nOn the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this Fisher how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those was how do we go into define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front but there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and be a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Jared black

placed a magazine [laughter] you must of publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and

it the RV an A. dot org\nOr not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did a and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that it\nWould have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after it we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd is it effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know\nJewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people to back off\nIn addition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was\nA civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of ... out and made it clear to him how how awful and how aid for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah\nWho won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through and and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself could be transformative and I think\nIt's important to note that that's not happening quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick headset\nMatthew in ... in between these dinners would sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that he had said about Jews and and what what kind of case yeah\nJews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a

films ...\nSkaters of that you're in like you were going to be a great skateboard her but\nYou know I yes actually okay and I loved it and it was there was such bombastic personalities such twisted sense of humor now with a twenty year lens on having written this film\nHe really showed me you know a lot of what I think was great about it and what are things that I had to and people from that time had to unlearn what are some things you felt you had to learn from the culture\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life\nAnd more emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm\nI'm at my scars aren't always guards were inside [laughter] ... yeah and just a general recklessness which are related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story I wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through\nCommunity even if that Comey is has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any that for this kid it's still\nProvided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and and learn some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I\nDream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use the word dream would you unreality [laughter] every considered an escape or now I landed a\nKick foot in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated

my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation it's set among a group of skate boarders in the mid

Hill and he's known for ...\nMoney ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early ...\nHere's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were\nClever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because at the nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer\nSo she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn no excuse me she's Michael\nSo OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is done he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nI like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton like [laughter] when are you gonna go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work or when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny and I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's\nInteresting that you have the M fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who\nTend to think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because I mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films\nAnd I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said we are so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are\nYou cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork\nOrange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nIt's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my ...\nSupport for an H

you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] disturbing and I need to talk [laughter] I was like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was ... not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film I think the raping ultra violence was just too\nOf course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this stuff for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best\nI think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk
