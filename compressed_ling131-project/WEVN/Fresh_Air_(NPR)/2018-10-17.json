something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting leak that they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise] and my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's that's why she's been gone all this time now that was a fourth\nGrade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old so I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I got older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand twelve that I share the story more widely\nThat people must have asked you kids must have asked you all the time like how come your grandparents are raising humor as your parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories on my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean it may be true story building skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nThey were better when I was young then when my mother was young they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this\nHad come home from school\nAnd somebody wrong to me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go in their hat [laughter]\nNo\nAt the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know [noise]\nUm they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point where he said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer that yeah you die from well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years is also heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding shower was that Sunday and in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife she'd be over and and I'm In my ... my

class providers are closer than you think is at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nDarkness Hitchcock is here raising your mind\nI Know they were I Know my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had from my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm Joe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front\nAh surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurrent nightmare as as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare\n[noise] this recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where there's force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but then of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um\nYou know where you're writing out scenes is one thing I mean you have a series of letters that make up words and makeup sentences but visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares\n[noise] probably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know ... the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school St building for all those nine years\n[noise] you know grandparents later told you that they often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly were the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know to stigmatize you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\n... art classes and you're in high school and listen to art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing you were really proud to tell your teacher\nBook about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teachers say\nOh he was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face\nAnd his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned and and by that what he meant was mean that that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel\nThis is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a ... a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artists are drawing them professionally at and in that moment uh and and back then the ... the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character so that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh\nI could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset and what did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punches been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style [laughter] don't ignore everything about [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir

I stepped in the other room where the cedar closet is and on a little night stand I saw him again and then on the lazy boy there I saw three handguns annex so that was to handguns and now I'm ...

Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter] yeah it's ... wedding later you when you did that Charlie Rose opening\nYou probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss\nOf his job [laughter] so let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak who is such a mess and all of sorry oh and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played in in this clip by pat and that was wild is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause it wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose ... and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of the family sitcom\nI like that sneak attack into sadness instead and some fun ways [laughter] far north as\nQuick as it kind of sadness I like the final version better [laughter] and and well jak\nIsn't such despair afterwards and feels responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell it's a it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt at a plausible deniability like he's not actively\nKilling himself but he's allowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and book maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed and despairing\nThat he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five what you wrote if I'm an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dimension and low tech does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both Maine to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a ... part of his eulogy\nAnd this is well our net as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around fiercely they'll hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ...\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a note maybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they couldn't imagine their parents to be anything they wanted\nSaid something to long for any way we did this one season finale where Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was to be in the living his life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the worst rose to water\nBe careful lobes of the way of letting you do but Libya just thinks the horses jealous and when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger ... Olivia gone for good and that of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from\nCourse that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show you shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy to show would be over and above all else the show\nHas to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there's nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he indeed are are fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that\nWell you know I I I think a big part of this episode\nAnd a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and even in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself\nAnd I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better\nAnd be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurts so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how to reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement more so so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter] I'm One of the funny things that you've come up with\nFor the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you awards you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the lead for\nSure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented or a ... we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things\nAnd the rate was kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe more forgiving\nMaybe this is sadly relevance a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were\nDescribing this thing that's been happening for years and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nBut it still feels like we are not you know we see Carrie did a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation are there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer planning their comebacks I think that there is work with those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I found a tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is Rafi

R. comes from listeners like you and from our him Davis providing investment management trust services and financial council throughout northern New England with officers in Portland in Portsmouth information that are in Davis dot com\nA budget horsemen which is now being shown on reruns on Comedy Central\nSo watching the series especially like after the eulogy episode I would've thought that you were a bitter mental at a very troubled childhood reading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell\nYour parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rent a Jewish bookstore your father helped Russian Jewish immigrants in the U. S. um tell us a little bit about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto in the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even\nAfter a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nOr extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of ... that were shipped\n'em and we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says happy Halloween cause it's missing an end you have the misfit toys or rocket go um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life um and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect we joined being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live and sophisticated now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew\nAnd you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nSupport for an H parents live stream comes from you our listeners and from service credit union supporting businesses throughout New Hampshire from dictionary development projects to fundamental thinking needs programs and services designed for businesses who are ready to grow more at grow with SCU dot com\nIs people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know especially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey set it because there's people that look at it and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years they'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around them\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't and\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants don't fit [laughter] inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're pushing the boundaries I did because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect to this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shout out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's\nA ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other\nDisorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is TV like a safe space for you or you can like\nYourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like\nJust like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them um so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it's a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting into the story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running ... which is the Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one um what's that like for you because\nYou in retrospect ... like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to\nKeep their dignity as an up\nSort of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing that looks will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much it is my pleasure thank you so much\n...
