we will not showing the movie\nThan Vincent Price in a scene from the Tingler directed by William Castle castles low budget shocking height made him a hero to today's guest screenwriter and director John Waters\nWaters started his own filmmaking career setting new lows in bad taste most notably with the cult classic pink flamingos his film hairspray which was adapted into a hit Broadway musical was an affectionate and funny much to the teen dance shows he used to watch in Baltimore\nLast Sunday the Baltimore museum of art open to major exhibits devoted to John Waters running through January six it's called John Waters indecent exposure and he's the first major retrospective of his visual art in his hometown of Baltimore\nA companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other works that inspired him John Waters has been a frequent guest on fresh air in two thousand four Terry interviewed him about an exhibition at New York's new museum of contemporary art\nIt was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry ask John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the new exhibit at the Baltimore museum of art including a photographic sequence from the movie Peyton place\nHe told Teri why that Phil means so much to him\nPlace were first dirty book I ever read I Love grace metallic was it I've never read the book the Wii of Betty's crotch uh-huh [laughter]\nAbout dirty but uh in Nineteen fifty six that was pretty dirty\nAnd oh it's a great you ought to repay plays a sequel to it it opens up Indian summer is like a woman for a [laughter] but grey metallic is you know has that famous author shot of her on the lumberjack gotten a dirty ponytail sitting at the typewriter\nAnd I was so obsessed I even went to her grave I went in her house where she wrote the book\nBut painting plays itself on the book came out I remember the ad campaign is how did they make a movie out of Peyton place or something like that\nBut when ... got to a sexual scene they would cut short cut away shot of symbolism like like if someone was frigid they'd have a frozen lake where if somebody was getting turned on made show up blocks\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in is rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she's just had her entire face tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor that will do well that's all you can you got to deal with what you got\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interested in things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other direction if he could well I might as well plan up to the hilt and envy you know take on oppose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took on\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have any advertising no one knew what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter]\nI was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was hippies just didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outside of group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes and in the beginning underground movies when I made them they were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen\nBelieve me that was to go over very well at the time but at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked the Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy is how she pronounces it um so I I wasn't I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did a newer version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the role of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's a scene where divine isn't drag just weird dried but with no way gone because we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously and he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines where there were many off at the time fan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean a pitiful version\nBut we have the shelf for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divine as waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lose in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue\nAnd a and a and then it is scored to classical music where there's one note that as the gun shot and then divine crawls over the top of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed\nSo primitive way that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah sixteen millimeter grainy over expose\nThat when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later\nIt began to look like the real the brood are filmed them one of the most famous a millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm an ... I I I did a a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a ... well I Believe in the art world that the frame as the hype the frame as the advertising campaign\nSo to me it was too big for one wall and it had to go around the wall [laughter]\nI'm In and food for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with design when this film that you're referring to play against the Kennedy devine was a very heavy man who who usually played a woman in your movies and pattern himself in some of those rules on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time whether\nThey were square at the time you know I think ... divine help make drag queens ally Hepburn they all wanted to be best Myers\nAnd [laughter]\nUm so it was they were really square they weren't happy ever\nNow all drag queens or hip I mean you see in the stock and they're all really funny and they have a sense of humor and they have funny names everything\nBut but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest in Philadelphia oh I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous\nA drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous and much more\nFunny and had a sense of humor about it and used to being a drag queen as as being um comedy terrorist which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that your work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business [laughter] so what he said\nThat was the ... thing I ever said I didn't mean to be snobby believe that most everybody secretly imagines himself in show business\nFor a little bit depressed because there are people are fab there in a famous America\n[laughter] I guess you really needed to be famous [laughter]\nUm well I I I certainly can't complain about it I hate to hear people that are in show business for complained about\nAny of that kind of thing what what on earth did you pick rep field to go in for if you didn't want people to recognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all that\nThat we base a life on having to get approval of strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\n[noise] you know in your book there are lots of skills of movies and I'm not just stills from movies that were transplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter]\nYou also have failed to jail yeah but you also have a couple\nOf photos of of ... and how to duty not not known as the most but okay next\nArab bell yes he was psychotic what kind of was the first thing and I was on the how to do to show my parents took me I was on the peanut gallery NBC Studios Clara Bell was a psychotic clown who never spoke who honk the horn and shot him in the face with seltzer water\n'em and you know captain kangaroo unclear about the same person imagined that life\nI I think ... was um a frightening and the best time for the water was the first psychotic person I remember from my childhood his character\n... played clarinet yes\nIf I knew that I felt was a couple of ... if he was he was the first clerical\nHuh so is that your first brush 'em let's let's let's be real show business being in the peanut gallery of that duty show\nAnd I felt was fake it was all lie and Robert and be disillusioned child I was in on the secret and I wanted to stay in on it\nSo you did public shows as a kid

I think I have it in this book we're\nUm her mother had Alzheimer's and she for years so she knows a lot about Alzheimer's community and I asked them to people forget if they're gay or straight they'd workers had never once they don't know who their family is in a wreck anybody but no one suddenly doesn't remember for gay or straight\nWell doesn't that prove really about you're born that\nRight okay so I Want to quote something you say in the book you talk a little bit about being in therapy and you say a psychiatrist once told me early and treatment stop trying to make me like you and what a sobering welcome smack in the face that statement was yet somehow every day of my life is still a campaign for popularity or better yet a crowded funerals [laughter]\nIsn't everybody in show business I'll do the same thing that they're insecure people that have to go into a field that were strangers have to tell them they're good for the rest of her life\nI figured that out a long time ago um yes I thought it was a great singer of a shrink from that I'm not there to make friends you're supposed to talk about other things and making them more uncomfortable but I'm paying for the first get my money's worth so I used to after that going to think of the things that made me the most up to like to talk about which is what you're supposed to do with a psychiatrist [noise]\nUm I Believe in talking to her you know Freud said the best thing ever a redline that's I think so brilliant is turning hysterical misery and to comment on happiness what a great great long\nBut I find it such a paradox and let you spelled out sever that you're the person who has like defied every convention in your life and in your art the person who you say even even you're a minority group you're an outsider of\n'em and I mean you turn that into an art and and a career and yet he tried to get your psychiatrist to love you and you say that every day in your life as a campaign for popularity isn't that a paradox [noise]\nNo I think it's probably being a healthy neurotic everything that I'm running out of your own or not ... enough but only a neurotic\nCares if everyone likes them you know and and in show business certainly it is a it is or politics all the same thing you have to get people to like you\nI'm and by writing books by making movies and everything I think you're continuing to do that and a crowd of funeral is a nice thing I like that but the older you get the last chance that has happening not so now the reason for my younger friends [laughter]\nSo they can fill in like it'd be Oscars when somebody goes to ... to have somebody to sit in the seat I Want family [laughter]\nYou know because as as you've said you've made a living selling shock will surprise surprise\nYeah and and some of your senses be they some of your early ... does have some very like\nVile we you know repulsive thinking people in the ...
