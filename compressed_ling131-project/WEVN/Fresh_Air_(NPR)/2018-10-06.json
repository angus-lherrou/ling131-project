tore my hamstring or I pulled my ... I didn't imagine\nI couldn't do certain dances that season I did some I didn't do the ones I was really well known for and wanted to do and I waited a few months um didn't stretch it still danced but just at a certain level and then within\nThree months I couldn't closed for the position\nAnd fifth position if you don't know ballet is the base of ballet it's the most basic position that everything moved from and I literally couldn't do that\nSo that was a big shock and I tried everything I tried acupuncture I tried I was going to therapy I tried massage I tried everything you can imagine had injections um MRIs I'm an MRI came back and said there was inflammation in my head\nSo I had my hip drained and\nThe doctor also did an ultrasound and he said oh I see a complex labor will tear healthcare what do you mean a chair\nHow could I get a ...

know it started to tell me what to do and I stopped demanding from it\nSo I had to soften up and empathize with my body and have a little more compassion for it and be grateful for what it did give me which was a phenomenal thirty year career with arguably the best company in the world\nYou know a lot of people think ballet as being um the ultimate in like femininity in like I think it's kind of
