what it's been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationship\nPhoebe Robinson welcome to fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago\nTen years they're near oh okay okay I Know what\nWas the gender or race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women and some people color a few where people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it\nThere's just so way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you write that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of ... you know men and the audience [noise]\nYeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nA and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can ... is that allowed now have to believe it too so why bother I don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going\nTo [laughter]\nUm so I just really got to a place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a ... we did our why why tour across America\nAnd we were both kind of being like oh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves this whole freaking time\nYou don't look to cross you know during mass and saw someone else who looked like us [noise]\nWhenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think sometimes people fully understand\nHow hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have that and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a to do queens that would have been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black\nWomen talking about oh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like mess it up I couldn't talk about why black hair woes and high school with like Laura\nShe doesn't know she's a she's just wakes up and she has to ... like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that makes me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or you know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows\nWhere you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... Kim Fields and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman\nYou write about body image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brand has been consumed with us\nThen not attractive to straight dudes and for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to overcome that 'cause it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gain too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer was no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that self doubt come and so I think what I\nHave done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a scale in a house and make it is not about a number\nIf you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans I feel more powerful\nThe little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots\nAnd again these are champagne problems I just want to ... I Know that but there there'll be like oh yeah they have a size four and it's like that is unacceptable to me\nTo only have a size four is truly ignorant and inexcusable or I go to these like shoots and I tell people\nI'm a ten twelve that's just what it is and there'll be like here's a six it's like how dare you\nSurely it's like how dare you be like oh well we couldn't find anything in your size you didn't look 'cause I dress myself every day I dress myself every day and I find everything I Need to have\nThis sort of a well we only have a zero to four so you either ... or you're you're screwed is not how you should treat anybody\nI Would do these video games and Ninety percent of the stuff I wouldn't fit into and every time I didn't fit in something like I'm Sorry\nI have the Apollo time I would apologize after every single ...

that would make me realize I'm amazing and then we have this happy life together\nAnd so that was one of the biggest lessons was like not looking for this great relationship to sort of defined me or make me realize that I'm lovable\nI just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I had been like found my soul mate on my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placed on yourself\nAnd it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never once they check in and see how I felt about myself\nDid you have to learn how to a fully enjoy yourself when you were not with somebody whether it's going to go

smoke two packs a day\nEach nah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point where said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer that yeah you die from well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years is also heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding story was that Sunday\nAnd the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I Know my wife she'd be over and and uh my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom\nAnd you just like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her notes oh gosh that's dangerous as though they were so lucky the hosted and explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people when they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter and I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this\nThat my grandmother surely had from my mother Leslie because that took Joe's attention away I'm Joe when Leslie always had a tight bond\nSurely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\n[noise] you know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare [noise]\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know whether it's through force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know where you're writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise] probably some\nTime just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know ... the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nYou know grandparents later told you that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't the generation and so we certainly were the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help or you know distant ties you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\n... art classes and you're in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your like your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned and and by that what he meant was ...\nYou want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as a as an educator of the arts and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and in that moment ah and and back then this was the early nineties the\nThought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset but did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comic books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know real one is just have your own style [laughter] don't ignore everything about [laughter]\nMy
