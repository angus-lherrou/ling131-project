Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how Bowers views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement pose is my guest ... is a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred and focus is on the story of Derek Black\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties in a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning\nHe says low welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre the synagogue I thought about your book ... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father done but it's still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he\nDid not pull the trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that\nBut do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and Don work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist\nSlogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word sort of statement of purpose that is\nCentral to what storm front does about um it was securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children uh you know in and saying things like I'm here because of all white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race for that they believe is underway\nYeah the um ... ... hours had had said that um\nHe believes the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was it instead of speaking about ah you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was\nTo sort of cultivate their own reality and\nThat was when he went on gab\nHe saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially\nOne long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front\nTo the shooting and synagogue um instilling friend is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say\nThat the largest reaction on storm front and is is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that well\nThis probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our\nGlobal is and that Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to\nBring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nI've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders and you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think\nGoing to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the radio for years and you're young life is I think it's it's hotter\n... slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white

fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included fast though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like yeah but in popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America\nSupport for an HP

made up insult toward the ... word [noise] um\nRatio is racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist\nTo white power to white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an end cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures are based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still\nEffective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter ... who wrote a

his views when he was twenty to\nHis father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front we're also hearing from Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred so you're one of the things you did you had been home schooled\nSo you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views um but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida there were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were outed by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have obligations with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nI think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to met through about dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart [noise] of\nAh I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthews said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after which I bought him or talk about his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd is it effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people in having Jewish friends did you see you know\nJewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where\nI said this is this is crazy when you to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Dexter information I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was\nA civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him how how awful and how hateful and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah\nWho won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through and and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them and he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners which sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that he said about Jews and and ... yeah [noise]\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and are\nAre sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist with defined as the white race and so ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in Bergen Dawson and that was the\nDefinitive experience of his young life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by ... by by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and\nHad had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history and Derek and also learned German because of his very divergent family
