comic roles and movies like bridesmaids and the heat and for her impersonation of President Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the same name by the Israel\nIsrael who died and twenty four teen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress to Lula bank at and gossip columnist ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flop she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her rent or her cat's vet bill Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by literary luminaries like Dorothy Parker ed ... know coward and the actress Louis Brooks and sold the letters to collectors\nReviewing the film and the New York times AOL Scott wrote me Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year\nLet's start with a clip from the film in which Israel confide your secret to jak hawk a fellow alcoholic who scrapes by an charm wit and numerous scams and hustles jak is played by Richard ... grand each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor\nOn going through all my friends with the [noise] quite\nBy accident I find myself in a rather [noise]\nCriminal position I come from law school today suppose ... except ... I mean [noise] embellishing [noise]\nBeautiful she can check [noise]\nLiterary letters writers little tricks lone mothers\n... if you're not understanding the world of elite collectible literary artifact was was thrilling to be full ... pieces of paper lovers I I Am selling to come home she getting [noise]\nVigil was a waste of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and told the rock 'cause I get a better response because if you told this [noise]\nThe only one with her [laughter] you\nKnow this McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie\nSo congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic did are way\nBut it wasn't called a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise] um I think it's\nA it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic plays so\nThis is an HP are\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's staring and the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] blend\nThe ride on the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay\nNone of none of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of injected into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to terminate ... more like a guy move\nThey said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen they said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter]\nWithin it'd be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes and so ... really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended\nIt was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that\nHorrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character\nAnd I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that we can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fall and said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for\nIs I'm insults [laughter] insulting oh no [laughter] not in real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter] but but the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and there were all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do have to say All right you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... tubes because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no what he what he said to me was he called me on what language Catherine language I mean really what these do not balls to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager ... next door so\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul Bank commercial that's what you look like you're a big commercial couple none of this talk if productive I Would like to read and my legs and kick you end up with my phone\nJust really scaring me this is what happens when you corner you corner me I won't you throw you out to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it and it just goes like\nIs that something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but\nYet live the first time I watched\nThat back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] never say that and the person was sitting with was to sit for watching you say he's set all of it and I\nI didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came up to the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nHow'd you improv insults before\n[noise] [noise] yes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very\nAssertive um characters that you know I think in the heat or especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just it you literally say anything just to kind of can tear people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character and you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun too I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but\nIt's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa McCarthy

off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there\nWhich is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\n... when you went into a regular comedy clubs something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your\nOff [laughter] and you're just like what like what do you like it does it ever worked for you\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members on from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked ... in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think it was at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here\nOK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God I don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands for women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do votes and then talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she is a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what\nFirst of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times oh my God so I Know there's the light oh ever\nPresent or not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light men\nFlashes like ...\nAnd when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know the stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner\nOr manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics because you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah and the feeling other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking and the light kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he is really encouraging me and then I [noise] I got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he can't\nHis arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure\nThat you can act and material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get\nGood roles [noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read your kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like\nCar all [laughter] I said I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like\nWhy didn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily\nEnded because they were outed for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful for you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more\nEmpowered in Hollywood now [noise]\nEvery little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys\nThere has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important for me to its its branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need\nMoney for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and I think the more we we linked up and in ... your strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on her show I've greatly enjoyed it I\nMe and let's continue the conversation some other time\n[laughter] I Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review a new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nIt's fresh air on an HP our hand this fall you can tell you the ... election that will impact future generations of public radio listeners a gift on HBO ... through Europe ... stay plan is an easy way to ensure others will benefit from the trusted programs we provide\nLearn more head and H.

P. dot com slash better coverage\n[noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he\nIs the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones so we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state\nIs also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of state Terry\nI Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been the leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case for restricting voting and what he's done\nIn Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state the federal court actually struck that\nLaw down earlier this year and said that there was almost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law\nTo vote that part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas and over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed since Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobach only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly who's a member of the state Senate an independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race in coal box favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nReduce turn out by ... percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted illegally and twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically ... was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd Kobach had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally\nIn the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach Trump tweeted\nThat millions of people voted illegally\nAnd when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim and showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study\nWho was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nKoh Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nCritical back has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is voting issue called back advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise]\nUm how does that apply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures it's used to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine how many electoral votes each state has\nSo the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time of the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says\nI Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census\nAnd what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question\nAnd then he said it's needed because right now in his words the illegals or being counted when it comes to representation I I don't want to get to tactical hear Teri but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted\nWhen it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation in an area should have what Kobach wants to do is restrict those districts\nIf you did that areas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California\nWould have much less representation than places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way districts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift\nTo Republicans because generally speaking areas of lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the sense is that the areas where these people live will get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and accurate census\nSo where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York and sixteen other states\nAnd basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect on people responding to the question that you're going to see\nHow many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status is and that's going to affect the entire senses and so\nIf the census is unfair to centrist is inaccurate and so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guess is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones after a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights\nAnd look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and how it would likely respond to cases pertaining to voter suppression in voting rights\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n[noise]\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh

P. R. comes from listeners like un from select would helping to create unique seacoast homes with personalized Marvin windows and doors\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society you have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored it by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida\nWhere one point six million ex felons can vote that's a staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida\nIncluding one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony conviction so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote\nIn twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters\nSince the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas in other states Florida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that helped doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent amounts and\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restored voting rights to Seventy seven thousand excelling\nSuccessor restored voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race\nFlorida could also elect the first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million disenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo\nIn the past there have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have been appealed as high as the Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh to the bench what's his position on voting rights [noise] he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights heat\nUp out of voter id law from South Carolina in twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state but a cabinet wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and\nThat sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact new restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence\nOf the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open\nTo potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues\nWas and so now we're facing the most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights [noise]\nAmazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court for limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he\nLed efforts to weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that gutted the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination\nNo longer needed to approve their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread or pervasive in his words and in fact everything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting both in states that were covered\nBy the voting rights act places like Texas and Georgia orange days that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread voting discrimination that we're seeing right now would seem to argue\nIntact but if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fry how pervasive hasn't then\nEvery study shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not nonexistent\nBut incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's very difficult to commit fraud in New York but we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud in New York and the state without a voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have to know what their addresses I Would have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already and\nI Would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine and I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that\nSo it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it\nIf you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting\nA very small number of votes one vote usually most and so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevented from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud or see\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is journalist Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America he's also a senior reporter for Mother Jones who's been reporting extensively on the latest developments in voting issues will be right
