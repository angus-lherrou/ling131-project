include Suzanne so long Marianne famously raincoat Chelsea hotel number two everybody knows power of song I'm your man and of course his best known most frequently recorded and performed song

talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today and thank you for being here when I interviewed her father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs he asked to\nRead a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the frame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with

the way he did but\nThere's something about his work in general not just on the last help them but in this book and in general if she she invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become style jacks ... because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate ing things whereas this man was speaking from the very Ron that he found himself at in

way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is traveling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and\nThere's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have an ... that have his work has a life outside of his mouth\n... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems so I go and how they want

hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or the of course when it's attached to song it's supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry that I'm feels instructional or\nA has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of people quietly swimming to this book and observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line\nTaking their own time not with my meter now with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more post that your father I'm going to fight about being ... can tankers or in transit you\nKnow it's just it's a it's I'd I'd

singing at\n... um but but you are you at your father was a song writer scene must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them and you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older\nThere was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um then you grow older and then you then you sort of see I don't remember um\nI remember I myself\nWas making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain and we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record\nAnd was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said you scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSit amateur move he said yeah\nIt's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um the la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also but their intention out he was holding up the baton that\nHe had been given by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and do something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh\nThat baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember how much did you get to see your father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of a union between two people has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's\nComplications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd uh my father would often even park a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he's always been part of our lives\nHe'd always he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm okay yeah I remember my mother moved to my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived a\nLong dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things and put it to the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh\nYou know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his care of in that for what he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's lives um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nAnd there's something really terrible that happened to you and then in its own way as may be responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm his reconnection to people\nI'm Around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain your father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing insult to sell the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression\nUm and like I think your sister who discovered that it happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um in incredible\nThat [laughter] that with the canon of his work with his devotion to black eating pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when he experienced this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time apps and said made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this most unexpected

medium\nTransforming a military offensive this was the German invasion of France what happened\n[noise] so you had this new technology that are connected everything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population was wireless communication and\nRadio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes or the rise of Nazi ... a said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also Hodge strategic tactical military impact\nOr when the Germans invades France and invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work\nIt not only allows them to connect all their military units in a new manner allow him to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population and it's sporadic contagion of fear\nAnd it's one of these things that contemporaries described as this this strange defeat um they couldn't express what happened until they figured out really radio was what a

hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how fire\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would put out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered then all of us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the proxies of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set of model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line but it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a how they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the costs and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\n... so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what\nCan enlist in Taylor Swift or army of swift ease you can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army\nThe uh cause may not be the same but the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at a crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head you would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion to drive it to your own in\nThe same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson working authors of the new book like war the weaponization of

fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the comment on hearing in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and uh it was in a certain way\nYou hide both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from open source intelligence gathering campaign\nThe online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images\nFrom Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh to ah unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of burying the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona as in the like\nAnd the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative be buried underneath as you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view but history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stylish and learn about history ...\nSo for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian actors go on to ... very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook it was sexual term\nAnd during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week at the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kinds of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms\nAre private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world um and it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the ...\nMove into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also is a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same a chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a and convince someone to take a certain position on a war\nA certain way to challenge also moves into visual imagery there is an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not\nThe companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks are online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to a a battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so these neural networks ... could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden you know honoring some you know profane of comment at something\nTo get real world examples of this there have already been\nCreations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together where for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an examples Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that and meld together to allow you to in essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something\nAnd so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's going to be monetize for for profit and it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...
