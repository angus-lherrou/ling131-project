fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard cons final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished\nAnd it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it I'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about\nNow you know what I don't want to read this phones I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with\nA kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] um\nI'm Wondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of\nJust you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and\nThere's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they haven't met the have his work has a life outside of his mouth\nAnd he and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems\nSo I go and they want to get on record as saying you know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that the contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song\nUh it's supposed to lift and ah and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about reading poetry that I'm feels instructional or\nHas a kind of rigor to it I'm a ... a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of people quietly summing through this book and observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line\nTaking their own time not with my meter now with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more post that your father I'm going to fight I'm not being ... can tankers are in transit you know it's just\nIt's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little disappointing\nBut I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with his from the interview that we recorded in two thousand six\nAnd this is a poem called titles and it was published in\nBook that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also\nThe title singer was kindly according to me even though I could barely carrier tune\nFor many years I was known as among our shave my head's in war robes and got up

father was a song writer scene must have had an awareness that sign writing my craft that something people actually did and ... ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them and you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places and um\nI was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older [noise]\nThere was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um [noise] and you grow older and then you then you sort of see how remember um\nI remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scrapped it and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain how we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record\nAnd I was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and he was scrapped you record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he says yeah\nIt's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that\nHe had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah that baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated\nHome five six and ... the don't remember how much did you get to see us either after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some uh was remarkable is remarkable to me um\nI my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd ah my father would often even park a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he's always been part of our lives\nVeto he's he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm yeah I remember my mother moved\nWhere we live to and there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things we\nPut it to the tea where the road and met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in\nThat far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's lives um the deliberate this with which he\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as maybe responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm his reconnection to people\nUm I ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain your father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing is so we'll just sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression\nUm and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with a song and poetry um in incredible\nThe [laughter] the to the canon of his work with his devotion to black cunning pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I was a festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities that suddenly started\nTeaching is works I'm studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics as liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand
