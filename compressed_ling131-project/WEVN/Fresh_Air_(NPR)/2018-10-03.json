journalist Michael Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says I filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseen well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is is the risk that you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top ... risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the ... now that you've explained why the fifth risk means\nWas the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration gone about taking over the federal government we're kind of lights a fire under me is when I discovered that the Obama administration and spent the better part of a year and\nThousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course at at every been created and in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting the day after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to do receive these briefings or and nobody showed up nobody debris in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nAnd I I thought well this enterprise it's managing all these risks it imagines but we as a society to spend much time thinking about um it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought\nAnd from people's you know the bank in a helping clients pay your bills and managed account using the new mobile labs from people's United bank people's dot com [noise]\nThis is an age PR [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been best sellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among and there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the mother investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on but it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a true we've had a prize the bigger cited it we don't say it doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nOf abuse and scorn and it's collected rust and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know he's paying much attention because of slow\nOh one aspect of the fifth risk is the ... a lot of the risk that the government manages are very\nLong term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they're all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way\nBut they require a long term approach and on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and\nThe public has gone along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done where physicians aren't being replaced where people\nAre being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in a sense we ask atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and ... you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so\nIt's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and this includes National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance\nSo it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there and it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nA and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical\nAnd I'm into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm so here's the problem\nAre typically the person\nWho runs no or as a as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation\nUm the problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut but weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings\nA faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better or all of that saves lives and property or that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property\nCommunicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather can do it instead\nAnd that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to essentially forbid the national weather service from from doing anything\nBut warning ... writing advance of a of a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place is the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that it makes it available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the day to the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts\nBut what he's been trying to do is organized essentially a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option\nLearned more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com\nOffering a tire decision guy to help customers find tires that fit their car and driving conditions\nWith a network of more than seven thousand independent installers\nDirect dot com helping drivers find deliver install\nThis is an HP are it's nine thirty some good evening\nWinter is coming\nAnd now it's time to start planning your skate\nBoard an HP are today and you'll be entered the when not one to one thousand dollar gift\nYou can get out the key Largo Monte ... the Bahamas [noise] you know how to let you have to act fast we're giving away the first card Wednesday at noon and the second and seven fiancee there'll be automatically entered the when when you make your get now at N.

I Would love to have one outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while I think there's at least the possibility of the risk\nThat he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole all that money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a war way of saying that I think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in you\nAre exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt he's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt\nI'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why would offend your trigger a financial crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket um this is the doomsday scenario and I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger a the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it's some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun\nWhen you predict things funding sort of predict things where where ... when they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the ... looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air it's fresh air on an age PR [noise]\nKnowing what's happening in the mid term elections before you vote in November is important\nBut what about what's going to happen in December or January Hi I'm Lawrence ... housing in policy reporter for any just yawn when you give each month and the ... and you will an H.

joining us my guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life\nStarting Paul Giamatti and Catherine hon as a couple of trying to conceive each of them having problems with fertility so they're trying alternate means ivy F egg donor\nKind of you name it [laughter] and adoption um so it's a comedy but it gets to like really serious issues within about marriage and about all the complications I'm trying to conceive [noise]\nUm she also made the savages and slums of Beverly Hills so the movie starts with the Catherine ... character\nOn her bed in her bikini underwear lying on her hip but it's a kind of sexy pose\nBut what's really happening is that she's waiting for her husband to inject her was whatever the Mormon is that she's getting at that moment\nAnd it's a great shot to show how what should be a very sexual process you know what I mean like yeah making love and then conceiving when you're having to go through fertility treatments it's it's like it's injections and\nPills and you know all this stuff that's like\nIt kind of it's going to have an effect on your body because you're you're ingesting all these hormone yes [noise] yeah um and I said can you talk about that shot can you talk about like framing it as something that looks like it's going to be really sexual erotic it's not [laughter] and there's also sounds\nSo before you ... you kind of come into the senior hearing Paul and Paul has an amazing kind of whisper your voice and she sang scoot over and you're hearing brass Senate sounds sort of like a your overhearing kind of a bedroom\nScene and then you arrive and then it's a shot of Katherine slower hunch\nUm you don't see any heads or it's not attached it's kind of her lower body a laid out on the bad and then Paul arrives\nAbove her and pulls her underpants down a little bit to expose sort of her hunch and you see a wedding ring any lowers at and then he says are you ready and she says yeah and he's like okay here we go and he starts counting one two three and you think they're going to like try some neurotic act\nBecause there's all there's preparation and instead he lifts up a hyper during the ... needle and an interim muscular needle and you know spears it into her but and then you got wide and you see wow\nThat is not a sex scene that as a medical\nSituation [noise] and and to compare it to a pregnancy that instead of the has been putting\nHis hand or the partner are putting their hand on you know the president belly feeling their baby inside he's kinda like stabbing her with needles in her belly and her and her head and I'm\n... ... ... again it's just it's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having a baby and let that can be life it can lead ride that moment but that process is just so\nSo different yeah it it's\nPretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination you you're lying in a you know kind of a stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in the stir ups [laughter] and if we're ... a clinic from the point of view Catherine ... so you're seeing a doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view of yeah there was one of you so many women have had so many times [laughter]\n[noise] um yeah and um the um the doctors don't come off very well in your movie was that your experience I actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ...\nAnd uh he it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about the fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the Catherine ... character is a writer and she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies and her agent\nThat's why you listen

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character so you made\nFeature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when you live with your father and he moved\nBeverly Hills and he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there and it was just like a weird weird existence your second filling the savages\nIs based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had\nTo move him to um a a a nursing home and he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise] I'm In part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type 'em right and there isn't a strange men need between\nYou between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so that is unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies\nIs um is family and you know the\nComplications of having one and wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has made you so focused\nYou know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean it's [noise] I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother we live with our father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your Mother's Day arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me\nUm had been a living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Marion high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to move with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents know when we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother [laughter]\nYou know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and [noise] um\n... you know we our lives improved\n[laughter] that's cool [noise] which was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "03"}
