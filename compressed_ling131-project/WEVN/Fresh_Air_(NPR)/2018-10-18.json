Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYes we were later you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who was such a mess and all of Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up ... caught by putting Oswald is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd yeah when the allegations are against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of a family sitcom\n[noise] well the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist\nI liked that sneak attack into sadness instead and some fun ways [laughter] far north as quick as it kind of sadness I like the final version [laughter] and\nAnd jak isn't such despair afterwards and feels so responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWhere I Would say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in ... maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed and despairing but he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of\nThis is well or not as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously they'll hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ...\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network had a note\nMaybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they couldn't imagine their parents to be anything they wanted they had something to learn for\nAny way we did this one season finale we're Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got herself cleaned up and she was to be in the living his life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the horse to water\nBe careful loves have a way of letting you do but Libya just thinks the horses jealous and when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger ... gone for good and reporters because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. L. through the gases stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on this show you can't have happy endings sitcoms not really because\nIf everyone's happy to show it would be over and above all else the show\nHas to keep going there's always more show and you can call horse in a round dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he ended our our fans because they can't imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um let me do you think about that well you know I I I think\nA big part of this episode and a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and too easy for giving us a public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better\nAnd be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement more so so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter] I'm One of the funny things that you've\nAnd the writers is do we forgive you awards you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the ... if you watch\n... but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about house additives that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things\nAnd they're able to kind of like ... back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized bad and then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me\nI don't know maybe this is sadly relevance a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for\nYears and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know Louis C K A stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and and Matt Lauer planning their comebacks I think that there is work that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nAnd I guess since ...

S. um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so and mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I'd sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty\nJews and never felt a extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were chips\nUm we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says happy Halloween because it's missing an end to have the the misfit toys or moderate go um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew\nAnd you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nNow and I said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate\nOh and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't and\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're pushing the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shout out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I thought I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is TV like a safe space for you or you can like\nYourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that\nIs that like there's so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them um so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes but I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer\nAnd having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it's a funny situation I you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting into the story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running ... which is the Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one um what's that like for you because\nYou in retrospect ... like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's\nEpisodes down to you know add commercial breaks down or the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to\nKeep their dignity\nAs an upset of television not edited out have you been to important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this work without those moments and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also saying look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and\nHopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing that folks will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much it is my pleasure thank you so much\n...

reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here get a sense of French from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak for\nTrump was a remarkable builder and in New York's history and he was the guy who had built and sold his first home before you reach the age of twenty\nBy the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of homes you're by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest\nDevelopers are actually in the country and what he specialized in was building middle class housing um whose homes which she built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens or committee is no frills\nHomes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford hum of building in Brooklyn and queens and his uh and so we had enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies\nInto a ... billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity and suggesting a power and ultimately it's what he jumped paint on very avoid to win win the presidency\nAnd so this story really by sex that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um in based on the actual documents an entirely new financial narrative of the forty for the president\n[noise] let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David Barstow of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on a President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans he got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engaged in suspect tax games as he

writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings\nAnd how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father\nIn his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars acquaintance two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw about ... what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise] um we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to for Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for many of his adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support died it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history\nIn Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to lose father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nIt also see that when his cell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them there's one spooked just almost\nMoment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is the time\nAnd the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money\nDisappearing million dollars right there was no chance three and a half million dollars worth of casino chips and at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period\nHas a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's well centrally and do well and it was caught us all to the will is taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nInfrared Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and ...\nImmediately says no he freaks out and he\nMakes the call to his daughter who is\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family and what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think is that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this\nAs an attempt by his um to Jane\nComplete control over his estate and potentially to use the umpire for Trump\nDoggedly impatient rebuild over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially those collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Susan ... after a break we'll talk about another skiing used to

Suzanne ... and David Barstow who along with Russ Buettner published a long investigative article this month but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... di Donna Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why to Donald Trump make that decision\nThe interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that for a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would\nKeep it and I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why he sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check and then in two thousand and three\nIt was time to sell and quickly assembled a private sale to a dollar per in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo that the the uh buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death out there including all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about died as we learn through the ... the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down and Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay\nA few million more bucks on this returning if ... million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract\nA few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who hire the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated\nManeuvers to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more\nAt the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking a gift and the state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments and deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or another comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication\nIt coincides with the time when you're actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tracks schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually costs it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession\nOf twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene it's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan\nWhen in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump built and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nThan that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked and I think that we've\n... dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were\nAnd how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves um but I think it will take time for this just sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times says basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it who is allowed to go you know [laughter]\nWe uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] I thought it was great but we uh yeah it was just the three of us for a year um\nWith a yeah it's a pretty messy but a little right the ...\nThe item imagine [laughter] and other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell thank you for your
