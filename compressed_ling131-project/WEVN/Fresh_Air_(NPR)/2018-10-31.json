no ambassador for skateboarding\nAnd skateboarding so sensitive\nTo being portrayed in film by outsiders and that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was\nMaybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more in my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um\nThe treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I don't know just laid an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our

you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early\nScript here's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts about maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because if my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because at the nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn\nNo excuse me she's Michael Sallah OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a\nK [laughter] like Congress Diane Keaton like when are you going to go legit you know [laughter]\nBut ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work\nWere Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny and I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or\nOr even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said\nAre you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned in the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder film couldn't win over my head so I just took wow this is diversity of and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk show [laughter] I was like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film I think the rape and ultra violence was just too\nOf course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this do for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and\nI think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess this Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of

now has Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch who replaced\nAfter Mitch McConnell block President Obama from choosing Scully a successor and Brett Kavanaugh who replaced Anthony Kennedy after Kennedy retired\nNow the chief justice John Roberts is also considered the most likely swing vote in a court that has five conservative justices my guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful it\nAlso includes profiles of several of the justices the book is based in part on ... interviews with several of the current justices as well as past justices sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration [noise]\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict tell each justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life as it is and enduring for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\n[noise] in what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nThe court docket is almost entirely discretionary the justice to decide which cases they want to hear and too often they choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left\nTo the political branches that cheaply means Congress or state legislatures and they do so for a variety of reasons but I think the threat that runs through [noise]\nThe views of most justices most of the time and I interviewed a majority of them for this book I interviewed them on background and I can indicate which ones I interview that was the terms of the deal I the attitude you get is if not us who will do show some will look out the window in point that the capital\nIt's hard for justice to recuse himself or herself at a lower court you can always substitute in\nA new judge you can't do that on the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit

in a sexual harassment\nCase there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true partisan shelf in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence\nYou could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nYou know or the Republican interest where their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one having said all that they are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize\nJustice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that Thomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February that lives in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas\nWith stories of other women decide they need a Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas so it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was silly generous it was\nKavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts ... I think it helps to uh in feeble\nCongress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act this 'cause they know that the justices across the street will act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become I'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings\nAnd front insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in the case\nI think they're all kinds of\nLegitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference at the White House was a ... of a justice\nBut I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system which has lots of flaws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure\nYou really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can't do anything at that point other than tweet so I think by and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\nI hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with a Gorsuch nomination and you say some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\n... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination this was during the course that nomination why was he called ... ... ... to lack that's\nAll they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives won and instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we ... I won't go into details\nThought was a measure scholarly legal opinions saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst him not happen to think that Kavanaugh on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave been or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict the capital will be closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional as him his affection\nFor the court and for its own reputation may lead humans on some occasions to rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively show\nThe Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and then in that direction than for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David a caplin former legal affairs editor at Newsweek and author of the new book about the Supreme Court called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution we'll talk more after a break and\nKen technical review singer songwriter ... new album I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nAnd you buy our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air\nAnd its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance\nOffering its home quote explorer shoppers can evaluate options in one place one by whom insurance costs some quotes than rates are available on mine\nLearned more progressive dot com [noise]\nAnd from love me and makers have go to a meeting a collaborative meeting hot point over Eighteen million monthly use are\nDesigned to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more and go to meeting dot com\n[noise] hundreds of black women are running in federal state and local elections this year\nBlack women have been the most reliably bowling constituency for many years for the Democratic party and so this is about more than just respecting our vote but he is about respecting an honoring\nOur leadership I'm Ari Shapiro surgeon black women running for office this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News all things considered\nComing up at four here on an HP our\nSupport for H.

Kaplan author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nHe's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek so we have to Trump appointees on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh was an originalist\nWhich means are interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written and not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas\nConsiders himself an originalist or attacks journalist I say that not really understanding the difference between those two terms but um is Gorsuch are Kavanaugh\nAn originalist or texture list or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they were both call themselves card carrying ...\n... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a a a trope\nIs that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot there is no clause in the constitution that says thou shall interpret me\nBased on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nLet's say you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow at the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights you say that originalism favor as\nA status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course\nThe constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things in such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents or senators\nI'm to use their own judgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution\n[noise] do you think that justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because the selection process that we use now in the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen to go some of their stellar credentials those were unnecessary requirement for getting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they vote the right way\nIn the same way I think that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was chosen by Bill Clinton in ... Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues\nThan you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes\nHeightened it wasn't always that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies and it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees include how\nMitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control of Congress or this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together and they're not really good at playing dirty\nStakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require a constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court pack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house and the Senate or the White House in twenty Twenty one I don't think\nCourt packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back the Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals that an eleven member court ever six five majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and how old is your third against but now\nAnd how old was a John Paul Stevens' when he left\nYet so I mean you can say for a really long time um so a lot of people are ... it's a pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah [laughter] um so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people\nBecause now that people are living to such older ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written\nUm the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was ... cousin part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise] um so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment why do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have\nWell would lower the stakes of any particular nomination if for example there was a single\nTerm of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I endorse I think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make current justices leave it would allow every president to get to nominations you'd have a new justice every\nTwo years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country if it was just\nAny bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be um nine of twelve maybe it will be five of twelve venue might\nActually give forced to the idea that the court is a neutral body it rules based on law not personality not based on the political views of this or that justice\nBut that these more anonymous lower court judges and the chief judge is of course are rotated based on seniority the system might look\nMore like we have long imagined it to be the idea that the court is politicized is not a new issue it's just far more dramatic\nThan it used to be and it cuts against what we all learned in civics class which is that the law is supposed to be neutral or a government of laws not men and women and so forth having said all that any of these changes are incredibly unrealistic\nBut they have a Kevin thank you so much for talking with us it's a pleasure thanks for having me David Kaplan is the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside this", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "31"}
