host Christopher Kimball [noise]\nToday I chat with Rene ... author middle and Appalachian Journey with recipes we talk about pickle bologna and what most people get wrong about how people watch the mythology\nOf Appalachia in that we're in this modern culture the current information and it is is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated [laughter] and we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks rough scotch Irish [noise]\nBefore my interview with one day I checked with work landscape well known for books which is hard and soft now in his latest book for when he tells the story of milk [noise]\nMark how are you I'm great how are you ah well I'm thrilled to talk to you um I read cod was my first ... book a long time ago a new latest book milk I also found to be at least is interesting is caught\nSo let's start at the beginning I guess the philosophy people believe that the world started with a huge drop of milk [noise] yeah I mean a lot of cultures have creation\nMyth that involve mill and I guess it's not surprising because milk is associated with it\nOf life well but but some of those examples were great that the north legend the huge frost ogre sustained by cow made from falling frost vicious new churned to see of milk to create the universe it it was more or don't don't try this at home [laughter]\nI can turn a glass of milk and just as good a military um the thing you say is interesting is that what forty percent the Chinese today drink milk\nYeah which is interesting because that's actually the world average about forty percent of people in the world drink milk about sixty percent of the people in the world are lactose intolerant\nBut but the theory was and you explain it that you need lactase to digest lactose in milk and the theory was the Europeans do not have the gene the cuts off the production of lactase when you get older\nWell everybody is supposed to everybody who and they get to about two years old this enzyme lactase is supposed to ah\nStop working and then lactose become sins adjustable some people and that tends to be a Europeans middle Easterners subcontinent have a genetic mutation where this doesn't happen and that's why they can drink milk\nIt's interesting that this mutation that we have is presented as normal\nAnd the normal people are presented as having an illness [laughter] that's true actually lactose intolerance is what's supposed to be friends um\nYou said there was just a shocking numbers at Eighteen hundred it was a double in hospital that had Ninety nine point six percent infant mortality rate\n[noise] yeah I mean what was called artificial feeding feeding children animal milk was not a widespread thing until the Eighteenth century and and the Eighteenth and Nineteen century it caused huge infant mortality rates\nJust kill lots of children especially in cities\nAnd given the odds I mean in New York City more than half of the people who died were under five years old and most of that was from milk so given that that was happening is an extraordinary that people still when I'm giving kids milk because of this belief that you have to give children milk\nI think I did and that you know you're fine you know just don't leave them out forever and the good thing about your legs it's they're really fresh which means do beat up beautifully because they are so fresh\nThank you so much I appreciate it take care thank you Beatrice say\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball if you have a ... question please give us a call at eight five five four to six

[noise] well I\nRemember hearing on your show I already paid for eight grade\nOr something to put on steak when you're ... ... ... ... ... and I looked and looked to try and find something like that so I'm Wondering if they can get me some idea of wave pomegranate and Iraq and very simple recipes\nLike for really chicken or steak or eight and vegetables anything like that\nYeah you can um it's available on most of the supermarket now my Mooney which is the brain we so we think is the best but how do you spell that M y M O U and puffy\nAnd that's great but for grilling you're probably does matter I Would just brush it on either in the last thirty seconds of grilling straight up straight up or as soon as it comes off the grill you don't want it on very long 'cause it'll burn\nThe other thing I Do with pomegranate ... a small amount to have been a grant her dressing it's as you know sweet and sour and then just add tremendous steps to that so those are two of the things I Do with it and just as an ingredient sometimes I'll put a little at a stew just add a little bit of deaths sort of a secret ingredient\nBy any kind of meats do I find meat and pomegranate ... go well together\nAny beef stew parks do lamb stew at the end you can put in a tablespoon of Palmer minimal losses just add a little depth to it and nobody will know what it is but it just adds flavored\nYou're adding a little bit of sweet and sour yeah\nI find is probably one of the most useful pantry staples I have if you want to make a tip of some kind of he goes well in Greek yogurt you can add a little bit to that along with some fresh herbs or other things other spices but I Would take lazy and vinegar credits and adding to students are three things I Do Sarah\nLike yeah all of that sounds good to me I mean for people who don't know what pomegranate molasses is like it's a little bit like ...\nWhat I might do for a glazes combine it with a little bit of butter and some Dijon mustard and that just put it on in the end you know maybe a little bit of garlic\nNow you're French or fight it but I Do [laughter] All right Terry thanks very early on you have a\nListening to the

[laughter]\nSo how many miles how long you set out to do this trip is this a pilgrimage um what were you looking for and how long were you doing it\nHonestly I'm not sure what the ... which is at one point I said four thousand miles and then I started looking back at my records and it's really a lot more than that [noise] so it was quite it was it was very literally and journey you know the subtitle is an Appalachian Journey what's recipes\nAnd that was important to me 'cause a lot of what is written and has been written about um the people and the culture and the food ways of Appalachia\nWell a lot of comments from one person's perspective and their family but there are other experiences in Appalachia and I wanted this book to reflect those as well we hear the mythology of Appalachia is that we're this monoculture hum\nThe current iteration of this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated\nOr irritated but mostly because everybody thinks Rob scotch Irish I'm so they're they're actually the last census\nThere are more people in southern Appalachia who identify as Latino are African American there are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my point in my interest is that if you look at the food way\nYou can start to pick apart the complexity and see all the strands of it and see how it comes together and it will challenge uh some of the assumptions that we've made many of the assumptions that we've made about on the Appalachian\nA perfect poised to talk about food so you are you say chili bonds carried out from the Dixie pool wrapped locally in red Greece licked wax paper were my favorite [laughter] okay so now now now defend that so so these were really good and you're like bugs or what\nOh heck yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain\nA chili bond is not a chili dog that's the first thing to understand there's no hot dog in it it is a very fine grained spicy chili mixture hamburger mix here that it is packed into a hotdog bond with onion and with mustard\nAnd the texture is extremely important that it's not like a sloppy Joe it's it's not kind of slurping around in there it's in there or being I'm\nFrom and the best way to think about this this is this is a dish that was Jim my knowledge born in the pool halls and what you want to think about is if you're in that pool hall and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat you don't want something\nWhat Chile on your hands right\nYeah you don't want to get something hot and and that but a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make your slide a little better\nSo let's talk about some more food you know this really through the ... sweet and savory banana pudding\nIt had powder jolt of the custard okay I can give you that what has red meat pace red man of the ... no no wait a minute now that that's a that's a milk street thing when you're ... red meat so into a savory banana pudding what's going on\nAnd well we are being first of all true to the Appalachian palate one of my mother's favorite terms\nAbout taking a food food that went from pretty good too oh yeah yeah buddy or she would say it had a wind to it and I and I think and joined me Chris I'm campaigning to make that an official coronary term ... what does ... mean\nEvery hill and valley was named for reason minister hills swearing hills southeast quarters wrote in bear mountain\nAppalachian takes its name seriously to\nLogan giant greasy cut short or the names of Appalachian beans\nToday things are named by marketing directors in Appalachia named till real stories\nAbout real people in a place in some lucky people even get to call\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen a milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto general\nJ. Mario I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was well gave her base was better than ours but you went to Italy yup to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nYou know one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything wrong\nFirst of all our ratios ingredients are way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough ... they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist without\nAnd we use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they spend their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course produce the thicker more luxurious sauce we think we have to fit it beforehand that doesn't work\nI also learned that we get the order wrong and the order in which you add ingredients to either ... or ... or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the base for example into soon you're gonna over process that are over ... and that's going to give you the wrong\nFinished consistent so your goal here is to get a pesto that's pretty dry it's not a green sauce right it's dry\nExactly it's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it\nAs a soft before it touches the pasta but really if it's that lose then you've added to much olive oil and in general ... done until it's been added to pasta with some of the pasta water then it's considered passer and then it's considered a complete but that's why I say we are way too much olive oil we think supposed to be center at an earlier state so\nWhat's the order of the ingredients I'll get\nThe orders very important again 'cause you don't want to order process the ingredients so you start out with a garlic to find out to salt and you're going to reduce that too and I find pace that he's usually distributed through the faster\nThan we had our cheeses you want them finally ground add those in and again you add those to the pile up in the garlic and you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the chiefs\nNow the ... goes it but what are the things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the ... and like they do in Italy reason is they use\nOf the few times and it's done our case most of the ... we find at the grocery store tends to be kind of bigger and a little bit heartier and we had trouble getting it to the right to system the without over processing it and try to get into a watery puree but\nThe solution actually was pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on the cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of pulses and we're done\nI Would assume anyone in general we use the food processors just as probably persona non grata so is this is good as what you had in general\nWell get lax the romance of bashing it with a mortar intestinal but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of right there we modified it enough with the war that we're getting really close and I got to say\nIt is delicious so Jim ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is good at least as the real thing thanks Jim Baker\nYou can get this recipe for pesto other journalists say one seven seven

what you have right now or do you want it to stack\nWell interesting you should ask this question because for years I always cooked it in a sauce pan you know which was straight sides and act like you said but um I had a wonderful young woman work on my last cookbook home cooking one on one and I asked her to contribute a recipe and she spent her junior year in Italy\nAnd she'd learned to make ... says she did a very unique Rizzo do but she cooked in in a large scale it\nAnd she said that's what they did and so now I'm sort of changed my opinion\nChris well our editor Jane her she was just in Italy getting results a lessons near belong or in Milan ... yeah and they cook it in about ten minutes to cook it very fast ten or Fifteen minutes they don't do the long slow thing\nSauce and so the whole notion of those thirty minute low and slow it was just complete nonsense that's not how they cook it what kind of paying its a wider paying like a scale it yeah yeah that's fine\nBut this whole low and slow doesn't really that's fascinating matter stirring all the time you know they started off stirring and then they just let it cook and stir occasionally so you don't have to stir constantly either\nLet me guess as this recipe going to be in the magazine courteous oh dear I didn't look at my last\nYear oh no I'm In trouble I'm In trouble so we've been reading blown up and to you know I may do that that's OK so which issue with it in September October yeah okay\nI Would say a larger surface area is a good thing yeah\nWonderful thanks Megan thank you so much yeah right take care
