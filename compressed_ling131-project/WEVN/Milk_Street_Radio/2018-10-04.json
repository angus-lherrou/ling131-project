still find inspiration in the kitchen but first we chat with food writer Anthony ... about the real Australian cuisine what are the most culturally diverse cuisines in the world [noise]\nAnthony how are you fantastic right how's things over there probably not as interesting as things where you are based on your article what is Australian food really it sounds\nMore complex and more and more international than what we probably have in Boston so they just give us in a couple of sentences you the basic premise of your article well I guess\nWas trying to sum up we were always been searching for you know ... is a straddling cuisine and I guess we've been room and I think about it and really wanting to wanting it to be something and then I think we've just to a matured and ...\nTrying to create a dish that is a struggling food it's actually foods of actually about the communal to title and convince the Audi and [noise] and I guess the best way to define it for me is that who we are sort of defines what we ate\nWell you said that the top ten homelands of those born overseas in order United Kingdom New Zealand okay then China India Philippines Vietnam mentally South Africa Malaysian Germany Greece's the close eleven so\nI as you point out you're more likely to find a Chinese restaurant in a country pub and not massive Italian immigration the Nineteen fifties so the idea of a model culture is just totally not true it's just it's a totally immigrant couch\nOh absolutely and I think the perception globally of a strategy or is that you know we sort of ex pats from Britain and the the reality is obviously a indigenous community it's been here for over fifty thousand years and\nThe rest of us have all been here for a little bit of a two hundred and we've actually come from all over the place and you know a stray doesn't have that rich sort of a\nPeasant sort of food culture that you have like in France and Italy that creates these dishes\nOr the centuries you know we've had to rely on everyone else in the world to sort of common share their food with us\nWell what are the things you mentioned which I should have occurred to me but didn't was obviously Southeast Asia is very close so the climate is perfect for growing many of those ingredients lemon grass singer meant chili base along gallon goal so it was like I never thought of Australian those terms\nWe we are we were tropical you know like I grew up with passion fruit vons on the back fence we had ... and the ... you know it's there's some parts of his dry that I get below our shorts and thongs whether it's pretty warm but you know there's there is cold weather as well as ... really big\nPlace that you can basically grow anything from all over the world here and in that Scott what's been happening\nSo let's talk about some of the food you talk read brace ... tail which tastes like sweet veal with the hands of gaming is with black bean and Chile or roast duck with sour native peaches and ... what what are some of the dishes that you know I obviously would not be familiar\nOn the juices come out of the mix with the rules give that really wonderful dark sauce it'd be great base for gravy you could use it as a base and beef stew with I think it's stocked base almost right\nYeah I mean two things for people who don't know what a Louisiana ruins all about you take the butterfly our stuff that you usually cook together at Thanksgiving tip that can your turkey gravy but\nYou cook it much much much much much longer until it gets a very dark color in it and that kind of ruined our crew was added to a gumbo not just for sticking power but for its flavor\nEspecially Fritz flavor it's a very very important part of Louisiana cooking however\nThe longer you cook the flower the less at will thicken\nSo when you're adding it to second a grave you have to keep that in mind that's all but so you use it as a flavoring component I can see that and I agree with everything that Chris just said and by the way I think that is brilliant to freeze it 'cause it's work to make a darker how long has it taken the Avon\nOh goodness the amount that I make probably six hours while\nI'm sure in the oven I Would say probably around three hundred yeah three to three fifty and you use oil or you use butter\nOr ... I can to use locally sourced free range\nAnd this is not there now you're taught on man you're the real deal yeah now you're talking that's terrific\nIt smells amazing what I usually do is a one to one ratio but your weight but I don't know if you've ever tried to like the Chris but a lot of people in South Louisiana say that week is the way we never heard of that racial\nWell now you're talking with the pork fat there I think it's got ... I think you know we need to taste to make sure it's okay yeah I I think also go great in Chile and you do freezing ice cube trays or something you have portions are\nSomewhat small cuts like court size or maybe a little bit smaller cuts and then I'll just use the scoop like a little state was still scoop an eyeball it\nThat's terrific we applaud that's the best idea of her and yeah that's right or good for you and thank you for sharing that with us I think we benefit from this conversation\nThank you they are gong are they going to the fabulous yeah thank you yeah the ...\n... you're listening to the radio I'm Christopher Kimball coming up next my interview with China garden we'll be right back\n\nSupport for Christopher Campbell's milk street comes from regal where makers of Nineteen Nineteen cookware cooking happens in the kitchen but life happens around the kitchen table American Made stainless ... cook Ware learn more at Nineteen Nineteen ... dot com\n[noise] support an HP are today and you could win a trip is a lifetime to land down under are lucky winner has the choice between Australia or New Zealand which means you'll have to choose between kangaroos are ...\nThe bright lights in Sydney opera house or the stunning views of mouse cook national park [noise] support the news you\nAnd you'll be automatically enter to when they get now at an H.

budget analyst cater and small store owner to being one of the most loved and recognized home cooks in America in her latest book cook like a pro honor focuses on how to cook not just what to cook\nToday we tried about how she turned to small gourmet shop into a huge success and eventually a career in television I Know how are you\n[noise] I'm fine how are you Chris oh it's been a while it has since we last spoke up so everyone I think knows your story and we talked about it but you worked in the White House\nHas a budget analyst on a nuclear energy budget and policy papers seems like another lifetime ago see I was like to have to go but you know here's my question you you see this ad for this ... square foot specialty store on west Hampton\nBeach ah Long Island and you said well you know maybe I should do some of your life [laughter] and then all of a sudden you moved out there [noise]\nWhat what was that you were really bad at because going from policy analyst who are retailers so different what were you really bad and and what were you really good at and in the door at the beginning\nBeginning I think I I did everything you know when when you have a store and you have to employees you do everything so you bake bread and new make cakes and new um [noise] I mean you're everywhere and I think it was bad it following through because I'd start something and then start something else\nAnd I remember going home one day and and I forgot that I had like thirty Kara cakes in the oven and came back to the next day it was a disaster [laughter]\nUm I think when you when you have a situation like that and you don't know anything about it you just jump right in and you just do everything and I think I was probably bad at a managing my life because I was there like twenty hours a day I go home sleep really fast and come back again but I loved it so it didn't feel like it was\nWork it felt like it was it was like a huge sandbox and I just had so many fun things to do\nSo was it hard translating you're cooking from home cooking to retail cooking when you're making thirty Kara cakes that requires a totally different mindset in terms of prep and how how you organize yourself from the kitchen did that take time\nIt took time to actually scale things up what I did was I ... when I bought the store it actually came with a notebook of recipes that the woman who had been running for for me so she made pies and she made some things in quantities\nBut I kind of wanted to wrap it up and make it a little fancier and what I learned really fast is that people didn't want fancy food they want to good home cooking and so I remember making things like a you know some ... there was a Swedish dish called ... temptation I have no idea what it is now it's like potatoes and and\nAnd herring or something and I remember I nobody bought it of course and I thought well we'll just have it for staff lunch and the staff didn't even know [laughter] so what I learned I learned what I mean actually really good example of it is I remember\nI'm doing I thought well I'll just make roast chicken but I I wanted to put it out in a really nice way so I had a big platter and fresh herbs on the bottom and I have roast chickens on it and nobody bought any and I thought ... ... ... what's wrong with it\nAnd then I thought it's to fancy and so I took the whole plot or back into the kitchen I took the chickens ever put them in this little red and white paper cups that you have for French fries and I'd line them up on the counter and they were gone and five minutes\nAnd so I thought what was interesting about what I was doing is that it was I Would do things all the time and I'd watch what what if people like what did they not like where did they want to buy parmesan cheese that would put parmesan cheese all over the store and I got oh that's really interesting they want to buy it at the register on the way out\nSo so how how much of retailing is impulse is fifty percent of it impulse born\nWhile I think a lot of it is I think a lot of his ... as being smart and people would come in and say oh I just came in for a baguette and they walked out with you know fifty dollars worth of groceries so I think it's about visuals I think it's as if\nThey're things smell good they taste good it's fun being in the store it was always important to me I Would walk out of the store and I walked back in and say okay what do I hear what do I smell what do I see well what's interesting and um we had samples out so you can taste things which Frank Sinatra cranked up on the\nCD player and a and it was just fun being there I I Love when people would just say oh I'll just make you a Barefoot Contessa\nAnd while they were there that you know they get coffee in a muffin or something like that\nSo uh the name Barefoot Contessa was the name of the store when you bought it is that where it was and now as\nI looked up the movie because I I doubt it wherever gardeners actually dark movie well that's what I was going to say to you I mean as you know it ends in a multiple murder\nAnd able to just shot so the Barefoot Contessa dies at the end of the movie I thought that was so interesting that barefoot contested and most people has a somewhat happier [laughter] failing somewhat\nI think it's the image of being elegant an earthy and actually when I bought the store I thought the first thing I'm going to do is change the name because it doesn't say what it is has nothing to do with food doesn't say who it is it doesn't have somebody's name it was just an idea\nBut as I started but I didn't want to do it right off the bat because it was known and I thought well maybe over time I would change it but I realized what it is the idea that it's really about being elegant an earthy\nAnd that's what I think have a garden and was and that's what the for the movie was about and in a funny way that really kind of captured what I think the store is\nYour your your brand is interesting you are um you know you're my generation a yet you really have I don't know of cult status was right but you have a very strong following large front and you can fill a two thousand feet theater for example as you well know [noise]\nUm so ... and you're doing it from a brand that is about comfort or and making people feel good about their home in the ... and could you just talk about that because it's so antithetical to what you see today you know with social media sort of the opposite of what most people are trying to so I I\nOkay so it makes me so angry that I Want your life\nI think my life I Do oh yeah you do you look more in words [laughter]\nWhy are there have been an artist thank you it's been a while and and uh I Will be happy to wash the dishes and [laughter] and they tell you to come for dinner I'll wash the dishes bill either thanks thanks so much but\nThat was on a garden and her new book is called cook like a pro\nMagician obscures the true for the loser for the benefit of the audience the trick itself is usually mundane presentation I make so much different\nOther careers which has food off are really the same allusion\nTo make it to the national coal miners to records grits practice during while overtime making it look easy\nTo garden does make it look easy but don't be fooled the likes of Martha Stewart

[noise]\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen a milk street to chat with when Clark about this week's recipe roast chicken scenario and great Chris you know interviewed Nigella Lawson recently on the show and she mentioned the term in her new book called ... which obviously is that he was term and I wonder what it was and it was chicken or chicken parts\nAnd you bake all this stuff with it on she was all happens once so I like the ... him and I liked the idea we brought it back to the kitchen but we thought we'd take that concept and adapted to something else so we have chickens we have a trade now what are we going to do\nSo we have bone in skin on chicken parts here you can mix that up you can express dies from sex whatever combination you want here\nThink on a ... with us spice Rob\nAnd this particular one has coriander ginger salt and pepper and sugar it's faith in the oven\nFor about forty minutes at four fifty and that allowed us to get the crispy skin we wanted it also created um find on our pan which was another opportunity to make some flavor and add something different to this very simple baked chicken recipe whether you're just teasing me\nI Won a special thing we're going to do so we're going to make\nThe sauce right on the sheet track initially we just ... the pan and use that ... kind of make a quick sauce with lemon juice and fast\nBut what we found was we could add something else onto the tray and so we added ten garlic close actually onto the tray it goes in the other with the chicken so that roasted in the oven gets really nice and sweet ... cents off you just snatched the gun\nWe're getting the water and the lemon juice and the herbs and it creates a really nice pants size on your ... which is a Pam like typically we think of ... it's all done right on that hot seat track\nSo you bake the chicken parts in roast the sauce ingredients on the same thing and then you actually make the sauce on the high ... read it like that they're using it
