father grew up in the south your mother was from Guam what tell us about one ton of Florida ... what was the community like\nWell I guess it was an interesting place I I Would say it was lower class living it was not the best living situation\nContrast to ask for a lot of great things\nWell you you're right that there was Jamaican Cuban Haitian food and culture so the food must have been really great\nYeah definitely there was a lot a lot of wonderful I mean like Jamaican beef patties you know cabbage and peas and rice\nAnd then on my father's side you know like\nThings that my grandmother made just really really hardy um delicious\nSouthern food you know I'm a Mac and cheese um [noise] she made this delicious spaghetti that had I think she will catch up in it which sounds strange now but it gave it to this nice sweet and um so it was definitely a of a wide range of of flavors that I grew up around\nAnd you and you also write to you when you were fourteen you were overweight and uh you became a vegan or as a result of you so you really changed your entire dog yeah when you were to\nNumerous I did um I think a lot of it was me trying to find myself a lot of it with me trying to find my identity within all of that\nSo by becoming vegans that such you apart from your family your brothers and sisters who were so leading the traditional diet\nRight it was it was a stark contrast you know like our dinner or very meat centered and you know starch heavy because a lot of it too you know we're trying to feed a large family on a on a small budget so\nThis whole concept of cooking from scratch was born because I had to be creative I had to think of a new way to create this food that I Love and I want it to taste but that fit by diet and another\nThing you write about is negligence in the kitchen but as waste could you explain that [noise]\nI'm Talking about um how I Would watch the food network as a little girl and how I Would see this huge contrast between all of a white woman with money\nNavigating her kitchen space versus what was reality for me and I know what was reality probably for a lot of people but\nEven just the way that we approach our resources you know you don't have a lot of resources and so when I Would watch either a garden in particular make these huge feast for just her and her husband and then she would leave [laughter] like access food and the ball\nSo you need the equivalent of a loin cut very expensive I mean we have to be a line cut for quick cooking ... you can't use like and you can't you shoulder right okay well you you like it just would be chillier yes gonna be chewing and he didn't\nWant which is what I've been doing yeah just because it's an easier cut to find and less expensive and I have another side which is salt ah yeah I mean I've always put some salt but right before your cooked 'em just before I cook it\nWhy don't you try something that I had a dime tossing it with all those other things and then you know padded try or just ... ... ...\nSo it gets a nice here I bet you the salt would make a difference okay\nYeah well I I Would ask them just asked them about ... what kind of isn't the way they get their land with him\nIn the search for this I did buy like a leg that uh hello butcher sawed off away um for me but ah that that didn't really help a and that was a young land but I was young enough that it was um\nYou know hard to work around the leg getting off of it so yeah to\nLikes tricky I mean I the salty for two hours on Iraq is a good idea\n[laughter] yeah yeah yeah crank ... shots like thanks

I've spent years failing to recreate the dishes that I end the generally due to lack of the ... and\nEarly I'm having issues with the issues that are in their smaller slightly sweeter and of course ... the north American ... but they don't just color like red onions do after long cooking and they're far less sweet than the daily as a ...\nSo with onion forward wet curries like a ... or even something in the background like a butter chicken you end up with a great career you if you attempt to red onions or accordingly me curry if you go with ... or something like that\nOr just something that's probably true sure every usually there's just too many onions you're using standard larger American yellow one\nLet me ask a question ... yellow onions are sharp when they're raw but in our testing it milk street we find they actually turn sweet do you find is just the amount of on you or do you find the yellow onions are still two overpowering when cooked\nA ... you know what it's a bit of both but you just end up with a completely different volume of onions solid\nI Know it's there is going to say so yeah he knows what I'm saying well how about ...\n... you know they are sweeter than a yellow onion but not playing Lee sweet\nI you know we tried to Charlotte it's just not the same the flavor is a very different\nI mean if you're big complaint is volume I Would think just a yellow onion\nThing I Would think getting the spices right and using whole spices and posting them and doing all the things you should do will make much more different than what they're using yellow or to paint onion right I mean that's really the crux of it hopefully next to you agree with that assessment\nI Would agree with that and you know the sort of side bar here is also the total lack of a veil ability of genuine Kashmir issue which ends up being introduced many of those that creates we'd given that color and everyone tries to clocks related with a kind of the week up that's what you\nKnow yeah that doesn't make sense you know one serious cook\nI Want to come to your house [laughter]\nWe do our own cereal smoking weed you our own fermenting a building a salami actually out of\nA natural scare I visited salami cage I've never met someone who built their own that's pretty cool I Am super ... yeah now we're in the end we not helped you at all\nBut yeah thank you so my mom always said was less yellow onion that was really in addition to Helen airy dilemma\nWell you know what I appreciate thanks yeah yeah I haven't really good okay\nTo abide by\nThat should be in my

Berkeley California with an overload of ... but maybe without a lot of day to day restaurant experience but over time shaping these prospered the kitchen or it's chops and Alice went on to social activism including the edible schoolyard project\nIn her memoir coming to my senses waters explains what shaped your view that food can be an instrument of social change\n[noise] let's go back to the beginning so you're young you grow up in New Jersey and you say I get dressed it was so cold in the house in the winter I get dressed down in the basement by the furnace where my father was shoveling coal that is almost Dickens quality [laughter]\nYou know so you actually had a coal furnace and ...\nOn a cold winter morning [noise]\nWell I did because he had ... to ... to heat coming through the radiators\n... to that's that happened every morning and my sister and I wear sleeping way upstairs and the addict part of the time [noise] uh if it's cold [noise]\nUm my favorite story though which I Will repeat our radio since you wrote about it was it the Montessori school and you had to you had a child who who bit ... who was a biter\nAnd you could cause when you think what your sister when you're far her or you used to buy back and you actually bit him back\nAnd I don't know why I guess it's not funny but the idea of Alice Waters in the ... school biting back a child who's a biter just I don't know it just struck me somehow so ... ... exactly what happens\nIt happens very impulse I wasn't used to being around really young children and I certainly hadn't been around any that were misbehave and I didn't know what to do\nAnd I was about twenty six years old and I I had to learn the ... message tonight tried to [noise]\nTo interest him in ... you know the projects and and he chose\nWouldn't stop and I ... when he heard another child I just grabbed his arm I [noise] I didn't I didn't hard [laughter] but I was ashamed that I did that and um\nI thought that I was ... with being let go from the school because of that incident\nBut in fact it was instead because I was wearing [noise]\nI'd rather miss cake last [laughter]\nSee through blouse [laughter]\nAnd then you went on to other things so let's talk about your parents you said um there was a wonderful thing you wrote about your mother before she dies you said speaking to you you live the life I wanted to live so ... what does that mean\nWell no she was a communist [laughter] and um she just felt very strongly about how much money people shouldn't be can and should accept really\nKnow here yeah you know it is such a simple dish and\nI guess that's what attracted me to it because they're such simple ingredients but they have an amazing amount of flavor and an hour max that they bring to the table\nAnd it didn't hurt that I learned it at this crazy winery that used to be owned by the mafia apparently the government took it away from the mafia and gave it to a retired stolen art inspectors around in the meantime of course of course because it's Sicily\nAnd as it turns out his personal chef was willing to teach me basic rustic Sicilian cooking and this was one of the dishes she taught\nThe minute I walked into her kitchen I was just blown away by the richer Rome is a federal and Rosemary and garlic and it turns out that what she'd done is frozen ... into a pot that had been soaked overnight\nFor in some wild federal but she grabbed from the driveway of the winery\nA ton of Rosemary and garlic cook to them away and when the beans were done to Austin some pasta started altogether and it was a ... good for such a simple collection of ingredients to have such an amazing flavor profile there were layers of richness and ... and yet there was no dairy in it\nSo why is this different than the eighty nine versions we've all been through\nI think the problem with most versions is that the focus is on the basics here the beans are kind of like a starchy counter punch to the rich federal the rich Rosemary and the garlic I mean those are really the dominant flavors that you're getting and they're married in this kind of like ... starchy liquid from the beans and from the pasta itself\nAnd said the result is really rich and creamy an aromatic and again for such a simple group of ingredients it just has an amazing impact and flight\nSo I assume when we got back here did you make any alterations so that we\nDid we made a couple of first of all we simplified it for weeknight eve we use can beings and we were very happy with the results because in part the can't be have that structure water you need to get the creamy sauce that we were looking for\nThe other thing we did was we found it was a little heavy and we wanted to like new up with that\nAnd I'd eaten the dishes second time ... and that time the woman making it added some tomatoes ... so we borrow that to kind of bring a little bit of a city to it and finally we felt that a little bit of lemon juice and lemon zest also help tie everything together is right there and it also really played well with the Rosemary\n... as I say you know a basic recipe but now authentic and a much more interesting yeah and also not very difficult very simple jammed thank you\nThank you you can find this recipe in all of our recipes one seven seven milk street dot com\nI'm Chris Kimball you're listening to milk street radio

I've got nothing left to say but what censorship sugar is the corn syrup\nUsually five to ten percent of the powdered sugar staying with a shortening are fat I'm shooting for on fire to enter a sign that seemed to help but after heating and cooling maybe that's causing the ... station or you\nKnow the other things I can think of is like the doughnuts being too hot or the glaze thing ... when it goes on to the donut\nWhy do you do you take the doughnuts out and play some right away or you let them cool a little usually\nLet them call like up to an hour or so before I get to them and then the glaze I'm trying to get as close to just warm as possible\nIn the industry when you research before you open the shop did they say to glazed doughnut sit there at a certain temperature\nPool is what I've been reading and scenes from other industry folks I must say Reshef by\nTrade so there's this sort of new to me the whole construction side of things\nI Would think that if they cooled\nMore stable adherence between the clays in the doughnut 'cause if it's cooling there's steam coming off\nI don't know yeah I I Would try perfectly cool doughnuts and see if that helps you know\nLet me just turn with an al ... um you know and I glazed doughnut just at home you know with a simple plays a powdered sugar melts and Ella usually I've been advised to let them call very slightly and to put the glaze on air warm\nYou know maybe try and very cold because you've got a heated plays the glaze I Do is not heated more try him right when they you know like four minutes five minutes out of the oven\nHave you found that it depends on the humidity of the day or the temperature outside or is it ... absolutely so can I come to your shop and get a discount on the ones with the ... [laughter]\nSo maybe maybe guy well no maybe Sticky Fingers scout yeah moment Dickey finger maybe that's a I didn't turn it into marketing plus yeah that's not a bad idea [laughter] no I Would try different temperatures and I would play with the percentage of corn syrup just double it and see\nIf that makes a difference I haven't done anything that hire you I was just doubled and see if that solves the problem because that would be an easy fix about food\nAnd want a donut yeah chase you did a good job there man hungry and good luck with accents\nI Love the show and it it's great to talk to you guys and yet\nThey care about I welcome to milk street who's on the line\nHi this is this level it how can we help you\n[noise] ah so I guess about a year ago I read the uh Giuliani wrote that seven o clock on Indian cooking\nHer description of how to capitalize on ya and [noise] and it's different than the way I learned how to care minds onions which is to sweat the onion almost as soon as they get their hands with salt sunny\nDoesn't mention that putting in Salt until like very ends and ever since then I've tried it both ways and I have basically not been able to the ... onion sense\nYou mean that whole thing ... you say your onions don't care\nAnymore I got ... I don't know oh dear\nI think we just cycling [laughter] this is psychological ... amount of writing it yeah [laughter] ah Chris what do you\nI just did it last night I ... I did a low and slow and a Dutch oven assaulted at the beginning a steroid them every seven or eight minutes was fine let me ask you how are you doing it let's start with that\nWell I guess I keep it on a medium high and no salt\nNo do you want to keep it on low [noise] to do with low and slow in some places they just fried onions you know you put them in a skill I was a bunch of oil and that takes about ten minutes but if you want caramel ISIS low and slow I mean French onion soup\nIs a study in ... you know a bunch of onions for forty five minutes ... white wine you keep doing that four or five times and then you get a dark\nRich soup [noise] same concept but it's always low and slow right\nSort of always loan so because the thing about onions is that the same thing that makes our eyes water", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "01"}
