some your host for chemical [noise]\nOn the today show I speak with Krissy Clark about how one consumer crusader Ruth Desmond use a peanut butter controversy to change or food regulation system [noise]\nA lot of what the FDA does now and what it was doing back in the time of these peanut butter war I was trying to figure out how many peanuts shouldn't there be and peanut butter and should it be a hundred percent peanuts or if not then wish into line be drawn and that quickly becomes an existential question even if you think it's a really simple question at the beginning\n\nWhen before we dive into peanut butter to check in with reporter Shane sheeley visited the bus station in Tel Aviv to get great Filipino food [noise] Shannon how are you\nAnd good how are you good um what started in Tel Aviv on a Saturday afternoon Sabbath there is a very large bus station two and a half a million square feet they're ... let's start the story there\nSo on Saturdays in Tel Aviv are pretty slow days and most people including foreign workers have a day off today of rest public transportation shuts down a lot of the shops are closed people go to the beach and the bus station it's pretty much shut down\nFloor which transforms into sort of a little manila there is a food market and it comes alive with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Filipino workers I stepped in line and started talking to some of the women there\nOn Saturdays how many minutes are coming here you know the average meeting their friends\nThey are eating some deep you know that he got these that they are setting here\nSo women Filipino caregivers who have their day off basically they got off work they go home and they'll either start cooking friday night or early Saturday morning and they show up on the bus station\nAround noon they'll bring these like huge plastic Tupperware it's filled with warm noodles and stir Fry's vegetable dishes little plastic containers full of desserts um and they set up these tables\nIn the hallway of the bus station there's also produce markets so they sell produce that normally you don't get in Israel so cause solve our route lemon grass\nDifferent bitter chords that you don't normally see in an Israeli grocery store and we'll all be like stocked up in the bus station and they come not only to eat and to have these single your foods\nBut they also come to hang out with friends and see relatives and people who they knew from the Philippines to see how their work is going in to chat about work and life in Israel and life away from their families in the Philippines\nFor us federal really being nosy it's how people like happiness for\nTo give us relief you know from one week\nThat they were all people\nSo ... how did you come across a story in the first place how did you find a force for the busters\n[noise] so I was reporting based in Jerusalem and I spent a lot of time going back and forth from\nTel Aviv to Jerusalem and on Saturday nights I Would notice that the bus station just sort of had a different vibe and so when I realized that there is a Filipino market there started spending more and more time there and what's so amazing to me is that\nThis is how ... what happens on a call in show like this everything's fine until about five minutes fall and tell me what happened why cooked it over my barbecue who ... out in the Senate if at a number\nWell you're right sugar is high gross carpet attracts moisture it has a huge effect on something like a custard pie\nBecause the chemistry so\nGo back and use the original amounts and take it out when it goes in the center if that works then you know you solve that problem now the question is how much should be you can take out especially with the cranberries I Would think that could be a problem you might have to add an extra big that's a very delicate chemistry\nAll right well Iowa certainly try that says thank you so much for your and say yeah we'll see what happens now

right stuff you get it to your door tomorrow that's what I Would do I've heard about what actually being used the question is what kind of ... I mean what do they do within that yeah I Would go get the right stuff\nBut by the way I Do have a question I assume it's a very specific type of corn growing for this right it's a ... a lot of the kinds of feel corn I mean is this a\nRight that was another thing that came up we grew and Italian variety\nI Can't remember the name of it off the top of my head but I did notice the colonel's look a little bit more like popcorn but it's marketed as a Flint corn like something you know what you or\nPull and ah we've made cornbread with it and things like that so that was another thought that I wondered if that would make it more difficult to make money so it the the colonels or a little bit smaller points here at about popcorn is\nYou know you can buy muscles [laughter] me [laughter] I mean you're you know let me just to understand that you're doing this because it's in either perfectly agree with you this is just a cool thing to want to try to do right right yeah\nI think it was an episode of fear is that they're talking about corn tortillas and how the flavor was better if you made a ... fresh compared to like using Martha her you know like the stuff he at the store that's dried\nNo I I don't think we were saying grow your own field corn boiling by mixture [laughter] pouring off get rid of the ... boiler for four hours I think we just meant that if you made your own mixture at home instead of buying the ...\nAre cheese no uh companies that make you rich and ground corner finance and mills is it it's an ...

to Washington area homemaker decided to fight back and she changed the way food is regulated here in America reporter Krissy Clark produced a three part series on the peanut butter wars for marketplace and she's here today to tell us the story of the peanut butter grandma\nChristie area I'm great thank you so this all starts the late fifties people are manufacturing peanut butter that's not all peanuts right\nYeah often in significant amount not peanuts or at one point in the Nineteen fifties right after just came out these rumors started popping up that uh\nThere were in certain batches of Jeff at least only Seventy five percent peanuts and then other suspicious ingredients making up the difference\nSo is it the ... is a problem or the quote unquote suspicious ingredients wait what if the rest of ingredients were perfectly healthy wonderful things doesn't really matter\nWell I think that is a big question that a lot of folks were debating at the time the the ingredient in question that I think raised a lot of alarm bells was a critical there was actually in the factory formula [laughter] at the just plant\nIt was up to twenty percent Crisco and peanut butter and for some consumers this was a shock um and some folks\nDescribed it as it was a tantamount to having peanut flavored cold cream [laughter] yeah that that really doesn't hydrogenated fish boil doesn't

by putting less and less peanuts and the peanut butter and a ... children that are eating these peanut butter sandwiches mostly in here it's just peanut flavored cream\nRoof Desmond was a homemaker herself\nA very spirited very determined woman and so she got really interested in this issue she started reading up on a lot of the science just about food in general and food additives in general when her husband got sick with bladder cancer and she was trying to figure out what had happened and wanted to be feeding him healthy food\nThis was a time in American history where food was really transforming and it was after World War two and the two biggest industries coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our foods that\nEither people weren't aware that it was in there or if they didn't know they didn't know what it meant a and so one day when she was probably in the halls of the FDA she ran across this notice that mentioned that they were proposing a standardized definition for peanut butter\nAnd ah when she discovered that what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put a lot of this hydrogenated vegetable oil into\nThe jars of peanut butter that she was by and she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers and a flood of consumer comments started coming in to the FDA hundreds literally hundreds of letters here's Jen it again [noise]\nShe said I Will tell everything I Will get all the facts and I will laugh it to everybody because everyone needs to be an\nSo she called herself and the ... and that's what she got and that's what was in our news letter you know telling people all the hearings and what was going on and the bills in Congress she put it in her newsletter and\nSo uh one of the things you pointed out is that from the FDA's point of view this was a labeling issue in other words if you just honest about what's in it it's okay and roof I think at a different point of view she didn't want\nAll you have to do is look to India for example and then you have the spices and all of a sudden this is as good as eating steak I mean it has a tremendous amount of flavor\nThat's right it's got a lot of flavor it's a great vegetarian dish we add a little bit of tomato at the end I\nAdd those yellow split peas to the dish those are really thick and creamy you serve it over rice with a cucumber pickles and yogurt you can um as they do and visions restaurant

I get I\nWelcome the street who do we have on the line on the ground and they couldn't Hi Brendan how can we help you today\nUm I got some green coffee beans from a friend of mine and I just don't have to do it I Try to roast 'cause that's where I needed to do with it really know what to do with them either so\nAttractive swirling around here for a while and uh they kind of started letting off these real paper ... skills worth it yeah it is to go from green point because the color to burn it yeah\nThat's what they do Crist's you've done this now about ten years ago I went through this whole process because I Love coffee and uh I bought a number of different roasters sort of the the popcorn popper where the their air rated and they they go up in the air and swirl around\nI did the rotating drum roaster the more expensive one\nAnd here the problems first of all a lot of smoke\nSo you have to do it underneath the hood of some ... ... New York city apartment secondly I found that ... beans had a different roasting time and temperature and so it's very complicated to get a roast right 'cause otherwise someone to burn and some of them are green and he has this problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better than actually was worse than beans I could just buy at the local louder may place for over ... so I think the problem is you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right\nTo get the roasting the flavor right you know and the good thing about green beans is they hold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time [noise]\nI never had much luck these things are expensive and there's a huge amount of smoke given off so\nI really wanted to make this work but I just go to gave I finally well yeah I mean and also the quality of the green beans you're buying you know that's a different issue to laugh I think buying roasted not ground beans and there's so many good suppliers out there right now but that's the easy way to go well\nAnd let's bring any kind of guy who likes to get involved in long projects\nUp on that kinda stuff I've only got a couple of pounds of these green beans I don't think it's worth it for a great\nOpening to maybe do it just sort of like in a pan or something easy\nTo go and spend three or four hundred dollars and get a rose starts getting hot bath and we found is second\nHand you know a popcorn popper you know to thrift store it might be worth it\nI Do find now versus ten years ago my local place there's like ten different kinds of beans and\nOff of the other thing I find is I like lighter rosy light to medium roast getting the the roast just write with these things is also a little tricky tricky so anyway there you go\nTo thank you so much okay Brendan thanks for calling calling already took her\nThis is mostly radio I'm your host Christopher Kimball please give us a ring the number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three eight five five four to six nine eight for three or send us an email at questions of milk street radio\nDot com welcome to the street who's calling Hi this is the hand Casey how can we help you today okay\nSo um you know I loved it in the kitchen love to cook my one weakness I think is with desert\nThe one problem that I have liquor there it happened to deal with the ... in the ice skating the decoration presentation all of that I Try a lot of ... if you get home from my own thing and I think but\nThey never seem to work for the icing try that out or sugar with milk and vanilla thing it always comes out right ... ... and then I tried to cream cheese one in the mix are also doesn't work\nWhat happens to the cream cheese when\nIt never really become credible like I always even though I keep it at room temperature I always feel like it clumps and never has a great consistency and the taste is always just not there so how can I make really good for us think and I think that at home\nI agree with you that the powdered sugar isolating pretty ... yeah I really ... you can add like orange juice to anything but I I don't orange that idea they never turn out now I don't like him a chocolate processing always worst nicely because of the chocolate cools it sets up\nI'd like an Italian ... or it's whispering which means you beat egg whites are and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup\nLike at two thirty nine to forty the temperature doesn't actually matter that much and then you drizzle it on the egg white says for beating them and the mixer for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice\nFluffy frosting middle hold nicely ... a day or so it's not that hard to do but you have another no I was just going to say the boiled frosting which is sort of similar involves egg white friend now which is sugar water egg whites ...\nBut the thing about the Italian see you add the sugar served the egg whites there's also the Swiss where you heat up the sugar in egg whites and hook up to about one sixth day those are a little tricky you want an easier recipe for crossing I assume\nI mean that's what I Would prefer to start that way I can kind of build up my confidence and start working with something a little bit more advanced\nI think the cream cheese frosting though that is going to give you a good texture and that's going to hold really well to\nOkay and I wonder if maybe that's more technique issue with me and not maybe really knowing how to work with my next or\nDo you have a hand mixer or stand mixer\nA stand mixer\nAnd what happened you said it was just the text you was to stiffer\nIt's like the cream cheese still state kind of clumsy\nOh how long did you leave the cream cheese room temperature before you made the frosting\nMaybe an hour to an hour and a half\nThe only thing I can suggest is to take the cream cheese ah cut it into pieces", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city": "Keene", "day": "18"}
