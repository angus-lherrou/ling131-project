had a moment when I was looking at Madison Avenue and a woman in Big Sur cut said oh darling Latvia cookbooks and I said thank you very much and kept going and about a black later a truck driver pulled over and leaned out of his window and said hey show and I thought that's what food isn't that it appeals to everybody in\nThat signed a garden we sat down and discuss early career and how she still find inspiration in the kitchen but first we chat with food writer in the ... about the real Australian cuisine what are the most culturally diverse cuisines in the world [noise]\nAnthony how are you fantastic right how's things over there\nProbably not as interesting as things where you are based on your article what is the Australian food really it sounds more complex and more and more international than what we probably have in Boston so they just give us in a couple of sentences you the basic premise of your article\nWell I guess I was trying to sum up we were always been searching for you know ... is a struggling cuisine and I guess we've been room and I didn't know about it and really wanting to wanting it to be something and then I think we've just to matured and ...\nTo create a dish that is struggling food it's actually foods of actually about the communal to the table and convince ... and I guess the best way to define it for me is that who we are sort of defines what we ate\nWell you said that the top ten homelands of those born overseas in order\nUnited Kingdom New Zealand okay then China India Philippines Vietnam mentally South Africa Malaysian Germany Greece's close eleven so\nI ... as you point out you're more likely to find a Chinese restaurant in a country pub and not massive Italian immigration the Nineteen fifties so the idea of the modern culture is just totally not true it's just it's a totally immigrant couch\nOh absolutely and I think the perception globally of a strategy or is that you know we sort of ex pats from Britain and the the reality is obviously a indigenous community it's been here for over fifty thousand years and\nThe rest of us have all been here for a little bit of a two hundred and we've actually come from all over the place and you know as straight doesn't have that rich sort of um\n[noise] peasant sort of food culture that you have like in France and Italy that creates these dishes\nOr the centuries you know we've had to rely on everyone else in the world to sort of common share their food with us\nWell what are the things you mentioned which I should have occurred to me but didn't was obviously Southeast Asia is very close so the climate is perfect for growing many of those ingredients lemon grass ... so it was like I never thought of Australian those terms\nWe we are we were tropical you know like I grew up with passion fruit vons on the ... we had ... and the ... you know it's there's some parts of his dry that or get below shorts and tones whether it's pretty warm but you know there's there is cold weather as well as ... really big\nPlace that you can basically grow anything from all over the world here and and that Scott what's been happening\nSo let's talk about some of the food you talk read Braves ... tail which tastes like sweet veal with a hint of gaming is with black bean and Chile or roast duck with sour native peaches in orange sauce what what are some of the dishes that you know I obviously would not be familiar\nOn the juices come out of the mix with the rules give that really wonderful dark sauce it'd be great base for gravy you could use it as a base and beef stew with I think it's stocked base almost right\nYeah I mean two things for people who don't know what a Louisiana ruins all about you take the butterfly our stuff that you usually cook together at Thanksgiving tip sticking your turkey gravy but you cook it much much much much much longer until it gets a very dark\nColor and and and that kind of ruined dark room was added to a gumbo not just for sticking power but for its flavor\nEspecially Fritz flavor it's a very very important part of Louisiana cooking however\nThe longer you cook the flower the less at will thicken\nSo when you're adding it to second a grave you have to keep that in mind that's all that so you use it as a flavoring component I can see that and I agree with everything that Chris just sad and by the way I think that is brilliant to freeze it 'cause it's work to make a darker how long has it taken the Avon\nOh goodness the amount that I make probably six hours while\nI'm sure in the oven I Would say probably around three hundred yeah three to three fifty and you use oil or you use butter\nOr anything I can to use locally sourced free range\nAnd this is not there now you're talking on man you're the real deal yeah now you're talking that's terrific\nIt's amazing what I usually do is a one to one ratio but your weight but I don't know if you've ever tried it like Chris but a lot of people in South Louisiana say that week is the way you will never heard of that racial\nWell now you're talking with the pork fat there I think it's got ... I think you know we need to tasted make sure it's okay yeah I I think also do great in Chile and\nYou do freezing ice cube trays or something you have portions are\nSomewhat small cuts like court size or maybe a little bit smaller cuts and then I'll just use the scoop like a little thing was still scoop an eyeball it\nThat's terrific we implied that's the best idea of her and yeah that's right or good for you and thank you for sharing that with us I think we benefit from this conversation thank you\nThey are gong to the ambulance yet they gave you the ... ...\n... you're listening to military radio I'm Christopher Kimball coming up next my interview with China garden we'll be right back\n\nSupport for Christopher criminals no street comes from regal where makers of Nineteen Nineteen cookware cooking happens in the kitchen but life happens around the kitchen table American Made stainless and non stick cookware learn more at Nineteen Nineteen ... dot com [noise] [noise]\nPopular current affairs program one hey is coming to New Hampshire next week host Joshua Johnson will moderate a special panel event don't miss your chance to see Johnson in person as well as an HP ours Peter below do appear together at the Capitol Center for the arts in Concord on October Eighteenth get your tickets now at C.

com thanks for joining us tonight for milk street radio you're listening to New Hampshire public radio [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball over the last twenty five years on a garden has gone from White House budget analysts cater and small store owner to being one of the most loved and recognize home cooks in America in her latest book cook like a pro honor focuses on how to cook not just what to cook\nToday we chatted about how she turned a small gourmet shop into a huge success and eventually a career in television I Know how are you\n[noise] I'm fine how are you Chris oh it's been a while it has since we last spoke up so everyone I think knows your story and we've talked about it but you worked in the White House or as\nA budget analyst on a nuclear energy budget and policy papers seems like another lifetime ago see I was like to have to go but you know here's my question you you see this ad for this ... square foot specialty store out west Hampton\nBeach ah Long Island and you said well you know maybe I should do some of your life [laughter] and then all of a sudden you moved out there [noise]\nWhat what was that you were really bad at because going from a policy analyst who are retailer is so different what were you really bad at and what were you really good at a in that or at the beginning you know beginning\nI think I I did everything you know when when you have a store and you have to employees you do everything so you bake bread and new make cakes and new um [noise] I mean you're everywhere and I think it was bad at following through because I start something and then start something else\nAnd I remember going home one day and I forgot that I had like thirty Kara cakes in the oven I came back to the next day [laughter] it was a disaster [laughter]\nUm I think when you when you have a situation like that and you don't know anything about it you just jump right in and you just do everything and I think I was probably bad at a managing my life because I was there like twenty hours a day I go home sleep really fast and come back again but I loved it so it didn't feel like it was\nWork it felt like it was it was like a huge sandbox and I just had so many fun things to do\nSo was it hard translating you're cooking from home cooking to retail cooking when you're making thirty Kara cakes that requires a totally different mindset in terms of prep and how how you organize yourself from the kitchen did that take time\nUm it took time to actually scale things up what I did was I when I bought this store it actually came with a notebook of recipes that the woman who had been running it for for me so she made pies and she made some things in quantities\nBut I kind of wanted to ramp it up and make it a little ... and what I learned really fast is that people didn't want fancy food they wanted good home cooking and so I remember making things like a you know some ... there was a Swedish dish called ... temptation I have no idea what it is now it's like potatoes and\nAnd and herring or something [laughter] and I remember I nobody bought it of course and I thought well we'll just have it for staff lunch and the staff didn't even know [laughter] so wrong that what I learned I learned what I mean actually really good example of it is I remember\nI'm doing I thought well I'll just make roast chicken but I I wanted to put it out in a really nice way so I had a big platter and fresh herbs on the bottom and I have roast chickens on it and nobody bought any and I thought ... ... ... what's wrong with this everybody wants to restrict\nAnd so I took the whole plot or back into the kitchen I took the chickens ever put them in this little red and white paper cups that you have for French fries and I'd line them up on the counter and they were gone and five minutes\nAnd so I thought what was interesting about what I was doing is that it was I Would do things all the time and I'd watch what what if people like what did they not like where did they want to buy parmesan cheese I Would put parmesan cheese all over the store and I got oh that's really interesting they want to buy it at the register on the way out\nSo so how how much of retailing is impulse is fifty percent of it impulse born\nWhile I think a lot of it is I think a lot of his ... as being smart and people would come in and say oh I just came in for a baguette and they walked out with you know fifty dollars worth of groceries so I think it's about visuals I think it's as if\nThey're things smell good they taste good it's fun being in the store it was always important to me I Would walk out of the store and I walked back in and say okay what do I hear what do I smell what do I see well what's interesting and um we had samples out so you can taste things which Frank Sinatra cranked up on the\nCD player and a and it was just fun being there I I Love when people would just say oh I'll just make you a Barefoot Contessa\nAnd while they were there that you know they get coffee and a muffin or something like that\nSo uh the name Barefoot Contessa was the name of the store when you bought it is that where it was and now as\nI looked up the movie because I I doubt it wherever gardeners actually dark movie well that's what I was going to say to you I mean as you know it ends in a multiple murder\nAnd able to just shot so the Barefoot Contessa dies at the end of the movie I thought that was so interesting that barefoot contested and most people has a somewhat happier [laughter] somewhat\nI think it's the image of being elegant an earthy and actually when I bought the store I thought the first thing I'm going to do is change the name because it doesn't say what it is has nothing to do with food doesn't say who it is it doesn't have somebody's name it was just an idea\nBut as I started but I didn't want to do it right off the bat because it was known and I thought well maybe over time I would change it but I realized what it is the idea that it's really about being elegant an earthy\nAnd that's what I think have a garden and was and that's what the for the movie was about and in a funny way that really kind of captured what I think the store is\nYour your your brand is interesting you are um you know you're my generation ah yet you really have I don't know of cult status was right but you have a very strong following large front and you can fill a two thousand seat theater for example as you well know [noise]\nUm so ... and you're doing it from a brand that is about comfort or and making people feel good about their home in the ... and could you just talk about that because it's so antithetical to what you see today you know with social media sort of the opposite of what most people are trying to so I I\nOkay so that it makes me so angry that I Want your life\nI think in my life I Do oh maybe I should look more in words [laughter]\nWhy are there have there been an artist thank you it's been a widow and and uh I Will be happy to wash dishes [laughter] and they tell you to come for dinner I'll wash the dishes deal either thanks so much that much but\nThat was on a garden and her new book is called cook like a pro\nMagician obscures the truth will be losing for the benefit of the audience the trick itself is usually more Jane

chicken Flint are real great Chris you know I interviewed Nigella Lawson recently on the show and she mentioned a term in her new book called ... which obviously is that he was term and I asked her what it was and it was chicken or chicken parts\nAnd you bake all this stuff with it and she was all happens once so I like the ... him and I liked the idea we brought it back to the kitchen but we thought we'd take that concept and adapted to something else so we have chickens we have a trade now what are we going to\nDo so we have bone in skin on chicken parts here you can mix that up you can ... dies from sex whatever combination you want here\nThink on a ... with us spice Rob\nAnd this particular one has coriander ginger salt and pepper and sugar it's faith in the oven\nFor about forty minutes at four fifty and that allowed us to get the crispy skin we wanted it also created um find on our pan which was another opportunity to make some flavor and add something different to this very simple baked chicken recipe whether you're just teasing me\nI Won a special thing we're going to do so we're going to make\nThe sauce right on the sheet track initially we just ... the pan and use that finds kind of make a quick sauce with lemon juice and vast\nBut what we found was we could add something else onto the tray and so we added ten garlic close actually onto the tray it goes in the other with the chicken so that roasted in the oven gets really nice and sweet and camel lights and soft you just smashed\nSupport for an HP arts live stream comes from you our listeners and from

C. G. E.\nHis book on food and cooking I think it was originally written in the Nineteen seventies\nIt's a very very dry read very dry you seriously like to read about science that's a good book for you but for a lot of us it's a hard it's a hard slog\nWell if you want the molecular answer but it's hard core yes so those are just a few you might want to thank you very much yeah my pleasure welcome to milk street who's calling\nYes Hi my name is rose\nHow ... what is your question today\nMy question is regarding duck breast\nI'm a fan of eating duck and it's always served pretty rare medium rare and I've always wondered why it's okay to duck and rare meeting him rare state whereas should not\nOther poultry chicken and turkey that way like what is the difference so why is it okay for the duck\nAnd we've had this question before an it's an excellent question first of all if you cooked duck breast to one sixty or sixty five you would have to throw it out they just do for a tough\nBattle nodding off that's what the government wants you to do I think the answer your question is that the poultry industry is obviously a huge industry people eat very little talk\nI think you're dealing with very different conditions on the farm and so the incidence of contamination in duck is very very well much lower than poultry it's fairly high\nChicken and turkey to something like eighty five percent yes very high Consumer Reports\nYeah so so ... is a small farms and they're not raised and also they're slaughtered\nA different way there and there's not as much possibility for cross contamination with ducks when they're slaughtered so I think that's why but you know you make choices yes yes people tell you not even to eat steak rarer they'll certainly not hamburger which is a different matter because it's ground up\nI Would say like general and I'm not nervous about anything but I Am a little nervous about poetry I actually by small producers organic I tell you where are you is there no there there's a campaign black during salmonella in organic chickens too\nWell I Know that I'm just thinking that maybe the incidents would be better in a\nLoan might prevent might it might but for some reason duck is is safer\nAlthough I'm sure the USDA would say we're wrong\nI only eat duck medium rare and I love it and by the way it's so good for you it's got more iron and a lot of red meat and that fat that it gives off it has a lot of the same properties is olive oil so it's a good thing to be eating\nBut again as eating and I'm always wondering why this is okay so I'm Glad I got my question answered\nWell I don't think that you would be happy about it [laughter] and we say it's okay yes we do row thank you so much yes free shipping all", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city": "Keene", "day": "11"}
