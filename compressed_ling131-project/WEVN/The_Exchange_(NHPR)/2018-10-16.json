will question the Republican and democratic candidates for Congress Republican state representative evening Ron and democratic incumbent congresswoman Ann mclane Kuster [noise]\nCandidates will have sixty seconds to answer each question often there'll be a follow up question or point of clarification from Casey army which will receive thirty seconds and we'd like to begin with opening statements a chance for candidates to make their case to voters will go in alphabetical order so congressman Custer welcome and go ahead please\nWell thank you Laura it's wonderful to be here I Want to thank an H PR for this great civic opportunity I Want to thank my a colleague opponents or Mr net ground for accepting our\nCommitment to civility and I think we'll have an interesting discussion today when I went to Congress I promised a new approach and that was bringing people together to get things done\nUh I think that is the New Hampshire way to vary a bipartisan district and I've tried to work in a bipartisan way bringing people together a hundred and five members of Congress to work on that task force that I created on the opioid epidemic\nUm I've worked across the lines on the Veterans' Affairs committee and on the farm bill in the Agriculture Committee and recently with a brand new taskforce on Republicans and Democrats working together to and sexual violence so I'll look forward to the discussion and thanks for having us\nWell and thank you and represented ... go ahead thank you also for being here actually with that you learned Casey for being here if everybody that's in the audience or\nAn honor and privilege to show that stayed with congresswoman Custer you know this is a as probably the most significant election we've had in our lifetime\nOr that's coming up here and it's very important that that we take the situations that we've seen over the last six years with comes from a customer and what we're seeing today in Washington\nI'm that it is an important time for us to make a decision as to what we want to move this country forward you know I bring a different perspective I Am Hispanic\nArmy veteran I'm a small business owner of a community leader and I think those are the kind of voices that we need a here in Washington and I think it's important that we have a a an opportunity to hear both sides keep an open mind that's out there because it's up to that is going to decide and so I'm really excited about being here and if I may say something in Spanish I adore the hint tickets on a good time and we went up there\nThat I see is All right thank you and let's get into our questions the order of questioning was decided by an earlier ... so representative and Iran you won that coin toss so you'll go first and good thing [laughter] I let you decide [laughter]\nI Want to start off with some international affairs as you both know a bipartisan chorus of lawmakers is calling for possible sanctions including arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nAfter the mysterious disappearance and presumed murder of us based Saudi journalist Jamal ... if you were in Congress representing ... would you be joining this group calling for possible sanctions\nWell the first thing I think there are two words that you use reporting is presumed impossible I mean you know we are we're a country that that has due process and we need to make sure that we follow that regardless whether it's\nOn within our the borders of our country or or a abroad and so that if there are some things that are out there that um that we should be looking into I'm all for that absolutely what I wouldn't do is do what we did during the Kavanaugh hearings and rush to judgment\nUm you know we have an opportunity here to to listen uh we do know that the Saudis are allies but if during the course of due process we find that there are situations that merit us\nI'm putting sanctions against any entity that I think that's what we should do but we shouldn't rush to judgment you know we shouldn't have this um pack mentality that we saw during the Kavanaugh hearings that all of us and we want to rush to judgment and convict something or someone um but if in fact there is something out there that's a legitimate issues and I would absolutely go ahead and support that\nCongresswoman Custer where do you stand on this issue of possible sanctions against\nSaudi Arabia well the first amendment and the protection of journalists around the globe is one of the most important values that we hold\nAnd I think particularly given the last two years that the Trump Administration journalism is really risen to the task of\nKeeping people honest and it's a big challenge with this president he's already gone out and talked about rogue\nGroups that may have harmed uh this journalist and I think what we're hearing is that the Saudis are about to come forward and recognize and tell the world that he was murdered in fact murdered and dissent dismembered\nDuring an interrogation in this Saudi under CNN stumble I think it's outrageous and I think Congress should act and I think we should have sanction\nOn a pivot to an issue that I Know you were hearing a lot about from constituents here in New Hampshire and that's about the economy and\nRepresented in the ground the number one complaint that we hear from New Hampshire businesses is workforce just yesterday I talked to a tourism official who said some hospitality businesses in her region want it to stay open until Columbus Day had to close on Labor Day because of a lack of employees wow that's a lot of loft opportunity there\nWhat congressional role do you see if any in bolstering New Hampshire's workforce\nYou know we we here in New Hampshire has one of the lowest unemployment but I myself and I've been talking to small businesses and and being a small business owner myself we hear that there is an issue out there were bringing in some seasonal workers to do those things are ... you're talking about our visa program needs to absolutely be re looked at an event\nYou know there are situations we are actually hindering small businesses from doing the stuff I talked to an individual\nFranchises and what he has had to do is actually close I'm\nIn a and put them altogether and wants to be has enough workforce to do that so you know when you look at the top of people that want to come in here and we have a process to do that we need to look at how do we help the small businesses and New Hampshire but the only way we do that has been going out there and listening to them knocking on doors sitting down having a cup of coffee and seeing how the government can help them by allowing the right type of people to come in to help them with their business\nSo you mentioned the visas and as you know many New Hampshire businesses especially in hospitality are calling for a higher level of age to be very says these are allowed to temporary work at it as you mentioned so if you were elected to Congress I'm represented Ron would you support increasing the number of age to be says\nAbsolutely see what happened was [noise] it was up I think the number was thirty thousand\nAnd I'm ... prior you know thirty thousand if you had people that were there than there were\nAutomatically um entered into to have an age to be these are the problem became is that this year it it all started from zero the reason why visas are so important to why I'm a proponent of it is that it's a national security issue for me when you come into this country\nI Need to know who you are where you're saying what your direction and what purpose so I'm not talking about just an open border kind of thing that other people want to talk about it is um calculated it's collected and you know and if I Know where somebody is already there what do you keep on doing that as well\nSo the age to be program you feel satisfies those security requirements just meant\nA different economic question for you congresswoman Custer as you know the unemployment rate in the U.S has now with its lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine I'm three point seven percent nationally even lower here in New Hampshire there's an old saying that Americans often vote with their wallets in mind so if that's the case shouldn't they vote Republican\nThis year absolutely not and I'm very surprised actually by Mr ... answer because I would've have comprehensive immigration reform that passed the Senate five and a half years ago Kelly Ayotte voted for John McCain a\nA ... a two thirds of the Senate and yet the house of representatives under Republican leadership has not held a single hearing\nAnd in fact they're cutting back on visas what we need is to expand the age to be program absolutely for seasonal workers we need farm workers I was on a dairy farm just the other day where they can't get the workers that they need\nAnd we need to expand opportunity for legal immigration and yet the Republicans flat out refused to do that and it's harming our economy right here in New Hampshire we've got the second lowest unemployment in the country\nAnd we need to make sure that people have the opportunity and businesses have the workers that they need well\nTo the unemployment rate though my question is if a Republicans are going to run for Congress this year saying look at the unemployment rate look at all the good things that are happening economy wages are rising lowest unemployment rate since Nineteen sixty nine how can Democrats make the case yeah yeah that's fine but we'll do even better\nBecause we will do better we will do job training that's what we need in the workforce and all of these cuts by the Trump administration's either positions that Mr ... takes to cut back the government\nThey get in the way of education just look at that see device in the department of education and the privatization what we need to do is invest in people and what I've been doing is visiting our career in technical high school is our community colleges\nBringing in federal money the grants that we brought to National Community college for advanced manufacturing\nAnd for micro electronic program so that people get the training so that they can get better wages have a better life\nOn the immigration question kissing McDermott has a question the immigration so I'll set that aside for now but Mr underground what about the cuts that the um top administration has proposed to educational programs such as community colleges and so forth will those hurt workforce development what I think when you look at\nMass General revolutionizing care [noise] am from Ralph young and picking the tally with law offices in Concord Nashua Boston and now in Montpelier national impacts uniquely New Hampshire Ralph law dot com\nSunny and windy for today and we'll have high temperatures upper forties to mid fifties\nWelcome back to our candidate for my New Hampshire's second congressional district I'm Laura ... along with Casey McDermott and this hour we're talking with the Republican and democratic nominees\nState Representative Steve Nick ... an incumbent congresswoman\nAnn mclane Custer and just before the break we were talking about the opioid crisis and representative and Iran I did want to give you another thirty seconds or so to respond to my question about why you didn't support Medicaid expansion when many people including Republicans say this has been a critical tool for combating addiction here in the state\nSure it was I going to rise I said earlier you know when we looked at the totality of that bill it was just a tax\n'em there will be looked at it you know we understand an all Republicans in the\nIn the current state house understand that this was an issue that when he attacked but I think we need to be doing more I think you know when you look at how treatment is and we're trying treating opioid addiction with an opioid just doesn't pass the Senate a check for me so when you look at van spurts and what are you to hold the farmers accountable\nI wanted to bring them on task and make sure that they're doing what they need to do to try to provide if they're going to do obedience to do something that's not so ... you know dependent leading and I think that we have to be responsible for that perspective to do that\nBecause it sounds like you're not a fan of medication assisted treatment in what you just said\nI Am if in fact this comes to I Believe like Medicaid that comes on or any kind of money that's coming down to forty two million over the next two years but there has to be some rules of engagement of what we're using\nTreatment centers that none of that money is going to him you know so we need to make sure that if federal money is coming down that we have some sort of wherewithal to work with the state legislature and the governor and executive council to make sure it's going to those places are absolutely Juanita\nOkay congressman Custer thirty seconds to say well just to make the point that fifty two thousand people finally had health insurance coverage and could access\nA medication and treatment for opioid disorder and Mr underground voted no he's also opposed to the Affordable CARE Act that brings treatment and access\nIt people need mental health treatment as well for out of five heroin users have a co occurring mental health disorder and if you go to any treatment facility in the state they're going to say to you\nHaving access to coverage and health care is critically important and you can't solve this problem without it\nLet's move onto another topic and Casey McDermott back to plead congresswoman cost her according to ProPublica you've sponsored twenty five bills during this most recent term but just three of those have made it out of committee how can you assure voters that you will be ineffective representative F reelected\nWell the point is that I work in a bipartisan way and we've had dozens of bills passed into law by President Trump's so it's not having my name on it is not the most important thing the most important thing is working together\nThe Veterans' Affairs committee has been the most prolific committee we've got an eighty bills out twenty to sign into law by the president\nI was very proud to be one of two Democrats on the mission act to be a mission act to extend coverage particularly here in New Hampshire\nWorking with ... to make sure that New Hampshire citizens and veterans get access to treatment in the community and I attended the signing ceremony at the White House so that's what's important in getting the farm bill done in a bipartisan way\nUm and working on the opioid epidemic passing fifty four bills that came out of my task force in June that's now part of the comprehensive addiction and Recovery Act going to the president for his signature that's what's important is getting the job\nDone [noise] um and this is a follow up question from listener along those lines on what was your first piece of legislation that you submitted when you got to DC\nWell there were dozens of bills on there wasn't any one in particular it's working on my committees and working with my colleagues one of the bills that was a missed opportunity in the tax bill and had in mind that is a Republican leadership\nWe had a bill that would provide a tax incentive for small businesses and companies to provide training and job ... workforce development and that is something that will be the first bill that we introduced in January and the Democratic administration and we'll get it into law\nOr now anti representative ... according to records from the New Hampshire house you've not sponsored any bills during your term in the legislature can you explain life\nAbsolutely you know when you know just to put in legislation for legislation is like um isn't the right thing to do I think you need to sit back\nAnd find out you latch on to somebody who becomes um your mentor to figure out you know just because you don't submit legislation doesn't mean you don't actively work on bills promote bills um so it was really as as a really a foot soldier in my first term in the house\nUm I did a lot of work for both a democratic bills and Republican bill says that's why I did I just sit back and you know just to put something into so you did and it's really not a measure of of of success\nCan you give an example of one of those bills that you were a foot soldier for\nSure so there was so I was in the election law committee on which was a very um spirited I'm committed over the last two sessions and there were some votes on there they cannot tornado\nOn they were both bipartisan you know when it was also about I was also the whip 'em for the election law committed to my job my responsibility was to make sure that we got some people on board or to bring 'em over and so that's what it is right and I worked across ... both of those because we both had Democrats\nHow would you assure voters than that you'd be able to effectively advocate for policies on their behalf our sponsor policies on their behalf in Washington without that corresponding or experience at the state level\nShirts or whatever you is the first thing you have to do is that your the people that we represented the second grade school district and know that you're listening\nI'm there to come back here the Jew effectively go all the way up to cost counting you listen to what they have and you have\nTruly town hall meetings where you actually have the full chairs and and sit in Barnes and where it's cold in the winter in hot in the summer those are the kinds of things and that's when when they know fundamentally that you are listening and that you're taking that clear Chris New Hampshire water to Washington than they know that you're fighting on their behalf\nThank you both and Casey our next question also comes from you continuing on this political theme and we'll go back to your representative or let's talk about the political climate right now we've seen a wave of protests on the left recently a movement that some Republicans have characterized as an out of control mob\nHow are these protests that we're seeing from the resistance movement today different from the ones that we've seen from the right in the past such as the Tea Party and twenty ten\nSure well first of all I'm civil protest is a bedrock of our country um we've seen it but when we see in over the last couple of weeks really is just is I look I characterize it as violence it isn't protesting when you chase people into restaurants\nAnd you um get in their face you know there's a way to actually demonstrate and put a position forward but we saw during the Kavanaugh hearings right where people even before the hearing started were just there to be disruptive they weren't there to provide any sort of civility any kind of alter I'm kind of position\nAnd that's not what we're about that's not what this country is about and I don't care if you're a Democrat I don't care of your Republican and that's how you feel that you have to get your voice heard then you need to look at yourself and internally and figure out what your position that you want to put forward but we were embarrassed as a country\nWhen we looked at the Kavanaugh hearings and I've walked over twenty seven thousand doors and what I hear from people after the Capitol hearing was they were ashamed\nThere were a shame that that's the way that we have to go ahead and find good discourse so I Believe it's wrong I Believe I'm spirited discussion is good I think disagreement is good but the way that um the left covered up this way was almost embarrassing and I have friends that live all over the world and they kept asking me how did that happen and I didn't have an answer for them\nUm and just one more follow up for you or during the Republican primary you said that the scandal surrounding the Trump Administration has no bearing on your campaign and instead you and the voters of the second district are focused on policy issues\nAt the same time those scandals or the subject of ongoing congressional oversight if elected what overstate role if any do you believe Congress should play\nWell that's a little bit of you bring legitimate issues that people can actually put their their their duties into you can address it that way but over here was rhetoric and saber rattling right everybody wants to find something that doesn't exist out there and that's not the way to legislate you know if in fact there is a legitimate position and a legitimate charge that is founded\nWhich substantiated data I'm Dennis go ahead and follow the course of civil but lacking but just to be able to have a fire just because you want to have a fire I think it's disingenuous\nUm congresswoman Custer to you now are back during the twenty twelve campaign you were approached by a Republican staffer with a video camera who was trying to ask you a question you responded by grabbing the camera and can be heard using some coarse language\nGiven your personal experience being confronted by a political opponent what do you believe to be the appropriate balance between protest and civil engagement in the current era\nWell that was more attack um no I think the civil protest is what it's all about and\nThousands of women came forward who had been sexually assaulted gig because it was clear that the Senate committee or we're going to just rams through a candidate without hearing the charges and\nThese were serious allegations and the point is that a person going on a lifetime appointment to the United States Supreme court should her the highest degree of more\nAnd and should have the temperament and the demeanor so the people that I heard from were shocked by the way the Senate handled the hearing by how rude they were and they were very taken by Dr Palese Ford and her testimony because it rang true in their lives\nSo tens of thousands of people were protesting because they felt they weren't being heard\nAt UNH is hosting hall October Nineteen twenty registration cola dog UNH dot edu [noise]\nWelcome back to our Kennedy foreign with the Republican and democratic nominees for New Hampshire's second congressional district Republican state Representative Steve Negron an incumbent congresswoman and mclane Kuster I'm Laura ... along with an H parents casing McDermott and Casey next question is from your piece\nYou've defended your decision not to support a ban on conversion therapy for algae be teach you use\nBut a number of major medical organizations including the American Academy of pediatrics have denounced conversion therapy saying it can cause long term harm to children how do you square that perspective from medical experts with your vote against banning the practice\nRight you know just like any legislation you have to look at the building is ... and so when I voted against it when you looked at the reason I voted against it was that it took the right up uh parents\nA child and I think that's fundamentally wrong I think a parent has a responsibility whether or not with or without the medical community that's my child and I know what's best for my child and I should be able to have a decision process and that and that built took that right away from me as a parent and that's why I voted against it would you support\nA modified version of the bell taking into account some about expert perspective\nAbsolutely I think if you looked at a building you looked at what they were trying to do there were some things in there that absolutely should not be done clearly\nBut when it's all boils down to one and as a parent you know if there was an opportunity for us to really look at the bill and make it a better bill I Would absolutely entertainment but you know I get I get very defensive when somebody in the government tries to tell me as a parent what I can do with my child\nI'm next up to Congress someone Custer ah looking more broadly at your campaign finance records you've raised more than three million dollars toward your reelection campaign including about a third of that from PACs\nSome of your top contributors include major insurers financial forums other corporations um what do you state of voters who might question your ability to represent the interests of everyday citizens when so much of your money comes from these groups\nWell most of our money comes from individuals' here in New Hampshire and around the country and I'm definitely proud of that and the point is we need comprehensive immigration a comprehensive campaign finance and that's one of the first spills that Democrats will bring in in January if we win back the house in November\nAnd what's important about that is that the program that we have is transparent you can see that you can look at the records it doesn't impact my voting but these are expensive elections the Koch brothers than four million dollars against me in two thousand fourteen\nAnd I'm going to defend the people in this state against that outside money what is going on regulated is the dark money the millions of dollars that are being spent by Republicans corporations Koch brothers and others\nThat has no no transparency and no accountability whatsoever at all and so that's what we're going to do its cold we the people and it's a set of reforms that will reform our campaign finance and I very much look forward to that system\nAre you saying that there is no dark money on the Democratic side congressman not coming into New Hampshire no not coming into\nNew Hampshire so to address what Casey said um you know some Republicans and some Democrats said I'm a little concerned about all that big corporate money that the congresswoman is is getting I just I'm just wondering how you can reassure people to follow up on\nWhat you need to understand is those pack contributions are limited there five thousand dollars in the primary in the general and they're from individuals there from employees so I'm proud to have the support let me use the example of fidelity that has five thousand employees here in my district\nAnd that those people have come forward and pooled their resources and that they support my reelection I'm proud of that I don't have any problem with\nThat I'd like to turn to the issue of guns gun violence gun control this has been a big issue during this election season and a congressman Custer to you first in February you called for quote meaningful commonsense solutions\nAfter the Parkland school shootings you said the right approach protects both school children and the rights of responsible gun owners can you give us one example of an approach that achieves both those objectives protecting the rights of responsible gun owners but also protecting our kids\nSure and there are many examples by the way look I've talked to gun owners I've talked to a teacher's I've talked to people in the community we have an epidemic of violence that we need to control\nAnd one way to do that is to fortify our schools but a much more important way to do that is to provide mental health treatment and to limit the risk from these high capacity guns that are really threatening people I had a great suggests than the other day right after our forum from\nHe's a responsible gun owner he belongs to a gun club and he said why don't we use those\nUh weapons that we might enjoy in the gun club and so that they are locked and they are cared for and I think that's what we want to work with gun owners that are responsible on keeping these weapons safe but right now we've got a real epidemic of violence that threatens people not just in schools that's heartbreaking\nBut in movie theaters in churches in night clubs and we've got to address this level of violence around the country\nOnce you start saying let's ban this type of gun or that type of gun you mentioned high capacity magazines and on talking about\nBanning by the way what he was talking about is having them locked\nIn the gun club and so that people can use them because I've met many people in New Hampshire who enjoy that as a sport as a form of recreation\nUm this is what they enjoy and by the way I ... certainly support the second amendment for\nProtecting your children in your home and for um hunting and this is a long history in New Hampshire so you're not saying ban certain types of weapons like high capacity magazines I what I'm Talking about is let's find a middle ground I think this whole issue has been far too polarized\nAnd we haven't had a middle ground we hadn't had solutions\nThat are widely acceptable what we do know is that most gun owners\nHave as much concern about these school shootings as any other citizen and let's try to meet them halfway find a way that they feel comfortable but things like background checks that's not going to be a problem for responsible gun owners and New Hampshire we can improve upon that the no fly no by if you're a\nA a terrorist you can't fly on an airplane you shouldn't be able to walk into a gun store and I know the Republican talking points love to talk about him is Thirteen I don't think an MS Thirteen terrorists should be able to walk into a gun store and buy a gun so no fly no by as another example\nWell let's talk about background checks into you representative ... please federal law requires licensed firearms dealers to perform background checks on ... perspective purchasers but doesn't require unlicensed sellers to do so although some states do require these unlicensed sellers to conduct background checks\nShould all gun sales are no matter who is selling be subject to background checks\nOr you look at the current laws or we have a two and I just want to make a comment you know when when these these um unfortunate circumstances having like Parkland\nUm you know they want to throw 'em the majority of us as gun owners are are just that the majority is just as these few that have in my mind I think there's some mental issues that have to be addressed and we and we actually look at the instruments and then you throw the whole situation at the feet of the the majority instead of throwing a defeat where it belongs and that's where that shooter\nUm and and we need to do better at that we need to understand what the situation what drove that individual to take that action that I was only recourse so when you start figuring out you know what it is as a as a law abiding citizen a law abiding gun owner we had the laws on the books that I think nothing has to change I I mean I'm a proponent of a national reciprocity long\nBut you know what we have to put the blame 'em and the responsibility at the feet of the individuals and those are those people that are perpetrating these or if a guy\nIf that individual who wants to perpetrate an act um did want to purchase a gun from a friend from a gun show a he or she wouldn't have to go through a background check 'em should he or she have to go through a background check no matter where he or she gets\nWell you have to look at the law today but if we're going to focus on the engineering there are specific situation where individual are not allowed to purchase a weapon on those are the laws that we have in the book today and that's why we call we're so's law abiding citizens law abiding gun owners so somebody up there that's going to a break the law by purchasing a weapon when he or she\nSupport for an HP ours live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustain excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England legal challenges\nFind out how or in Reno can help you on line at or dash Reno dot com absolutely\nBut there's other instances where you wouldn't have to depending on the seller so should all gun sales be subject to background checks no matter who is the seller\nA no no I don't think that's\nAnother question about background checks when a licensed dealer as you know I'm as a gun owner request a background check the FBI has to complete it in three days if that process for some reason takes the FBI longer the person is able to purchase the gun control advocates have called this the Charleston loophole because it allowed Dylann Roof to buy\nThe gun he used to kill nine churchgoers in South Carolina\nShould the FBI represent underground have more time to conduct such background checks\nW ... eighty eight point three W.

receive thirty seconds and we'd like to begin with opening statements a chance for candidates to make their case to voters will go an alphabet Ikle order so congressman Custer welcome and go ahead please\nWell thank you Laura it's wonderful to be here I Want to thank an H PR for this great civic opportunity I Want to thank my a colleague opponents of Mr ... for accepting our\nCommitment to civility and I think we'll have an interesting discussion today when I went to Congress I promised a new approach and that was bringing people together to get things done\nUh I think that is the New Hampshire way to vary a bipartisan district and I've tried to work in a bipartisan way bringing people together a hundred and five members of Congress to work on that task force that I created on the opioid epidemic\nUm I've worked across the lines on the Veterans' Affairs committee and on the farm bill in the Agriculture Committee and recently with a brand new taskforce on Republicans and Democrats working together to and sexual violence so I'll look forward to the discussion and thanks for having us\nWell and thank you and represented ... go ahead thank you also for being here\nAbsolutely with that you learned Casey for being here if everybody that's in the audience it's a pleasure to be here and again it's an honor and a privilege to show the stayed with congressman Custer you know this is a as probably the most significant election we've had in our lifetime\nOr that's coming up here and it's very important that we take the situations that we've seen over the last six years on wood comes from a customer and what we're seeing today in Washington\nI'm that it is an important time for us to make a decision as to where we want to move this country forward you know I bring a different perspective I Am Hispanic\nArmy veteran I'm a small business owner of a community leader and I think those are the kind of voices that we need a here in Washington and I think it's important that we have a a an opportunity to hear both sides keep an open mind that's out there because it's up to ... going to decide\nAnd so really excited about being here you know if I may say something in Spanish I thought of a hint ticket ... joined them we want to be a good idea\nLet's get into our questions the order of questioning was decided by an earlier coin toss so representative and Iran\nYou won that coin toss so you'll go first and good thing [laughter] I let you decide [laughter] I Want to start off with some international affairs as you both know a bipartisan chorus of lawmakers is calling for possible sanctions including arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nAfter the mysterious disappearance and presumed murder of us based Saudi journalist Jamal 'cause she'll be gee if you were in Congress representing ... would you be joining this group calling for possible sanctions\nWell the first thing I think there are two words that use reporting is presumed impossible I mean you know we are we're a country that that has due process and we need to make sure that we follow that regardless whether it's\nUm within the borders of our country or or a abroad and so that if there are some things that are out there that um that we should be looking into I'm all for that absolutely what I wouldn't do is do what we did during the Kavanaugh hearings and rush to judgment\nUm you know we have an opportunity here to to listen or we do know what the Saudis are allies but if during the course of due process we find that there are situations that merit us\nI'm putting sanctions against any entity that I think that's what we should do but we shouldn't rush to judgment you know we shouldn't have this um pack mentality that we saw during the cabin out here is that all of a sudden we want to rush to judgment a convict something or someone um but if in fact there is something out there that's a legitimate issues and I would absolutely go ahead and support that\nCongresswoman Custer where do you stand on this issue of possible sanctions against Saudi Arabia\nWell the first amendment and the protection of journalists around the globe is one of the most important values that we hold\nAnd I think particularly given the last two years that the Trump Administration journalism is really risen to the task of keeping people honest and it's a big challenge with this president he's already gone out and talked about rogue\nGroups that may have harmed ah this journalist and I think what we're hearing is that the Saudis are about to come forward and recognize and tell the world that he was murdered in fact murdered and dissent dismembered\nDuring an interrogation in this Saudi embassy in Istanbul I think it's outrageous and I think Congress should act and I think we should have sanction\nOn a pivot to an issue that I Know you were hearing a lot about from constituents here in New Hampshire and that's about the economy and\nRepresented in the ground the number one complaint that we hear from New Hampshire businesses is workforce just yesterday I talked to a tourism official who said some hospitality businesses in her region want it to stay open until Columbus Day had to close on Labor Day because of a lack of employees wow that's a lot of last opportunity there\nWhat congressional role do you see if any in ... New Hampshire's workforce\nAbsolutely you know we we hear the New Hampshire has one of the lowest unemployment but I myself when I've been talking to small businesses and and being a small business owner myself\nWe hear that there is a a new show up there with bringing in some seasonal workers to do those things that you're you're talking about our visa program needs to absolutely we re looked at an event you know there are situations we are actually hindering small businesses from doing the stuff I talked to an individual that owns a significant amount of Dunkin' Donuts\nFranchises and what he has had to do is actually close I'm\nIn a and put them altogether and wants to be has enough workforce to do that so you know when you look at the top of people that want to come in here and we have a process to do that we need to look at how do we help the small businesses in New Hampshire but the only way we do that has been going out there and listening to them knocking on doors sitting down having a cup of coffee and seeing how the government can help them by allowing the right type of people to come in to help them with their business\nSo you mentioned the visas and as you know many New Hampshire businesses especially and hospitality are calling for a higher level\nAge to be like this these or allow the temporary work at it as you mentioned so if you were elected to Congress I'm representing the ground would you support increasing the number of age to BP's as\nSee what happened was [noise] it was up\nI'm ... prior you know thirty thousand if you have people that were there than there were\nAutomatically um entered into to have an age to be ... the problem became is that this year it it all started from zero the reason why visas are so important who I Am a proponent of it is that it's a national security issue for me when you come into this country\nI Need to know who you are where you're saying what you're duration and what purpose so I'm not talking about just an open border kind of thing that other people want to talk about it is um calculated it's collected and you know and if I Know where somebody is already then what do you keep on doing that as well\nSo the age to be program you feel satisfies those security requirement just meant\nA different economic question for you congresswoman Custer as you know the unemployment rate in the U.S is now with its lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine I'm three point seven percent nationally even lower here in New Hampshire there's an old saying that Americans often vote with their wallets in mind so if that's the case shouldn't they vote Republican this year\nAbsolutely not and I'm very surprised actually by Mr ... answer because I would've have comprehensive immigration reform that passed the Senate five and a half years ago Kelly Ayotte voted for John McCain at\nA ... a two thirds of the Senate and yet the house of representatives under Republican leadership\nHas not held a single hearing and in fact they're cutting back on visas what we need is to expand the age to be program absolutely for seasonal workers we need to fire workers I was on a dairy farm just the other day where they can't get the workers that they need\nAnd we need to expand opportunity for legal immigration and yet the Republicans flat out refused to do that and it's harming our economy right here in New Hampshire we've got the second lowest unemployment in the country and we need to make sure that people have the opportunity and the businesses have the workers that they need\nWell to the unemployment rate though my question is if a Republicans are going to run for Congress this year saying look at the unemployment rate look at all the good things that are happening economy wages are rising lowest unemployment rate since Nineteen sixty nine how can Democrats make the case yeah yeah that's fine but we'll do even better\nBecause we will do that or we will do job training that's what we need in the workforce and all of these cuts by the Trump Administration by the positions that Mr ... takes to cut back the government\nThey get in the way of education just look at that the ... and the department of education and the privatization what we need to do is invest in people and what I've been doing is visiting our career in technical high school is our community colleges\nBringing in federal money the grants that we brought to National Community college for advanced manufacturing\nAnd for micro electronic programs so that people get the training so that they can get better wages have a better life\nOn the immigration question kissing McDermott has a question the immigration so I'll set that aside for now but Mr underground what about the cuts that the Trump Administration has proposed to educational programs such as community colleges and so forth will those hurt workforce development\nAnd from Dartmouth Hitchcock rated number one hospital in New Hampshire by US News World Report driving to get patients backlogs important moments Dartmouth Hitchcock Godard or\nThis is an HBO\nBack to our Kennedy form a New Hampshire's second congressional district I'm Laura ... along with Casey McDermott and this hour we're talking with the Republican and democratic nominees state Representative Steve Negron an incumbent congresswoman\nAnn mclane Custer and just before the break we were talking about the opioid crisis and representative ... I did want to give you another thirty seconds or so to respond to my question about why you didn't support Medicaid expansion when many people including Republicans say this has been a critical tool for combating addiction here in the state\nSure it was I going to rise I said earlier you know when we looked at the totality of that bill it was just a tax\n'em there will be looked at it you know we understand an all Republicans in the in the current state house understand that this is an issue that when you attack but I think we need to be doing more I think you know when you look at how treatment is and we're trying treating opioid addiction with an opioid just doesn't pass the Senate he checked for me so when you look advancements and we need to hold the farmers accountable\nI wanted to bring them on task and make sure that they're doing what they need to do to try to provide if they're going to do ... to do something that's not so ... you know dependent leading and I think that we have to be responsible from that perspective to do that\nBecause it sounds like you're not a fan of medication assisted treatment in what you just said\nWell I Am if in fact this comes to I Believe like Medicaid that comes on or any kind of money that's coming down to forty two million of the next two years but there has to be some rules of engagement of what we're using it you know what I was talking to somebody west seven treatment centers that none of that money is going to him\nYou know so we didn't make sure that if federal money is coming down that we have some sort of where we thought to work with the state legislature and the governor and executive council to make sure it's going to those places are absolutely Juanita\nOkay congressman Custer thirty seconds to say well just to make the point that fifty two thousand people finally had health insurance coverage and could access\nA medication and treatment for opioid disorder and missed underground voted no he's also opposed to the Affordable CARE Act that brings treatment and access\nIt people need mental health treatment as well for out of five heroin users Heather Cole occurring mental health disorder and if you go to any treatment facility in the state they're going to say to you having access\nIt's critically important and\nYou can't solve this problem without it let's move on to another topic and Casey McDermott back to plead\nCongresswoman Custer according to the public eye you've sponsored twenty five bills during this most recent term but just three of those have made it out of committee how can you assure voters that you will be ineffective representative\n... well the point is that I work in a bipartisan way and we've had dozens of bills passed into law by President Trump's so it's not\nHaving my name on it is not the most important thing in the most important thing is working together the Veterans' Affairs committee has been the most prolific committee we've gotten eighty bills out twenty two signed into law by the president\nI was very proud to be one of two Democrats on the mission activity a mission act to extend coverage particularly here in New Hampshire\nWorking with ... to make sure that New Hampshire citizens and veterans get access to treatment in the community and I attended the a signing ceremony at the White House so that's what's important getting the farm bill done in a bipartisan way\nUm and working on the opioid epidemic passing fifty four bills that came out of my task force in June that's now part of the comprehensive addiction and Recovery Act going to the president for his signature that's what's important is getting the job done\n[noise] um and this is a follow up question from listener along those lines um what was your first piece of legislation that you've submitted when you've got to DC\nWell there were dozens of bills on there wasn't any one in particular it's working on my committees and working with my colleagues one of the bills that was a missed opportunity in the tax bill and had in mind that is a Republican leadership\nWe had a bill that would provide a tax incentive for small businesses and companies to provide training and job ... workforce development and that is something that will be the first bill that we introduced in January and the Democratic administration and we'll get it into law\nA now anti representative Negron according to records from the New Hampshire house you've not sponsored any bills during your term in the legislature can you explain life\nAbsolutely you know when you know just to put a legislation for legislation is like um isn't the right thing to do I think you need to sit back\nAnd find out you lash up to somebody who becomes um your mentor to figure out you know just because you don't submit legislation doesn't mean you don't actively worked on bills promote bills um so it was really as as a really a foot soldier in my first term in the house\nUm I did a lot of work for both a democratic bills and Republican bill says that's why I did I just sit back and you know just to put something into so you did is really not a measure of of of success\nCan you give an example of one of those bills that you were a foot soldier for\nSure so there was so I was in the election law committee which was a very um spirited I'm committed over the last two sessions\nAnd there was some votes on there though cannot tornado on both bipartisan you know and it was also about I was also the whip 'em for the election law can be just in my job my responsibility was to make sure that we the guts of people on board or to bring them over and so that's what is right and I worked across ALS for both of those 'cause we both had democratic and Republican Senate committee\n[noise] um and how would you assure voters than that you'd be able to effectively advocate for policies on their behalf our sponsor policies on their behalf in Washington without that corresponding or experience at the state level\nSure what I Do is the first thing you have to do is that your the people that we represented the ... congressional district know that you're listening\nI'm there to come back here the Jew effectively go all the way up to cost counting you listen to what they have and you have truly town hall meetings where you actually have the full chairs and and sit in Barnes and where it's cold in the winter and hot in the summer\nThose are the kinds of things and that's when when they know fundamentally that you are listening and that you're taking that clear Chris New Hampshire water to Washington than they know that you're fighting on their behalf\nThank you both and Casey our next question also comes from you continuing on this political themes and we'll go back to you\nClimate right now we've seen a wave of protests on the left recently movement that some Republicans have characterized as an out of control mob how are these protests that we're seeing from the resistance movement today different from the ones that we've seen from the right in the past such as the Tea Party and twenty ten\nSure well first of all I'm civil protest is a bedrock of our country um we've seen it but when we see in over the last couple of weeks really is just is I look I characterize it as violence that isn't protesting when you chase people into restaurants\nAnd you um get in their face you know there's a way to actually demonstrate and put a position forward but when we saw during the Kavanaugh hearings right where people even before the hearing started were just there to be disruptive they weren't there to provide any sort of civility any kind of alter I'm kind of position\nAnd that's not what we're about that's not what this country is about and I don't care if you're a Democrat on a pair of your Republican and that's how you feel that you have to get your voice her then you need to look at yourself and internally and figure out what your position that you want to put forward but we were embarrassed as a country\nWhen we looked at the Kavanaugh hearings and I've walked over twenty seven thousand doors and what I hear from people after the Capitol hearing was they were ashamed\nThere were a shame but that's the way that we have to go ahead and find good discourse so I Believe it's wrong I Believe I'm spirited discussion is good I think disagreement is good but the way that um the left covered up this way was almost embarrassing and I have friends that live all over the world and they kept asking me how did that happen and I didn't have an answer for them\nUm and just one more follow up for you or during the Republican primary you said that the scandal surrounding the Trump Administration has no bearing on your campaign and instead you and the voters of the second district are focused on policy issues\nAt the same time those scandals or the subject of ongoing congressional oversight if elected what overstate role if any do you believe Congress should play\nWell that's a little bit of you bring legitimate issues that people can actually put their their their duties into you can address it that way but over here was rhetoric and saber rattling right everybody wants to find something that doesn't exist out there and that's not the way to legislate you know if in fact there is a legitimate position and a legitimate charge that is founded\nWhich substantiated data I'm Dennis go ahead and follow the course of civil but lacking but just to be able to have a fire just because you want to have a fire I think it's disingenuous\nUm congresswoman Custer to you now are back during the twenty twelve campaign you were approached by a Republican staffer with a video camera who was trying to ask you a question you responded by grabbing the camera and can be heard using some coarse language\nGiven your personal experience being confronted by a political opponent what do you believe to be the appropriate balance between protest and civil engagement in the current era\nWell that was more attack um no I think the civil protest is what it's all about and thousands of women came forward who had been sexually assaulted because it was clear that the Senate committee or what's going to just rams through a candidate without hearing the charges and\nThese were serious allegations and the point is that a person going on a lifetime appointment to the United States Supreme court should her the highest degree of moral or fortitude and and should have the temperament and the demeanor\nSo the people that I heard from were shocked by the way the Senate handled the hearing by how rude they were and they were very taken by Dr Palese Ford in her testimony because it rang true in their lives\nSo tens of thousands of people were protesting because they felt they weren't being hurt they felt that this group of senators six of whom had voted against the violence against women act were not representative of\nI'm from Massachusetts General hospital using research to develop treatments for a complex conditions all the help their patients get back to live [noise]\nMass General revolutionizing care [noise]\nLooking back to our candidate for him with the Republican and democratic nominees for New Hampshire's second congressional district Republican state Representative Steve Negron an incumbent congresswoman and mclane Kuster I'm Laura ... along with any parents casing McDermott and Casey next question is from your place\nYou've defended your decision not to support a ban on conversion therapy for algae be teach you use but a number of major medical organizations including the American Academy of pediatrics have denounced conversion therapy sang it can cause long term harm to children how do you square that perspective from medical experts with your vote against banning the practice\nRight you know just like any legislation you have to look at the building his totality and so when I voted against it when you looked at the reason I voted against it took the right of a parent\nTo seek the right treatment for his or her child and I think that's fundamentally wrong I think a parent has a responsibility within a with or without the medical community debts my child and I know what's best for my child and I should be able to have a decision process and that and that bill took that right away from me as a parent and that's why I voted against it would you support\nA modified version of the bell taking into account some about expert\nPerspective absolutely I think if you looked at a building you looked at what they were trying to do with some things in there that absolutely should not be done clearly\nBut when it's all boils down to one and as a parent you know if there was an opportunity for us to really look at the bill and make it a better bill I Would absolutely entertainment but you know I get I get very defensive when somebody in the government tries to tell me as a parent what I can do with my child\nI'm next to congressman Custer ah looking more broadly at your campaign\nDollars toward your reelection campaign including about a third of that from PACs some of your top contributors include major insurers financial forums other corporations um what'd you say to voters who might question your ability to represent the interests of everyday citizens when so much of your money comes from these groups\nWell most of our money comes from individuals here in New Hampshire and around the country and I'm definitely proud of that and the point is we need comprehensive immigration a comprehensive campaign finance and that's one of the first bills that Democrats will bring in in January if we win back the house in November\nAnd what's important about that is that\nThe program that we have is transparent you can see that you can look at the records it doesn't impact my voting but these are expensive elections the Koch brothers than four million dollars against me in two thousand fourteen\nAnd I'm going to defend the people in this state against that outside money what is going on regulated is the dark money the millions of dollars that are being spent\nBy Republicans corporations Koch brothers and others\nThat has no no transparency and no accountability whatsoever at all and so that's what we're going to do its cold we the people and it's a set of reforms that will reform our campaign finance and I very much look forward to that system\nAre you saying that there is no dark money on the Democratic side comes from and not coming into New Hampshire no\nNot coming into New Hampshire so to address what Casey said um you know some Republicans and some Democrats said I'm a little concerned about all that big corporate money that the congresswoman is is getting I just I'm just wondering how you can reassure people to follow up on\nWhat you need to understand is those pack contributions are limited there five thousand dollars in the primary in the general and they're from individual is there from employees so I'm proud to have the support let me use the example of fidelity that has five thousand employees here in my district\nAnd that those people have come forward and pooled their resources and that they support my reelection I'm proud of that I don't have any problem with that\nI'd like to turn to the issue of guns gun violence gun control this has been a big issue during this election season and a congressman Custer\nTo you first in February you called for quote meaningful commonsense illusions after the Parkland school shootings you said the right approach protects both school children and the rights of responsible gun owners can you give us one example of an approach that achieves both those objectives protecting the rights of responsible gun owners but also protecting our kids\nSure and there are many examples by the way look I've talked to gun owners I've talked to a teacher's I've talked to people in the community we have an epidemic of violence that we need to control\nAnd one way to do that is to fortify our schools but much more important way to do that is to provide mental health treatment and to\nLimit the risk from these high capacity guns that are really threatening people\nI had a great suggests than the other day right after our forum from a gun owner who approached me he's a responsible gun owner he belongs to a gun club and he said why don't we use those\nUh weapons that we might enjoy in the gun club and so that they are locked and their cared for and I think that's all we want to work with gun owners that are responsible on keeping these weapons safe but right now we've got a real epidemic of violence that threatens people not just in schools that's heartbreaking\nBut in movie theaters in churches in nightclubs and we've got to address this level of violence around the country\nOnce you start saying let's ban this type of gun or that type of gun you mentioned high capacity magazines\nAnd on talking about banning by the way what he was talking about is having them locked in the gun ...\nSupport for any ... live stream comes from you our listeners and from conquered regional visiting nurse association\nA home health in hospice agency serving people of all ages and more than forty one communities discover how the conquered regional DNA can help you remain independent in your home and live life to the fullest\nDid it the RV an A. dot org\nI'm what I'm Talking about is let's find a middle ground I think this whole issue has been far too polarized and we haven't had a middle ground we hadn't had solutions that are widely acceptable what we do know is that most gun owners\nHave as much concern about these school shootings as any other citizen and let's try to meet them halfway\nFind a way that they feel comfortable but things like background checks that's not going to be a problem for responsible gun owners and New Hampshire we can improve upon that the no fly no by if you're up\nA um terrorists you can't fly on an airplane you shouldn't be able to walk into a gun store and I know the Republican talking points love to talk about him is Thirteen I don't think in MS Thirteen terrorists should be able to walk into a gun store and buy a gun so no fly no by is another example well\nLet's talk about background checks into you representative underground please federal law requires licensed firearms dealers to perform background checks on ... perspective purchasers but doesn't require unlicensed sellers to do so although some states do require these unlicensed sellers to conduct background checks\nShould all gun sales are no matter who is selling be subject to background checks\nOr you look at the current laws or we have out there and I just want to make a comment you know when when these these um unfortunate circumstances having like Parkland\nUm you know they want to throw the majority of us as gun owners are are just that the majority is just as these few that have in my mind I think there's some mental issues that have to be addressed and we and we actually look at the instrument and then you throw the whole situation at the feet of the the majority instead of throwing at the feet were belongs and that's where the shooter\nUm and and we need to do better at that we need to understand what the situation what drove that individual to take that action that I was only recourse so when you start figuring out you know what it is as a as a law abiding citizen a law abiding gun owner we had the laws on the books that I think nothing has to change I I mean I'm a proponent of a national reciprocity law\nBut you know what we have to put the blame 'em and the responsibility at the feet of the individuals and those are those people that are perpetrating these or if a guy\nIf that individual who wants to perpetrate an act um did want to purchase a gun from a friend from a gun show a he or she wouldn't have to go through a background check 'em should he or she has to go through a background check no matter where he or she gets\nThe guy who you have to look at the law today right we're going to focus on the engineering there are specific situation where individual are not allowed to purchase a weapon um those are the laws we have in the book today and that's why we call ourselves law abiding citizens law abiding gun owners so if somebody up there that's going to a break the law by purchasing a weapon when he or she doesn't have the right to do that they wouldn't even force a law that are on the books\nI you know I'm a I'm a firm believer that the second amendment is one of the ten that's out there and we're on a slippery slope when we're trying to find his little off ramps to give certain individuals different rights at other people's app\nSo should all gun sales be subject to background checks well\nIf you look at right now when I go when I purchased from an F ill dealer or a gun store I actually do run about yes absolutely\nBut there's other instances where you wouldn't have to depending on the seller's so should all gun sales be subject to background checks no matter who is the seller a no no I don't think that\nNow the question what background checks when a licensed dealer as you know I'm as a gun owner requests the background check the FBI has to complete it in three days if that process for some reason takes the FBI longer the person is able to purchase the gun control advocates called this the ...\nRoof to buy the gun he used to kill nine churchgoers in South Carolina should the FBI representing the ground have more time to conduct such background checks\nWell maybe the system needs to be more robust right a lot of times when you ask them the FBI to do his background checks to whatever reasons maybe they don't have the ability to actually conduct those within three days I Would look at making sure the FBI has all the rights and the ability to do those background checks and the Kurds were days of the law prescribes", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "16"}
