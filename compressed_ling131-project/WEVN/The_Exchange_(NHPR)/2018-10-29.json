being here like young us out secular well an olive you I Want to start with some words from the mayor of Pittsburgh built for to do some very moving where it's a male if you're\nThe outpouring of love and support for Pittsburgh is\nThis time and there is a commonality throughout the world of people who have had enough of this type of page based upon some buddies practice of religion versus some buddies national origin\nThere is the outpouring that is being heard\nThrough the people of Pittsburgh right now of where people wanna see society move towards and it is not about finding ways to

words from Pittsburgh Mayor Bill de Vito and sentiments echoed by leaders here in the Granite State Governor Crist the new new made these statements on Twitter my thoughts and prayers are with members of the tree of life synagogue we cannot and will not the governor said tolerate hatred bigotry bigotry and violence in our society\nAnd no one should ever have to fear entering their house of worship regardless of their faith\nThey got an also said he has directed flags in all public buildings and grounds and the state of New Hampshire\nTo fly at half staff until sunset October thirty first and memory in honor of those last of the tree of life synagogue yesterday said there are some of the sentiments that we heard yesterday\nTom you study racist movements ethnic targeting language political movements that led up to the Holocaust and genocide what's going through your mind right now at this moment I'm\nWell thank you for a I think right away obviously grief I like to start off by um maybe bringing this a little more home and it's reality of one of those who perished or any attack or was the sister in law of the former dean of the state college or one of my former\nColleagues and associates and uh so I just wanted to mention the name of Joyce Feinberg of this morning a nothing a sadly is surprising given the rhetoric we heard the last couple of years to me I have a mixture of of grief of anger\nOr anger that are really to this point I think as Americans we have a real decision to make\nAnd that is basically who do we decide that we would like to be and I think we're in that moment in our history or one of the things that goes through my mind is this sort of idea that we're seeing here somehow unique to the American experience\nAnd it is woven through the fabric of our experience but I Want to be very clear to point out is this is a minority view a firm latest polls only six percent of Americans share the beliefs of the\nWhat's called the ... rice or or the racist movement\nAnd that is the case in Nazi Germany the Nazis or a minority party a and I think it's very important to realize that we are the majority and we have a significant choice to make a whether we follow the minority into fear and terror and hatred or we assert our values of what a republic is founded on\nWell those voices seems so amplified though Tom these days\nAnd that's absolutely correct and uh I think while you're having a show like visit shows the power of the media to diffuse this kind of thing rather than in power which I think we've been seeing on a national level with our media\nOr this isn't an either or choice this isn't a a relevancy question this is a a moment for people like us to discuss really what's at stake and to make a decision as the majority\nRabbit spare set out again um I really appreciate you being here is is a very tough time I'm sure for you and your congregation how are people I'm at temple Beth Abraham feeling and reacting with lots of first there's this\n... and Tom my my condolences for you among your circle to um if you know Jewish people we really are a family I'm Around the world and even though I've never lived in Pittsburgh I Know a lot of people who have and people who come from that neighborhood and for whom that synagogues was an important place in their life and\nUh and they know people there and there's just a lot of personal grieving and um so uh this is a period of of ship of mourning immediate morning and\nUm and some of things that we try to do or just to think about the ways we we bring comfort to people um we were very\nFortunate in a way yesterday at the synagogue it's apple ... that we were already hosting a a big gathering an interfaith anti hunger walk through the city and um so we knew that they were going to be people with us and gave\nUp a lot of opportunity for our ah brothers and sisters and faith from other communities to\nUh to bring us comfort and also for all of us just to be there to come to a synagogue I'm In a place of worship I'm In an open place right the next day and I was cheered by by all that support and and really I think by the courage of people to come\nUm you know without a second thought to a place like that\nSo you were already participating in an interfaith walk for hunger yesterday\nYes and that continued on and it continued on and you know ah ah we're in many ways very very practical and pragmatic during during the morning time we certainly as soon as services were over an Saturday for us and\nAnd uh and I learned what happens we we're we're on the phone during the afternoon and we don't usually do business during the Sabbath um to make sure that we were taking care of of our people and the people who we knew we are going to come I'm thinking about our own security arrangements our Sunday school that was coming so we're really focused on that and\nThat was the next day the first kind of regular day and um and it's the same kind of thing um I Will say that I'm as as worried as we are by this kind of upsurge over the past few years and in anti Semitic\nAttacks and incidents that um that I feel completely safe going to my synagogue going to work today go into services you do I do you don't feel like you have a target on you know I don't and um this was as Tom said one incident and I and even though there's some\nSome some uptick I also I Know and I see that um the Jewish people have never had as many allies willing to stand up with us and for us as we do today I think in our whole history and um and that that helps keep me imbalance\nWell by the way in the introduction I said I'm Saturday Night services I Know that services or friday night Saturday morning so this happened um during the Saturday morning she bought services um Elizabeth I want to turn to you again director of the civil rights unit at the New Hampshire department of justice um what was your reaction when you heard this terrible news\nFrom a personal perspective at least sadness um you know it came in the wake of the shooting earlier in the week in Kentucky on where to black people were killed outside a supermarket\nAnd to echo what Tom said I mean there is this feeling now of of not being surprised that it happened because it's happening with such frequency and and the anger and frustration that comes with that\nAnd so from up from a\nProfessional perspective you know I I really started to think about what I can do in my professional um position and and what the attorney general's office can do in respect to\nNot only reacting in responding to these types of incidents but also you know how can we best support communities that are more affected by these incidents are targeted and then also um re doubling our efforts to not only respond to them but\nTo prevent that and and and through education and outreach\nWell and I definitely want to ask you more if our how your office does that um but you say you know responding\nAnd from Davies tiring auto service in Portsmouth providing complete car care services and know Kenyan all whether retires Davies tire keeps you rolling bright surface appointments Davies

massacre in Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend which as we're hearing has occurred during a time of rising anti Semitism hate speech and heated political rhetoric\nSend us an email exchange it N. H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter ... and H PR exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven we want your thoughts reactions\nQuestions again our number is one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven Elizabeth clay he is here directed the civil rights unit at the New Hampshire department of justice Jonathan spirited that rabbi for temple Beth Abraham in Nashua\nAlong with Tom white coordinate of educational outreach at the center for Holocaust and genocide studies that keen state college\nAnd dumped ... before the break a rabbi spare so that was talking about\nCertain types of language that as he put it you know needs to be called out and I wonder what you hear in terms of language that makes you go that's concerning and that's a signal to certain people that it's okay to go out and shoot\nSure um I think what I've learned over the last Fifteen Years of doing this work is uh I've often isolated\nAnd racism as sort of separate approaches in categories but they all dove tail and they all come together or someone who's an anti Semite is a big are these are the same people just with a different kind of way to express that particular hatred and I think it comes together in our national experience over refugees and immigration and racism\nIn up until the Eighteen eighties we're a country that private ourselves and open borders\nThat shifted post civil war when I'm voting for morning promoting slavery we're re empowered in Congress who then decided that they are going to use immigration refugees as an issue to divide the country again so Nathan eighty two there was the uh exclusionary Asian act where a\nChinese people were not allowed him to the U.S and that was specifically done to rally a a a poor white base that was afraid of losing their jobs\nAnd it's a tool that are sort of in slavery said use aristocratic and flavors to sort of inside the civil war or that somehow or like it's going to free the slaves and therefore it's up to you to sort of fight a war for us the origins labor and so what you often see are the small group of people with the\nOf some kind of agenda who manipulate racism or and fear or for their own short term game\nSo when you're hearing for example that this supposedly refugee column coming toward us is full of terrorists\nAnd then you hear a the administration reference the international Jewish conspiracy that as being funded by ah by a juice who are targeted I mean if I was to say to you\nThat we have a a whole list of opposition leaders targeted for murder and in the same week I say and then Jewish synagogue was targeted and killed while other minorities attack on the streets you would be thinking I'm Talking about Nazi Germany\nBut this is the United states and it's not the United states the majority of us want and so all this language sort of a it's for us we like to reducing some of these categories but it's never that easy\nAnd that's what genocidal leaders try to do they reduced multiply complicated miniature related identity is down to singular concepts singular identities or that they place you in a category they want to be a to be taking care of\nSo I think all these things are are coming together in a perfect storm for us right now whether it be the white supremacist whether it be the anti Semite or those who are seeking power based on division in fear or it is coming together and rooted much in our in our historical past\nYou know more specific question for you Elizabeth I'm we talk about hate speech we do have free speech in this country so\nYou are allowed to say you know I don't like these people um how do you in your office sort of a sort out what's hate speech and what's an incitement to violence um this person who again did the shooting at the synagogue um had some pretty\nFrightening posts on social media so as a general proposition you're correct that the first amendment prohibits the criminalization of of pure speech and so sort of setting that aside\nI think from our perspective it's a huge mistake to ignore hateful speech as sort of being outside that realm of what we should be concerned about and and the reason for that is because\nAs you pointed out this violence begins speech and escalates\nAnd so what we've seen is is is in some ways people trying out this rhetoric and trying out to see what kind of response they get and so if the speech isn't countered whether I'm you know by peers or whomever\nUm it's sort of a sense of message to the speaker that it's OK and people around me must generally accept this proposition and from there\nMaybe it turns into contact and so\nFrom our perspective while we can't um we've certainly I'm aware of the limitations of the first minute places on us and and that should um but we still care from art for enforcement perspective on knowing what kind of speech is out there and so we track on incidents that happened\nSpeech so that we can document it on and make sure that we are providing adequate resources and support to prevent that escalation and whether that comes in the form of education or outreach and and sort of a kind of telling into our fortunate perspective or role um\nThat evidence to the extent it comes from the same person can be used as or that examples of prior speech can be used as evidence of biased and hatred later on in a context of a split civil rights or hate crime prosecution and without evidence of speech is relevant\nIt's so hard though because um [laughter] you know you guys can't be everywhere um maybe you see some concerning post on Facebook or some of these more darker Web sites such as the ones that this man used um so you see it but\nHe hasn't done anything yet so you know and you don't have the staff to post you know somebody watching him all the time and it's really hard to kind of connect the dots before it's too late\nYeah I think that's right and so we you know when we are aware of that particular site or a particular individual redo track it and we also rely on law enforcement and the public to also let us know what they see and whether there's escalation or repeat posts of a similar tone or you know subject matter\nSo that they do that on our radar because you're right it's impossible to sort of monitor the Internet and so all of everyone\nNeeds to be vigilant and respond and and document these incidents as they happen\nIt's so frustrating because every time there's some kind of mass murder you know ethnically motivated or not the killer usually leave you know bread crumbs in the forest so to speak I mean there's usually evidence off and on line that this person had a violent agenda and yet we seem unable to stop it before it happens\nThat's what's so frustrating everybody wants to jump into them\nI I think it really and I just so well said and I'm so grateful by the way that every one of the around the table this morning as we speak our way forward [noise] ah I mentioned before that in Keene a for us we really believe that the strength of America is our communities\nAnd when we saw what happened in Pittsburgh I just wanted to point out that it was you know to Muslim groups who right away row sixty thousand dollars or to help out that community over last couple of days and I have an email this morning\nOr about the loss of hope to his Feinberg from my most of my mom friend from Bosnia who suffer genocide and Nineteen nineties [noise]\nAh so we talk about community to see that illustrated in this story in Pittsburgh but I think also for us in Keene we're very aware of any kind of bigotry or anti Semitism and ah or racism and we have this sort of coffee group that meets every month or so just to inform each other what's going on police mayor\nOr anyone we can get together or who have the eyes and ears of community and so often if anything happens within the day or our office finds out about it the city automatically response documents it so it becomes a community level response which really helps all of us out\nYeah it's tricky though again often [laughter] it's hard to keep track of it all I'm a lot of it's on line and you don't know where it's coming from you don't know if it's just somebody you know posting stuff and not doing anything or someone is going to follow up so bright and please don't have unlimited resources\nYou know and that's why we multiply our resources by all working together and why the groups around the table here can help the multiple at our resources as well\nRather John how do you sort of work with both officers like Elizabeth but also local law enforcement to just kind of keep track on someone who might um [noise] have ill intent against you and your congregation\nAnd well I Know that the national or we have a very close relationship with the national police departments and there's a community liaison who um you know we'd have his phone number for any hour and anytime we have any concern that matter\nThere and responsive and we know that I'm both from the state and the FBI that there are um that their ears and there are people who want to have this this kind of information and um you know there's never any as a any hesitation about that and we're so grateful again in a in a short time how we got a little\nYou know beefed up security at our big event yesterday and um and uh and the people who came were just so I'm grateful and I think showed that to uh to to the national as officers for being there\nAnd from the White Mountain school the boarding

ah ah we're in many ways very very\nPractical and pragmatic during during the morning time we certainly as soon as services were over and Saturday for us and and uh and I learned what happens we were we were on the phone during the afternoon and we don't usually do\nBusiness during the Sabbath um to make sure that we were taking care of of our people and the people who we knew we are going to come I'm thinking about our own security arrangements our Sunday school that was coming so we're really focused on that and that was the next day the first\nKind of regular day and um and it's the same kind of thing um I Will say that I'm as as worried as we are by this kind of upsurge over the past few years and in anti Semitic\nAttacks and incidents that um that I feel completely safe going to my synagogue going to work today going to services you do I do you don't feel like you have a target on you know I don't and um this was as Tom said one incident and I and even though there's some\nSome some uptake I also I Know and I see that um the Jewish people have never had as many allies willing to stand up with us in for us as we do today I think in our whole history and um and that that helps keep me imbalance\nWell and by the way in the introduction I said I'm Saturday Night services I Know that services or friday night and Saturday morning so this happened um during the Saturday morning she bought services um Elizabeth I want to turn to you again director of the civil rights unit at the New Hampshire department of justice um what was your reaction when you heard this terrible news\nFrom a personal perspective it with sadness um you know it came in the wake of the shooting earlier in the week in Kentucky I'm where to black people were killed outside of supermarkets\nAnd to echo what Tom said I mean there is this feeling now of of not being surprised that it happened because it's happening with such frequency and and the anger and frustration that that comes with that\nAnd so from up from a\nProfessional perspective you know I I really started to think about what I can do in my professional um position and and what the attorney general's office can do in respect to\nNot only reacting in responding to these types of incidents but also you know how can we best support communities that are more affected by these incidents are targeted and then also um read doubling our efforts to not only respond to them but\nTo prevent that and and and through education and outreach\nWell and I definitely want to ask you more this hour how your office does that um but you say you know responding to these incidents and um the Anti Defamation league from what I have read says that there has been a fifty seven percent increase in anti Semitic\nWearing off for most of New Hampshire tonight cloudy with a chance of evening rain showers northern parts of the state mixing with some snow showers and the overnight low temperatures tonight and thirties [noise]\nThis is an HBO ...\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... today we're responding and getting your reaction to the massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend which as we are hearing has occurred during a time of rising anti Semitism hate speech and heated political rhetoric\nSend us an email exchange it N. H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven we want your thoughts reactions questions again our number is one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven\nElizabeth clay he is here directed the civil rights unit at the New Hampshire department of justice\nJonathan spirits Tibet rabbi for temple Beth Abraham in Nashua along with Tom white coordinator educational outreach at the Cohen Center for Holocaust and genocide studies that keen state college and dumped ... before the break\nA rabbi spare so that was talking about certain types of language that as he put it you know needs to be called out and I wonder what you hear in terms of language that makes you go that's concerning and that's a signal to certain people that it's okay to go out and shoot\nUm I think what I've learned over the last Fifteen Years of doing this work is uh I've often isolated the anti Semitism bigotry Adrian racism\nAs sort of separate approaches in categories but they all dove tail and they all come together of someone who's an anti Semite as a big are these are the same people just with a different kind of way to express that particular hatred and I think it comes together in our national experience over refugees and immigration and racism\nIn up until the Eighteen eighties we're a country that private ourselves and open borders\nThat shifted post civil war when I'm voting for morning promoting slavery we're re empowered in Congress who then decided that they are going to use immigration refugees as an issue to divide the country again\nSo Nathan eighty two there was the uh exclusionary Asian act where a Chinese people are not allowed into the U.S and that was specifically done to rally a a a poor white base that was afraid of losing their jobs and\nHad used aristocratic and flavors to sort of inside the civil war or that somehow or like it's going to free the slaves and therefore\nIt's up to you to sort of fight a war for us the origins labor and so what you often see are the small group of people with the\nUh some kind of agenda who manipulate racism or in fear or for their own short term game so when you're hearing for example that this supposedly refugee column coming toward us was full of terrorists\nAnd then you hear a the administration reference the international Jewish conspiracy that as being funded by a by a juice who are targeted I mean if I was to say to you\nThat we have a whole list of opposition leaders targeted for murder and at the same week I say in a Jewish synagogue was targeted and killed while other minorities attack on the streets you'd be thinking I'm Talking about Nazi Germany\nBut this is the United states and it's not the I'd say the majority of us want and so all this language sort of a it's for us we like to reducing some of these categories but it's never that easy\nAnd that's what genocidal leaders try to do they reduced multiply complicated imagery related identities down to singular concepts singular identities or that they place you in a category they want to be a to be taking care of\nSo I think all these things are are coming together in a perfect storm for us right now whether it be the white supremacist whether it be the anti Semite or those who are seeking power based on division and fear or it is coming together and rooted much in our in our historical past\nYou know more specific question for you Elizabeth I'm we talk about hate speech we do have free speech in this country so\nYou are allowed to say you know I don't like these people um how do you in your office sort of a sort out what's hate speech and what's and incitement to violence um this person who again did the shooting at the synagogue um had some pretty\nFrightening posts on social media so as a general proposition you you're correct that the first amendment prohibits the criminalization of of pure speech and so sort of setting that aside\nI think from our perspective it's a huge mistake to ignore hateful speech as sort of being outside the realm of what we should be concerned about and and the reason for that is because oftentimes as you pointed out this violence begins a speech and escalates\nAnd so what we've seen is is is in some ways people trying out this rhetoric and trying to see what kind of response they get\nAnd so if the speech isn't countered whether I'm you know by peers or whomever um it's sort of a sense of message to the speaker that it's okay and the people around me must generally accept this proposition and from there\nMaybe it turns into conduct and so\nFrom our perspective while we can't um we certainly um you know aware of the limitations that the first minute places on us and and that should um but we still care from art for enforcement perspective on a knowing what kind of speech is out there and so we track\nOn incidents that happened on line we um receive reports that speech so that we can document it on and make sure that we are providing adequate resources and support to prevent that escalation and whether that comes in the form of education or outreach and and\nSort of kind of job telling into our unfortunate perspective or role um\nThat evidence to the extent it comes from the same person can be used as or the examples of prior speech can be used as evidence of bias and hatred later on in a context of a civil rights or hate crime prosecution and without evidence of speech is relevant\nSo hard though because um [laughter] you know you guys can't be everywhere um maybe you see some concerning post on Facebook or some of these more darker Web\nThat this man used um so you see it but\nHe hasn't done anything yet so you know and you don't have the staff to post you know somebody watching him all the time and it's really hard to kind of connect the dots before it's too late\nYeah I think that's right and so we you know when we are aware of that particular site or a particular individual redo track it and we also rely on law enforcement and the public to also let us know what they see and whether there's escalation or repeat posts of a similar tone or you know subject matter\nSo that they do that on our radar because you're right it's impossible to sort of monitor the Internet and so all of everyone\nNeeds to be vigilant and respond and and document these incidents as they happen\nIt's so frustrating because every time there's some kind of mass murder you know ethnically motivated or not the killer usually leave you know bread crumbs in the forest so to speak I mean there's usually evidence off and on line that this person had a violent agenda and yet we seem unable to stop it before it happens\nThat's what's so frustrating everybody wants to jump into them\nI I think it really and I just so well said and I'm so grateful by the way that everyone is the around the table this morning as we speak our way forward [noise] ah I mentioned before that in Keene a for us we really believe that the strength of America is our communities\nAnd then when we saw what happened in Pittsburgh I just wanted to point out that it was you know to Muslim groups who right away row sixty thousand dollars or to help out that community over the last couple of days and I had an email this morning\nOr about the loss of hope to his Feinberg from my most of my mom friend from Bosnia who suffered genocide of the Nineteen nineties [noise]\nAh so we talk about community to see that illustrated in this story in Pittsburgh but I think also for us in Keene we're very aware of any kind of bigotry or anti Semitism and ah or racism and we have this sort of coffee group that meets every month or so just to inform each other what's going on police mayor\nOr anyone we can get together or who have the eyes and ears of the community and so often if anything happens within the day or our office finds out about it the city automatically response documents it so it becomes a community level response which really helps all of us out\nYeah it's tricky though again often [laughter] it's hard to keep track of it all I'm a lot of it's on line and you don't know where it's coming from you don't know if it's just somebody you know posting stuff and not doing anything or someone is going to follow up so bright and please don't have unlimited resources\nYou know and that's why we multiply our resources by all working together and why the groups around the table here can help to multiply our resources as well\nRather John how to use sort of work with both officers like Elizabeth but also local law enforcement to just kind of keep track on someone who might um have ill intent against you and your congregation\nAnd well I Know that the Nashville we have a very close relationship with the national police departments and there's a community liaison who um you know we have his\nPhone number for any hour and any time we have any concern that matter what it is we bring it and they're they're always there and responsive and we know that I'm both from the state and the FBI\nThat there are um that their ears and there are people who want to have this this kind of information and\nUm you know there's never any as a any hesitation about that and we are so grateful again in a in a short time how we got a little\nYou know beefed up security at our big event yesterday and um and uh and the people who came were just so I'm grateful and I think showed that to uh to to the national his officers for being there\nWearing off across most of New Hampshire tonight cloudy a chance of evening or rain showers and northern parts of the state mixing with some snow showers and the overnight and low temperatures tonight in the thirties them partly to mostly sunny for tomorrow with high temperatures in the forties [noise]\nThis was an HP are\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... tomorrow in our show state officials are looking for input on a four year plan on aging in New Hampshire that's tomorrow on the exchange\nThis hour the latest mass shooting this time at a synagogue leading eleven dead several wounded\nWe're talking about this for getting your reactions one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven send us an email exchange it an H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange our guests are Jonathan spirited that rabbi for temple Beth Abraham in Nashville and\nTom white coordinator educational outreach to the ... Center for Holocaust\nAnd genocide studies at Kean state college\nAnd Elizabeth lay heat director of the civil rights unit at the New Hampshire department of justice one more time our number here in the exchange is one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven and all of you I Want to turn to another issue and that has more sort of down to earth practical issue\nUm and that has to do with security at\nSynagogues and mosques and um other houses of worship especially as we've talked black churches had been\nTargeted um exchange Facebook page got a comment from juice for Trump\nUm who say we need to learn how to defend ourselves every ... should be carrying and make it public if this maniac new congregants were armed um he would have stayed home so that came in from juice for for Trump on our Facebook page\nAnd the president did say that he thought it would have been a good idea if um [noise] the people at the synagogue were armed so let's hear a little bit\nAn armed guard inside they might have been able to stop him immediately\nSo this would be a case for if there was an armed guard inside the phone they would have been able to stop it may be that would have been nobody\nDo it's a very very a\nVery difficult situation then when you look at it we can look at it two ways but again if they ask somebody\nProtect people now isn't it a shame that you even have to speak that way is that a shame that we even have to think of that inside of a temple or inside of a church\nBut certainly the\nResults might have been far better\nAnd again that's president a curtain that sound courtesy of CBS News responding again to the shooting at the ... synagogue and a rabbi spare set ... after the shooting at the church in Texas um I think twenty six people died\nUm a lot of houses of worship here in New Hampshire did go through active shooter training um and I just wonder what you think about that and also this call 'em by the president for synagogues to have armed guards yeah\nAnd and second who pays for that but\nWell you know first of all in the just the the ... of this particular moment and and my sense of responsibility and caring for the people in our community a new visitor community and my staff\nUm I just uh I'm just thinking about their safety and think we have to talk about anything everything I'm certainly even yesterday I heard from members of by congregation they want they want to know that we're putting it all on the table and making a\nA thoughtful and sensible decision and not a really anything in or anything out and I just think I'm anybody whether you're a religious congregation or a place of business or a school has to be responsible about that\nI'm personally as I said and I I feel very safe as a Jewish person walking around identifiable by my my ... my head and uh in in my synagogue and\nI've lived in Israel I visited in Europe prevent synagogues um I Know that there's I Know that there's no such thing as an absolute guarantee of security um and I think I think it makes sense to do the best things that we can that makes sense and we also have to [noise]\nAh we also have to learn that uh what we're going to how we're going to live in an open in an open society so many things were going to do or else and not going to be in our spaces and there'll be really important to rallies the vigils you mentioned that the state house that was out in the open there were no walls to protect that and I think we have to think about all of it\nWell and Pittsburgh's Mayor Bill ... also had some thoughts on this idea of we should have armed guards at synagogues and churches and mosques let's hear again from the mayor Pittsburgh built a new though\nI don't think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues mosques and churches\nI'm filled with armed guards for schools filled with our guard so I think\nWe're we're dealing with an irrational person who acted rationally in trying to create laws around that is not the way that we should govern we should try to stop or rational behavior from happening in the forefront and not try to create laws around a rational behavior to continue\nGetting that Pittsburgh Mayor Bill producer that audio courtesy of the Washington Post olivine let's go back to our listeners lots of people in a jump into a conversation a Melanie is calling in Hi Melanie go ahead you're on the air walk them\nCutting morning Booker but I'm now an economic on on the director of the Jewish Federation here in New Hampshire a first of all I Want to say and thank you for hosting important in a dialogue that taking place I think it's unfortunate that circumstance\nI think it's very timely and very important that we'd be um gathered Jews and non Jews um to discuss these issues so thank you very much um I I Want to speak just briefly um you know we obviously have been very busy she\nUm at our office responding to concerns expressed by Jews I mean there are many Jews and New Hampshire who are also on affiliated with congregations who just simply\nUm practice Jewish life in their in their day to day and our members of less formal Jewish communities I Would say there's the most recent uh\nThe most recent surveys indicated they were between ten and Fifteen thousand she was here in New Hampshire [noise] um and and you know federation has been working really diligently um with all of our community partners to be proactive I'm In these times so for example um in May of two thousand Seventeen we provided\nUm a training in collaboration with the FBI and the ... here in New Hampshire\nUh you know as rabbi John had said we want we want to put it all on the table we want synagogues to have access to all of their resources tools that expertise that they need\nTo make their own decisions about what's right for their community with regards to security and creating a sense of uh of safety in their environment um there are you know twenty or twenty approximately Jewish agencies in the state from synagogues to pre schools to fill out on college campuses where some of these\nUm debates are are especially confrontational and heated at times\nSure why not just ... everyone\nKnows federation is here\nAnd is working with our rabbis in our communities to um to get the resources and expertise in place so that everyone will feel safe\nWell in my garden as Tunisia community decides\nNot to ask you a quick question and I'm so glad that you called and um again my condolences I'm\nSo we talked a lot about sort of practical concerns basic safety armed guards yes or no what about the bigger issue that the mayor of Pittsburgh brings up you know how to use sort of broadly combat the hateful attitudes that lead to violence like this\n[noise] um well I yeah I feel badly because as I was calling and I was speaking with with your your call screener and not able to hear that part of the conversation but essentially um I think that um you know where we're formulating that response and now I'm as a Jewish community you know locally here in New Hampshire and globally\nUm there were you know to New Hampshire families that we know of\nThat a combined lost three people I'm In this attack and we're still getting more information from our congregations but I think that but it's a two fold approach you know one is what can we do\nUm proactively in the realm of education to um both be more present as Jews here in New Hampshire like rabbi John said I'm let's not let us not hide you know let's where are you on that goes on and let our ... candles and be in our community is having difficult conversations\nUm and so what can we do in the realm of of education of being visible and being president and being engaged in a\nThoughtful and meaningful way but also um what can we do to provide 'em you know our our Jewish centers of activity which are all across the state from\nFrom Bethlehem to keen from Congress to Portsmouth what can we do to provide them with some practical tools and best practices and expertise around securing their facilities and an assessing their vulnerability is so that they can feel\nUm you know proactively that they're doing everything they can to be safe and to keep their community safe and welcoming at the same time there's a it's a tough balance\nWelcoming and safe right okay well Melanie really glad you called in thank you so much\nUm and we got an email from Nancy pleased announced the interfaith vigil in Portsmouth\nTonight Nancy says we do have information on our website about the upcoming events and also some advice on how to talk with kids and especially teenagers about this so there's a lot more on our website and H.
