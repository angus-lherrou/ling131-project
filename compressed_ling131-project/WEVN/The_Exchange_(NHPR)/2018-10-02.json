process quote the landscape of mental health\nHas changed significantly since the previous tenure mental health plan was developed in two thousand eight Kim what changes have you seen in this landscape that the commissioner talks about well there's a number\nPlan was silent about children and silent violent um and I think it's really key I mean we're we're we're seeing that we really need to focus on early childhood and um prevention and intervention 'em and looking at mental health issues across the lifespan I mean it really is a lifespan issue I mean there\nThere are issues that are particular to children their issues that are particular to adults and then we have older adults as well so that's one key piece\nUm a lot of research has occurred since then and more evidence based programs and sort of knowing what's worked and what's what's happening around the country than had been around before\nCertainly the um the impact of addiction and co occurring disorders is really key piece that\nThat um has really emerged I mean it was around back when the previous ten year plan was done but still not quite as big hospital closures and the availability of inpatient psychiatric beds um has been a big one\nA local community hospital yeah talk about you know I have left right um although we did have reduction in Bedford New Hampshire hospital I mean certainly in terms of um the economy we're in the middle of a recession back in two thousand and eight when the ten year plan first emerged\nA more now and a thriving economy um and that's a that's different as well\nWow giant changes just listening to talk can fix 'em I'm interested in what you said about if there's more evidence there's more research these days what do we know about treating mental illness now that we didn't know ten years ago and obviously we'll talk about how that might be folded into this plan\nWell I mean we certainly know more and more evidence that we're talking about um biologically based

we're talking about and um and we're learning much more about those illnesses and how they how they manifest but we're also learning about what works and different programs that works um\nThe importance of peer support and strong evidence around pure support has been a big one um but also other other programs and other treatment modalities that are really effective and important\nStealing what changes have you seen ten years is a long time well one of the things that um it's just now coming to light is this study by Dr Vincent philosophy about adverse childhood experiences that study was done in the late Nineteen nineties and it seems like we're just now talking about it\nI think that's embarrassing that it's taken so long to get up to speed on these um\nIncidences that cause children trauma and a lot of mental illness that we see as a result of trauma um there are many\nA genetic mental illnesses but a lot of um what we now know is that if you score for more on this aces test which goes up to ten then you're considered traumatized\nAnd we're sending these kids to school every day without supports in place for them so the numbers are are um growing because we're 'em knowing more I think about this\nAnd we did a show just last week on and you know the child's brain and how early trauma can affect that child brain and you know create all sorts of problems down the line how would you say given your own experience deli um how does your own experience reflect the changes that have happened in the last ten years\nUm I Am actually hopeful in what's been going on in this state um what I like to speed it up a little bit absolutely\nBut Laura when my son was in school ten years ago I fought kicked screamed to try to get the services that he needed at my biggest fight was actually just to try to get people to understand an indivisible disability I'm I'm an invisible sorry\nSupport for HP eyes live stream comes from you our listeners and from castle in the

aces and about genetic and biological mental illnesses\nAnd I'm Glad your son's doing better thank you and we'll probably talk a little bit more about some of the other changes that you've seen deli over that time an air continue to you been in this business for a long time what changes have you seen in this landscape that the commissioner talks\nAbout well as Ken said um you know a real reduction of resources within the system you know from funding reduction of funding which then leads to a reduction in the workforce which creates this whole cycle of low capacity um as Ken was talking about so\nWell and that's a big issue that comes up almost every day it seems like on this program no matter what the topic that their workforce shortages in every single field so just give us a a bigger picture Erica of what the workforce shortages are in the mental health field today [noise] so it spans from\nAll you know parts of the mental health field one in particular is a real um\n[noise] a\nThere's not enough psychiatry I'm particularly child psychiatrists um and that's nationwide um that's just not in New Hampshire on but we have a particular issue around psychiatry and New Hampshire\nOn the workforce at the mental health centers on you there's a I think commissioner minor said last night there's about two hundred unfilled positions within the community mental health centers that's a lot that allow a lot\nUm the turnover the um\nYou know just the vacant positions causes a real issue around capacity\nAnd people having to wait for services so how are you guys at the age you're just trying to alleviate that workforce short well there's lots of different things happening on that um front so\nWe have um [noise] work being done with regards to the eleven Fifteen wave

I'm ... and this is another thing that's really interesting in two thousand and ten this problem didn't exist and in two thousand eleven it existed but it was hours in the lawsuit was filed in two thousand twelve it really didn't just you know talk about the emergency department boarding issue\nYou'd really only became a huge issue\nBeyond that um in terms of you know by two thousand twelve it might have been twenty four hours but by two thousand Thirteen was you know there were eight or nine and into days and now we're averaging fifty and sometimes upwards of three weeks time\nThree weeks in the ER while you wait for appropriate care that's right that's a strain on not just the individual and their family but also the the ER staff which is basically there to you know help people who are in car crashes and\nStuff well they're there to help they're there to help save people's lives and there's you know one of the things that I find very frustrating is I think there's a disconnect I mean obviously people shouldn't be there for three weeks it's inhumane\nBut you know but um yes for a a mental health crisis is also an appropriate place for an emergency room or should be because of this illness and ah people go there to get treatment and but yes three weeks is discrimination\nSure and so you're pushing back on the notion piss people off and say you know ... hours and not appropriate to people they are not trained to deal with mental ... map crises I just said gee out those places for people with heart attacks and car crashes but you're saying no it should be there for everybody I\nYou know ... one of the things other states have done is is to develop a separate crisis unit for um for mental health crises and yes I'm In an emergency room can be traumatizing the sights sounds all of that not appropriate for a person in the mental health crisis but it is still the place to go um for a medical emergency\nAnd you know and and maybe eat you know um [noise] maybe emergency rooms need to reconsider you know ... or hospitals need could reach reconsider how they're dealing with this illness\nThat's really interesting what do you think Erica\nI agree with Ken I mean we've heard a loud and clear throughout the public worms and the ten year planning process uh a few of the key concepts that can just mentioned a mental illnesses a health issue\nYou know and on we had been talking about stigma reduction and we've been pushed back on around that and that it's not really statement it's discrimination I'm we heard that last night at the sea coast um form and [noise]\nThere's um [noise] not being able to treat a mental illness in the same way that a health conditions are being treated\nDoes feel a bit like discrimination it really does so and that's been coming up I'm throughout all of these public forums and the work groups that we had so that's really\nRight now through your monthly contribution of five or ten dollars a month or you can go right now and make that contribution at an H.

D. in order to get that bad\nAnd they said but can I just drive over right now you have a bed no our processes you have to go through the ... through the emergency department here in Concord so we went to the emergency department and we sat and we waited and waited and throughout that weight period my son changed his mind\nHe said I'm not going to do I'm not going to have to oh if I'd only been able to get 'em in the car to get them over there so that process of throwing the E. D. into the equation is such a broken broken process and there are other states that don't do that and they have far more success than we do so we need to look at other models well and our caller\nKen brings up what you said right at the beginning the previous ten year plan didn't have enough focus on children this one should\nThree W.

really key I mean we're we're we're seeing that we really need to focus on\nEarly childhood and um prevention and intervention 'em and looking at mental health issues across the lifespan I mean it really is a lifespan issue I mean there\nThere are issues that are particular to children the issues that are particular to adults and then we have older adults as well so that's one key piece\nUm a lot of research has occurred since then and more evidence based programs and sort of knowing what's worked for what's what's happening around the country than had been around before\nCertainly the um

said about there's more evidence there's more research these days what do we know about treating mental illness now that we didn't know ten years ago and obviously we'll talk about how that might be

but also other other programs and other treatment modality that are really affected unimportant\nStealing what changes have you seen ten years is a long time well one of the things that um is just now coming to light is this study by Dr Vincent philosophy about adverse childhood experiences that study was done in the late Nineteen nineties and it seems like we're just now talking about it\nI think that's embarrassing that it's taken so long to get up to speed on these um\nIncidences that cause children trauma and a lot of mental illness that we see as a result of trauma um there are many\nA genetic mental illnesses but a lot of um what we now know is that if you score for more on this aces test which goes up to ten then you're considered traumatized\nAnd we're sending these kids to school every day without supports in place for them so the numbers are are um growing because we're 'em knowing more I think about this\nAnd we did a show just last week on and you know the child's

I'm I'm an invisible sorry\nUm because they couldn't see it they thought oh bad behavior that's a choice my son was sick my son was really really sick he ended up getting a serious diagnosis\nUm of gets affective disorder um but the schools were well trained to help us um we've come a long way in the last ten years um we have systems in place now we have actually what we call a framework multi tiered systems of support set a lot of schools are implementing\nBut we need that throughout the state we have pockets of excellence\nAnd as a state we cannot move forward we need the department of education to be supported financially would that program so we can grow it right now the department would love six trainers to come on and support schools would empty ss be the ...\nAnd one's empty FSB sorry sorry about that it's called multi tiered system of support for behavior and you may have heard it called PBS or our TI positive behavioral interventions and supports a response to intervention it it has a different names but in New Hampshire a model\nHas been empty ss be and we have um evidence that it's working yeah Antioch did a study\nAnd showed us that our office referrals or down or hospitalizations are down because we're training our staff in schools we need to continue that good work for every school and for every staff member not just the teacher but the school bus driver and the janitor and the lunch lady they all need to be trained about aces and about genetic in biological mental\nIllnesses and I'm Glad your son's doing better thank you and we'll probably talk a little bit more about some of the other changes that you've seen deli over that time of air continue to you been in this business for a long time what changes have you seen in this landscape of the commissioner talks about\nWell as Ken said um you know a real reduction of resources within the system you know from funding reduction of funding which then leads to a reduction in the workforce which creates this whole cycle of low capacity um as Ken was talking about so\nWell and that's a big issue that comes up almost every day it seems like on this program no matter what the topic that their workforce shortages in every single field so just give us a a bigger picture Erica of what the workforce shortages are in the mental health field today [noise]\nSo it spans from all you know parts of the mental health field one in particular is a real um\n[noise] a\n... there's not enough psychiatry I'm particularly child psychiatrist um and that's nationwide um that's just not in New Hampshire on but we have a particular issue around psychiatry in New Hampshire on the workforce at the mental health centers on\nYou there's a I think Mr Meyer said last night there is about two hundred unfilled positions within the community mental health centers that's a lot that I bought\nUm the turnover the um\nYou know just the vacant positions causes a real issue around capacity and people having to wait for services so how are you guys have to adjust trying to alleviate that workforce shores well there's lots of different things happening on that on front so\nWe have um [noise] work being done with regards to the eleventh Fifteen wave or the department has um the integrated delivery networks there's a workforce and\nOversight committee working on different ways in which to improve the workforce issues\nRecruitment on loan repayment a issues uh you know licensing issues being able to transfer licenses from one state to another\nBut also models that we don't yet have in New Hampshire I'm ways in which we can use peers I'm In different ways that other states do on\nPure navigators at the emergency departments um I think the caller Darlene had mentioned that had they had some support one her daughter was in the emergency department that would have really helped so having those peer navigators who better to help families or an individual navigate the system\nEspecially in crisis than other folks who've participated\nGo ahead deli when my son was first diagnosed with kids who affective disorder he wanted to reach out to others that had the same illness and the only way for him to do that was to put it out on Facebook and he basically just said anybody out there that also has gets affective disorder or has a family member I'd love to hook up with you [noise]\nUm we can do better better than that yeah in a club house would have helped him to avoid that although I kind of stunned by that story I mean to just reveal\nYour mental illness like that on Facebook took a lot of courage yeah he actually has him has embraced it and I don't want to see you where's it as a badge of honor but it almost in a way he does um\nHe knows I'm he's different and has challenges but he is in such a good place that he's you know ready willing and able to take those on and to help others um through their journey as well well and it's I mean you're right to wonder if he wears his badge of honor but it is sort of proof that he's\nGone through something really difficult and come out on the other side not cured but managing an coping and so right away it is kind of a badge of honor right yeah\nUm yeah it was hell to get to that I watch 'em and it takes a full team effort um but there is I like Ken said we do need to give people hope and there are success stories out there can what about mental health courts how much attention to these getting this draft ten year plan we're talking about\nWell I Would I Would deflect that want to go but um but the you know one of the challenges is that just should be blind and it's not blind where you live depends on what you have available for special courts we've pockets of excellent ... and mental health courts are not available through throughout the state and they should be\nNot available throughout the states are not what about drug courts is there some symbiotic relationship there are the two separate tracks are two separate tracks but there was certainly a relationship between two All right we'll talk a lot more after a short break and coming up also\nLast night concerning a new plan

P. R. dot org\nRespond on Facebook or Twitter is an HBO exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven and deli champagne Ken Norton Eric ... that's the way back to our listeners and ours is calling us from Hanover\nHi Arthur thanks for being with us go ahead\nGood morning morning oh this is Arthur Gardner in Hanover New Hampshire\nI'm by default emergency rooms and the hospitals are playing a key role in treating people with mental illness at this point I'm urgency rooms are designed principally to treat with medical emergencies like at the heart attack\nAnd not necessarily going to be\nAdapted handling a psychotic crisis particularly one that has to be addressed over days or weeks\nIt may take to get into New Hampshire hospital shouldn't the ten year plan because by default be focusing on needed hospital training programs for people who are stepping goes emergency rooms\nAnd what's your experience as a nation helping ranger provide for such training\nSure and I'm just wondering real quick Arthur what's your own sort of experience with this emergency room my my\nSon has been an emergency room for a number of days treated in a way that I don't think was satisfactory\nOh I Am sorry and thank you so much for calling and this is a big big issue can ... member on this but go ahead we've been talking about this for a long time there's a crisis people can't get help in that moment and so you know they go like Arthur did to the E R with some\nWith their kids yeah I mean I I think a couple of points me when I can certainly say as a family member calling the police and and you know and having them respond to your home is awful\nIn handcuffs to be brought to the emergency room is um is further traumatizing and then once they get to the emergency room [noise]\nUm I think one important point that I Want to make is that most people coming to the emergency room in a mental health crisis or seen and released and so it it you know it's a very small percentage that we're talking about\nThat ended up being boarded in emergency rooms but as I've said over and over that percentage it's wrong medically it's wrong legally it's wrong morally it's wrong ethically and it's wrong economically\nAnd that was the basis of the whole lawsuit right or part of the ... it actually wasn't\nUm because it um and and this is another thing that's really interesting in two thousand and ten this problem didn't exist and in two thousand eleven it existed but it was hours in the lawsuit was filed in two thousand twelve it really didn't just you know talk about the emergency department boarding issue\nYou'd really only became a huge issue I'm beyond that um in terms of you know by two thousand twelve it might have been twenty four hours but by two thousand Thirteen was you know there were eight or nine and in today's and now we're averaging fifty and sometimes upwards of three weeks time\nThree weeks in the ER while you wait for appropriate care that's right that's a strain on not just the individual and their family but also the the ER staff which is basically there to you know help people who are in car crashes and\nStuff while they're there to help they're there to help save people's lives and there's you know one of the things that I find very frustrating as I think there's a disconnect I mean obviously people shouldn't be there for three weeks between humane\nBut you know but um yes for a a mental health crisis is also an appropriate place for an emergency room or should be because of this illness and ah people go there to get treatment and but yes three weeks is discrimination\nShorter and so you're pushing back on the notion because people often say you know ... hours are not appropriate for the people there are not trained to deal with mental health ... map crises I just said gee aren't those places for people with heart attacks and car crashes but you're saying no it should be there for everybody you\nKnow ... one of the things other states have done is is to develop a separate crisis unit for um for mental health crises and yes I'm In an emergency room can be traumatizing the sights sounds all of that not appropriate for a person in the mental health crisis but it is still the place to go um for a medical emergency\nAnd you know and and maybe eat you know [noise] maybe emergency rooms need to reconsider you know ... or hospitals need could reach reconsider how they're dealing with this illness\nThat's really interesting what do you think Erica\nI agree with Ken I mean we've heard a loud and clear throughout the public worms and the ten year planning process uh a few of the key concepts that can just mentioned a mental illnesses health issue\nYou know and um we had been talking about stigma reduction and we've been pushback on around that and that it's not really stigma it's discrimination I'm we heard that last night at the seacoast I'm form and\nIt's true I mean stigma there's I'm\nNot being able to treat a mental illness in the same way that helped conditions are being treated does feel a bit like discrimination it really does so and that's been coming up on throughout all of these public forums and the worker upset we had\nSo that's really interesting because for a long time the narrative has been emergency rooms are not equipped to deal with the mental health crisis is not the appropriate place but you can't seem to be saying maybe they shouldn't be better equipped to deal with a mental health crisis that is an illness\nYou know and you know and so people end up even though they have insurance they're you know they're they're not able to find somebody within their network or they're not able to uh you know they just pay out of pocket\nLet's take another call us with Gina in conquered Hi Gina you're on the air welcome thanks for being with us\nThank you for having they sure I\nWanted to ask if we could steer the conversation a for a moment back to kids um because I think a lot of the issues that we're seeing as as adults are because we don't have\nThe emotional resilience I'm being taught to kids and so I wanted to ask if if in the ten year plan there's something about getting behavioral health or or community mental health services into the schools because it kind of ties into both\nI eat peas and the school districts and it ties in to the opioid crisis and the kids that are left holding the bag when when their parents are are in so much distress as well as kids who have primary mental health issues\nAnd and some of whom may end up with the school safety issues it seems to me that where\nThe huge gap is right now is it is in treating our kids so that they have the resilience when life knocks them down and we all know that that life noxious down it it's a question of how we get back up\nWell Gina thank you for the call and this is something that came up right off the top of our conversation today Ken said you know that they meant a gap in terms of children's services go ahead I'm deli\n[noise] so I'm One of the things we talked about earlier was this empty S. S. B. model I'm Erica and I last week we're on a at a round table and we met in front of legislators and they heard stories of families\nWho struggled I'm In the school district so out of that came and meeting yesterday and I don't want to jump the gun but we met with some legislators yesterday and we said we need to grow this empty ss be modeled throughout the state so we educated them on\nThey bought into it so we have today and Alice are\nThat is going to be submitted a proposed ... that's going to be submitted and we came up with a a a commission to study I'm a further what the schools need so we got some good ears um last week\nAnd things are moving forward and just real quick I Know he said this earlier deli but and she says ... systems of support and then they have here again that's in the schools instead of sort of criminalizing it in sending them to detention that kind of ... her on everybody to understand mental health okay great and Gina thank you so much for that call\nMore on New Hampshire's new tenure mental health plan what's in it what should be and it's just a moment stay with us to the exchange on an HP are\n[noise] say there is Joshua Johnson the host of one a on an HP yards at as a fan of the show I wanted to let you know but we are coming to New Hampshire and you can be part of the conversation\nJoined me for an evening of fantastic discussion about issues that matter to you have to rent it states joined us on Thursday October Eighteenth at the Capitol Center for the arts in hunger you can get your tickets right now at CCD and H. dot com see that\nSport or an HBO comes from you our listeners in New England or the ... in Concord in Manchester offering pediatric an adult patient care to help people with your life better since two thousand eleven New England audiologist dot com [noise]\nFrom New Hampshire iPhone repair offering repairs buybacks and buys feels locations in Bedford board Smith in Salem an age iPhone repair dot com\nAnd from Keene states reference arts at a resenting the music of Tom Waits with Vicki Christina Barcelona on October fifth ... slash read for\nThis was on HBO or\nThis is the exchange on an H.

P. R. dot org again exchange at an age PR dot org deli champagne is in Studio ... community engagement coordinator for the New Hampshire children's behavioral health collaborative\n... executive director of the national alliance on mental illness New Hampshire and ... director of the bureau for children's behavioral health\nAt the ha chess and all of you right back to our listeners and Stephanie's calling from Concord Hi Stephanie go ahead you're on the air\nHi and thank you for taking my call sure\nAh a couple of other points I wanted to talk about have already been mentioned for for me as a parent of a child who is bipolar and struggles with suicidal ... that Ben hospitalized twelve times in the past four years it\nIs really important for our family that in the plan we see increased Medicaid reimbursement there's not enough providers out there that are working for children there's not enough beds for children [noise] um and we really feel that\nIf if there was a better reimbursement more people would be willing to do it some people don't think that [noise]\nFirst night that they're getting ...\nFamily we feel like New Hampshire is just really not meeting\nThe needs while definitely our children what a struggle and how old are is your child or children um that's been hospitalized of so many times\nShe's Seventeen now she um\nShe has spent more time on the majority of her ... hospital stays she has spent more time in the emergency room waiting for that than she did in the hospital and the problem with that that I feel like gets overlooked\nAnd all of this discussion about the long emergency rooms is\nThat the longer she is out of school the less connected she is with her friends the less\nThe less just connected with her community mental health center the harder it is for her to join clubs make connections play sports and the harder it is for her to be successful in school and all of those issues lead her to feel alone\nMade her to feel disconnected and those are the issues that sent her to the hospital and the first\nPlace [noise] so what about the mobile crisis units I'm Stephanie I'm those do exist in conquered have those not been helpful in terms of keeping your daughter out of the hour\nWe did not live in Concord when we originally I said when she was originally diagnose sure she has done amazing since we have moved to conquered okay gets back to that we have\nHad a big turnaround in her care since we've been able to have access to the community mental health center and conquered we did not have have that the first two years she was\nThat she had after she had been diagnosed I've seen my as Ken mentioned I watched my daughter leave in handcuffs that is a traumatic thing not only for her or me but for her siblings to watch the police come in and have to hand cut her and lift her up and carry her out of the house to bring her to an ER to sit\nAnd an ER the ears not a therapeutic environment it's supposed to be temporary it's supposed to be where we're going to manage this crisis and keep her safe until she can have a bed\nAt a stay at the state hospital or a private hospital there's just not enough beds for children so she's had to wait a week a week and a half to then be put in the hospital and be released two and a half days later\nOr is it is heartbreaking and I'm Glad you call and I'm really glad to hear that things are going a little bit better since you've got to sorry to keep bringing us up deli but a pocket of excellence of a city that does have the services something is\nYou know sort of low budget um as a as a mobile crisis unit I mean I don't mean low budget pejorative Lee I mean that it's a lot cheaper and easier to move in when there's a crisis than it is to go to the ER where it's you know\nA big deal [noise] ah one of my sons suicide attempts um I called brought to borrow because there were no beds in New Hampshire and they said yeah we have a bed will hold it for you but you have to go through the ... in order to get that bad\nAnd I said but can I just drive over right now you have a bed no our processes you have to go through the ... through the emergency department here in Concord so we went to the emergency department and we sat and we waited and waited and throughout that waiting period my son changed his mind\nHe said I'm not going to do I'm not going to say oh if I'd only been able to just get them in the car to get 'em over there\nSo that process of throwing the E. D. into the equation is such a broken broken process and there are other states that don't do that and they have far more success than we do so we need to look at other models well and our caller Ken brings up what you said right at the beginning", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "02"}
