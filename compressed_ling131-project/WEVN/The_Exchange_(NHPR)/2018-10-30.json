P. what do you think the state needs to hear from its older citizens want more information is needed I'm\nStruck by what Wendy says for example that you know we have preconceived notions and some of them are not right\nWell I think these listening sessions are hugely important because uh I can think of over Twenty years ago when we had a discussions listening sessions when I was with the state and I'm Twenty years above the median age myself so\nUp in any of that one of the things that people said to us was you know this system is so fragmented and so hard to navigate what we really need is some place we can go get information and help and figure out what we need to do\nThat is the genesis of what we now call service like which has evolved over Twenty years and has improved and has done more things and Wendy\nHas been very active in helping that network ... proof but it's really important to show that listening sessions generated that that did not come from the state it wasn't something we decided it's like people said to us you know we really need help give me one stop shopping give me ... years ago and the ... there was legislation passed\nIn Twenty years later we have what I think is a really unique network and I will say one other thing and that is it a or B is done sort of a survey score card of what kinds of things are working and across the country are service like network is considered to be one of the top two or three\nAnd from losing community services providing services and support to meet the critical needs of upper valley individuals and families more lives in community services dot org\nPartly to mostly sunny across New Hampshire today high temperatures in the forties Italy partly cloudy tonight overnight lows mid twenties to around thirty degrees [noise]\nThis is an HP are\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... today in the state of New Hampshire has just kicked off\nAnd extensive series of listening sessions as it develops a new plan on aging it's asking what services that are older population want and need and where to communities do well where do they fall short when it comes to those services\nThere's an extensive list of places that are holding these listening sessions they just began last week you can go to our website if you want to find out more it's an H. P. R. dot org\nSlash exchange you can also give us a call now one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven send us an email if you'd like exchange\nAt and H. P. R. dot org we can respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange\nAnd um when the men just before the break I could see you wanted to jump in on this conversation that we're having so go ahead\nWell I just wanted to add to what Doug was saying and one of the things that\nI Would in Beijing and finding out during these listening sessions are what are some of those natural or supports that are working communities that maybe aren't necessarily publicly funded by our resource rich in you know the grassroots community um coming around to support an each friendly\nWhat you're talking about so and so for example the transportation solutions that we're seeing some of the caregiver supports a that we're seeing in different communities the village network um the alliance for healthy aging\nA group has been you know discovering what age friendly communities would look like and really starting to start planning\nFor what their communities want to look like in the future I'm also planning commissions around the state or working towards this area and engaging with their communities around this topic and we can leverage that information in our state plan in addition to doing the listening sessions\nAnd I also wanted to to say that I think it's important for us to be working towards that as we plan is looking at how we may pay for our long term care lunch here that you are dollars\nQuestion right right so as we talk about this whole you know system of services obviously we have the um the adjustment bureau elderly adult services but it's not just that right I mean there's\nCommunity groups as a A R P I'm so when we say I'm Chris I'll turn to the system of adult services I mean who is that and he was responsible for it by the way I mean the state can't take care of everybody\nAnd I think that's where we need to look at partnering with our local communities and determining OK in those communities that are aged friendly\nWhat are the supports that the state needs to provide to supplant some of those existing services and not take over what exists naturally for a family and in a community and how to our services best support a family to care for their\nFamily member to have a family member utilizes the resources of their friends and neighbors\nSafe communities and how do we best support our efforts to enhance it and we're looking at lots of different ways within the bureau of elderly adult services to look at having our rules be more flexible having our funding streams respond to the needs we see today and that we will see in the future go ahead and\nGet an a A R P is working on a major friendly initiative and we've got several communities around the state that are joining that and the thing about that is that as an opportunity for community to decide what they need you know it was transportation their main issue really want to make sure that have a walkable downtown do they want to make sure\nThat they have appropriate caregivers and\nA porch Memphis signed up and gosh town and we've worked to his entire southern New Hampshire planning commission the White Mountain region or around Conway is involved in this so this is really bubbling up as I say from the community\nI think we did a program a while back on how age friendly communities actually satisfy a lot of what um the millennial generation supposedly wants as well um walkable public transit\nAbsolutely like my daughter lives in Portsmouth and if she could live without a car she'd be happy\nWell again you can join us with your comments and questions one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven what do older granted staters need where does the state and its communities do well where do they fall short when it comes to\nMeeting the needs of older citizens again we'd love to hear from you one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven send us an email exchange at an H. P. R. dot org so we're border earlier I'm Doug talked about a a real shortage of caregivers in the state and\nYou know there's a workforce voted no matter what industry you talk about but um what have you seen in your reporting in terms of a elder caregiver a worker short a shortage [noise]\nIt's ongoing it's getting ...\nSeveral factors that are\nComplicating the landscape and New Hampshire it's it's\nThere's a lot of competition or from retail and any sort of service a job that could be potentially more well paying even fast food so that if somebody has a heart for caregiving they might start out at that and think it's wonderful but it's so emotionally and physically demanding\nThat they'll get to the point where oh my gosh you know maybe I can make Fifteen dollars an hour if I if I work at a fast food place or work at a work as a toll collector and I just won't I'll have better benefits I I um I won't get so burned out so [noise]\nI think that the challenge is to bring new people and to make them to ... to to make them feel valued in what they do\nAnd tracked him to that profession as potentially a long term career okay you may start out as a nurse's aid but there are many options for continuing on and you can get scholarships in and help from individual nursing homes to continue your education\nTo become an L. P. N. or an R. N. so it's really not a closed door there\nI think um we just have to value that more people really do\nWhy is the pay so low somebody can make more as a toll collector working at target and I think is increasing its wages to Fifteen dollars an hour or so why is the pay so low Roberta\nAnd is that then yeah but again it that that's complicated um\nIt's easy to point to Medicaid reimbursement rates as a problem I'm In New Hampshire we have a we're about the the second lowest in the country right now\nAnd it would be helpful if that could go up slightly and be dedicated to increasing wages for for nurses aides\nAnd other caregivers um [noise]\nUh uh beyond that I don't know I think um [noise]\nI think nursing homes I'm always struggle financially to provide the range of services needed I'm Out in the community it can get very expensive\nFor people um the the uh\nThere's a big disconnect between what a caregiver earns and what someone will pay for that in home care shores hang pays a lot more than ... twenty six dollars an hour what are they complaining about right but there's administrative costs there's health insurance there's all these things\nThat make up the difference between the tend to Thirteen dollars an hour or fourteen dollars an hour and twenty six I see so [noise] it was not like what it looks like on paper no it isn't you're jumping Chris\nI think one of the we do need to look at rates the rates are only one piece of the puzzle because we still have demographic trends that are impacting New Hampshire and so we need to think about beyond the rate how can we\nBring more workers to the workforce and I know I'm I Want to chime in 'cause I Know a A R P is really looking at how do we take advantage\nAnd um some of our older workers who may be retired but are looking for a second career with value and purpose and can we engage some of those individuals to help us with the workforce also some of the things we're working on\nThrough the bureau an elderly in adult services and within the department as how do we provide support to families and caregivers so individuals' can stay at home for as long as possible\nAs well as adjusting some of our services we've recently added um that the dollar amount you can have to do a modification to your home\nIf they need a modification so what's the point is do we need to put in place to enhance people to stay at home for as long as he got that the goal rats that would be the goal absolutely\nRoberta I've rented to some some really good initiatives that ... that are not very expensive for communities to do and one of the things that would be very helpful is if there could be greater sharing between communities of ideas and ways to make these things work um there are two things that really stand out um\nAnd from New Hampshire school administrators association cosponsors of the Christian McAuliffe technology conference in Manchester November twenty seven to ... an agency empty seat or\nAre these are mostly sunny for today with high temperatures in the forties and it'll be partly cloudy tonight lows tonight mid twenties to around thirty degrees\nThis was on HBO or\nThis is the exchange ... tomorrow night show author and UNH professor Tom hands on his quest\nTo close the gap between energy consumption and production\nThat's tomorrow on the exchange this hour what senior citizens and soon to be senior citizens want and need in order to thrive in the Granite State to contribute to their communities\nWhat do you think send us an email exchange and H. P. R. dot org respond or Facebook or Twitter at an HBO exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven we're talking about this because the state has just kicked off an extensive series of listening sessions\nTo understand the needs of older adults as it prepares for its ah official state plan on aging so again we're asking what you think we're new ...\nSupport for an age yours lunchroom comes from your listeners and from community minded certain family dealerships serving Jean ... and all of us are grown and giving back to the community for over Thirty years from the dealerships dot com\nSeries Wendy ... minutes here bureau chief for the bureau of elderly an adult services at the adjusts and Chris ... director of the division among term supports\nAnd services at the age I just and uh just before the break all of you Chris mentioned the family issue and certainly you know um if seniors are lucky they've got a family kind of backing them up trying to figure out what to do this brings up the so called sandwich generation that you mentioned earlier Wendy so I'd like to ask you\nYou know beyond sort of focusing on the individual older person themselves how are you hoping to better integrate the family\nSo I think that it's just bringing to light 'em that there is a family network um for individuals that's not necessarily the case for every person who's aging I'm some have more of a support system than others but we do recognize that\nI'm In that whole person approach and in customizing how we provide services to individuals that families can be very important to them and their support system they sometimes provide the majority of the care uh for individuals whether that's a children and grandchildren and so on\nFamilies friends neighbors um so we have to take into consideration what that circle of support is for that individual and how that how that works and are there any needs or gaps around that that we can help\nWell some of that's not within your control do right and I mean some people would say yeah I could help out my dad more if I could get some time off of work but that's not really something that you're a bureau can\nCan help with sure but I think we need to be part of the discussion and part of advocating for what we're seeing in terms of ... where are you seeing so\nFor me personally and for others who are my age I Do see a lot of people who are beginning to think about what's going to happen in ten years and how do I planned for that\nUm in terms of aging parents aging grandparents and how that might impact my daily life\nMy ... my work and be thinking about um if ... if I'm thinking of it and it may impact my life how it may impact others\nUm and just having the conversation and thinking about it in terms of how do we incorporate some of this into our state plan to say it should be on our radar\nWe're not necessarily going to solve some of these issues at the listening sessions or with in our state plan but it's starting the conversation and beginning to advocate for it\nSo you're really hoping and I think he said this earlier windy you're really hoping that these listening sessions that again family members will come not just people of the older generation right now but family members will come and say this is what I really need help with this is what is really lacking for me to do what I Want to do by my older loved one\nYes and another thing that we're seeing too is the need to really have those conversations with employers around being flexible around caregiving 'em and family caregiving and ah bringing to light some of the needs a and conversations that need to happen\nFor their employees because their employees are valuable to them but they also need to be able to have that balance\nGo back to our listeners and I'm calling from up some Hi Mike you're on the air welcome\nThem very good morning or new fine go ahead Mike okay shortly were treated for my full time or to a patient and I spent almost\nAnd my health plan covered my wife and myself when I retired at a more free however what has happened is I have a son\nAnd he's he's not working guys may have an age are still educational\nTo put him on my health care plan would have been either undergoes a month which are about you know twenty thirty percent of my ... of my retirement check\nSo instead I have a part time job where I can purchase my health care for about two hundred dollars a month and Patrick\nWow so you're working to help pay for your son's health care Mike is that what I'm hearing\nThat for a short while I'm not certain that there are others in similar situations our grandparents who are taking care of their grandchildren or that type of thing\nWill make I'm Glad you called and I'm Wondering if this is something you hear about a lot Doug you know older adults who are taking care of adult children um no I didn't ask Mike this but sometimes there are situations that come up and we've heard a lot about\nOpioid crisis for example I'm definitely heard a lot about grand parents taking care of a kid so yeah that's I'm Mike that's a heavy load yeah\n[noise] yeah I I I don't know the answer to the question without knowing more details I mean certainly that was one of the reasons we push for Medicaid expansion which we hope to would help people who would not be eligible for insurance and I you know again I\nUh my suggestion to him as to check and see maybe go to service lake and find out what ... if there are any other programs that his son might be eligible for I mean we have to depend on without ... I mean unfortunately without knowing the details or it's pretty hard to to uh\nTo to resolve that I just wanted to touch on a couple of things I'm Wendy talked about are you talking about family leave and really that's another issue that we haven't discussed because family leave\nHas another aspect to it and that is for somebody taking care of\nTheir aging parents or their spouse or something of it in terms of a baby think of it is well you know we're taking your younger people but it really can be flipped the other way and that's something that we're working on it I Know that there's a lot of discussion\nAnd there's really I I Hope given a you know if you follow the gubernatorial election but a lot of discussion of that um the other thing is we've done some other legislation on some sort of subsidiary things that are helpful\nUm we passed something called the CARE Act which allow caregivers to get information and support when they are taking their loved one home from the hospital I Know that these things are not necessarily the the be all and end all but\nThose are the kinds of things are hopefully help caregivers continue to do what they need to do I'm a runner reasonable\nWell in the department of every little bit helps and since you mentioned service link for our caller Mike and Mike good luck to you and just you mentioned at the beginning of the show Doug how important this was how this was a great idea that was generated from the ground up\nSome seniors do not have Internet access so even though I've been saying for resources for information go to our website and each PR dot org slash exchange does a ton there\nUm I Know one senior particular who does not have Internet access or I'm not naming names so can you just give us an e the phone number ... for service thing okay how about you I'm Wendy go ahead\nYes so our system of access and service ... we have Thirteen locations around the states that somebody wants to talk to somebody in person we do have locations around the state where somebody could walking or make an appointment\nBut we do have a national toll free number which is eight six six six\nFor one too and and that will route individuals to their local service like office and what you're into that again just for those again for those folks who don't have Internet I sure it's eight six six six three for nine four one to okay\nThank you again for the call Mike and good luck to you lots of emails coming in I'm Angie said\nHave you been hearing about heavy lifting needs I see my parents five to seven days a week and he says and bring firewood upstairs and forty pound bags of pellets for their main heat source and I love the bags of dog food up the stairs wow a is there a volunteer organization that provides the heavy lifting for other seniors\nThis isn't about feeding or bathing a clothing mostly just heavy lifting some people can afford extra help but most won't ask Andy it's a great point um they might want to jump in on that just help carrying heavy stuff\nThat's great these are things that we expect to hear during listening sessions and we have hurt in the past often times we do make those referrals to the service link office and the local\nW.

P. what do you think the state needs to hear from its older citizens want more information is needed I'm\nStruck by what Wendy says for example that you know we have preconceived notions and some of them are not right\n[noise] well I think these listening sessions are hugely important because uh I can think of over Twenty years ago when we had a discussions listening sessions when I was with the state and I'm Twenty years above the median age to myself so\nUp in any of that one of the things that people said to us was you know this system is so fragmented and so hard to navigate what we really need is some place we can go get information and help and figure out what we need to do\nThat is the genesis of what we now call service like which has evolved over Twenty years and has improved and has done more things and Wendy\nHas been very active in helping that network or prove but it's really important to show that listening sessions generated that that did not come from the state it wasn't something we decided it's like people said to us you know we really need help give me one stop shopping give me otherwise they'd go and the ... there was legislation passed\nAnd Twenty years later we have what I think is a really unique network and I will say one other thing\nAnd that is an Arab pie is done sort of a survey score card of what kinds of things are working and across the country are service like network is considered to be one of the top two or three and the whole country so that's really a kind of a great example of what can happen\nMore Catholic Medical center ...\nThis was on HBO ...\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... today the state of New Hampshire has just kicked off\nAnd extensive series of listening sessions as it develops a new plan on aging it's asking what services that are older population want and need and where to communities do well where do they fall short when it comes to those services\nThe extensive list of places that are holding these listening sessions they just began last week you can go to our website if you want to find out more it's an H.

P. R. dot org we can respond or Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange and I'm Wondering ... just before the break that if he wanted to jump in on this conversation we're having so go ahead\nOh I just wanted to add to what Doug was saying and one of the things that\nI Would envision I'm finding out during these listening sessions are what are some of those natural supports that are working communities\nThat maybe aren't necessarily publicly funded but our resource rich in you know the grassroots community um coming around to support an each friendly community um and looking at the example of what you're talking about\nSo and so for example the transportation solutions that we're seeing some of the caregiver supports a that we're seeing in different communities the village network um the alliance for healthy aging\nA group has been you know discovering what each friendly communities would look like and really starting to start planning\nFor what their communities what to look like in the future I'm also planning commission around the state or working towards this area and engaging with their communities around this topic\nAnd we can leverage that information and our state plan in addition to doing the listening sessions and I also wanted to to say that I think it's important for us to be working towards\nLooking at how we may pay for our long term care once that you are out\nOf this question right right so as we talk about this whole you know system of services obviously we have the um ditch as the beard elderly adult services but it's not just that right I mean there's\nCommunity groups as a A R P I'm so when we say I'm Chris I'll turn to the system of adult services I mean who is that and he was responsible for it by the way I mean the state can't take care of everybody\nAnd I think that's where we need to look at partnering with our local communities and determining OK in those communities that are aged friendly\nWhat I had the support that the state needs to provide to supplant some of those existing services and not take over what exists naturally for a family and in a community and how our services best support a family to care for their\nFamily member to have a family member utilizes the resources of their friends neighbors\nFaith communities and how do we best support our efforts to enhance at and we're looking at lots of different ways within the bureau of elderly adult services to look at having our rules be more flexible having our funding streams respond to the needs we see today and that we will see in the future go ahead than\nAn a A R P is working on a beach friendly initiative and we've got several communities around the state that are joining that and the thing about that is that as an opportunity for community to decide what they need you know it was transportation their main issue so they want to make sure that have a walkable downtown to they want to make sure\nThat they have appropriate caregivers and\nA port Smith is signed up and gosh town and we worked was in the entire southern New Hampshire planning commission the White Mountain region or around Conway is involved in this so this is really bubbling up as I say from the community\nI think we did a program a while back on how age friendly communities actually satisfy a lot of what um the millennial generation supposedly wants as well um walkable public transit\nAbsolutely let my daughter lives in Portsmouth and if she could live without a car she'd be happy\nSure well again you can join us with your comments and questions one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven what do older granted staters need where does the state and its communities do well where do they fall short when it comes to\nMeeting the needs of older citizens again we'd love to hear from you one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven send us an email exchange at N. H. P. R. dot org so reporter earlier I'm Doug talked about a a real shortage of caregivers in the state and\nYou know there's a workforce shortage and no matter what industry you talk about but um what have you seen in your reporting in terms of a elder caregiver a worker short a shortage\nIt's ongoing it's getting worse ah there are several factors that are\nComplicating the landscape and New Hampshire [noise] it's it's\nThere's a lot of competition or from retail and any sort of service a job that could be potentially more well paying even fast food\nSo that if somebody has a heart for caregiving they might start out at that and think it's wonderful but it's so emotionally and physically demanding\nThat they'll get to the point where oh my gosh you know maybe I can make Fifteen dollars an hour if I if I work at a fast food place or work at a work as a toll collector and I just won't I'll have better benefits I I um I won't get so burned out so [noise]\nI think that the challenge is too\n... to ... to to make them feel valued in what they do\nAnd tracked him to that profession as potentially a long term career okay you may start out as a nurse's aid but there are many options for continuing on and you can get scholarships in and help from individual nursing homes to continue your education\nTo become an L. P. N. or an R. N. so it's really not a closed door there\nI think um we just have to value that more people really do why is the\nPay so low somebody can make more as a toll collector or working at that target I think is increasing its wages to Fifteen dollars an hour so why is the pay so low Roberta\nAnd is that then yeah but again it that that's complicated um it's easy to point to\nMedicaid reimbursement rates as a problem I'm In New Hampshire we have we're about the the second lowest in the country right now and it would be helpful if that could go up slightly and be dedicated to increasing wages for for nurses aides\nAnd other caregivers um [noise]\nUh uh beyond that I don't know I think um [noise]\nI think nursing homes I'm always struggle financially to provide the range of services needed\nOut in the community it can get very expensive\nFor people um the the uh there's a big disconnect between what a caregiver earns and what someone will pay for that in home care\nShores hang pays a lot more than ... twenty six dollars an hour what are they complaining about right but there's administrative costs there's health insurance there's all these things\nThat make up the difference between the tend to Thirteen dollars an hour or fourteen dollars an hour and twenty six I see so [noise] it was not like what it looks like on paper no it isn't you're jumping Chris I think\nOne of the we do need to look at rates the rates are only one piece of the puzzle because we still have demographic trends that are impacting New Hampshire and so we need to think about beyond the rate how can we\nBring more workers to the workforce and I know I'm I Want to chime in 'cause I Know a A R P is really looking at how do we take advantage\nAnd um some of our older workers who may be retired but are looking for a second career with value and purpose and can we engage some of those individuals to help us with the workforce also some of the things we're working on\nTo the bureau an elderly in adult services and within the department of how do we provide support to families and caregivers so individuals can stay at home for as long as possible as well as adjusting some of our services we've recently added\nUm that the dollar amount you can have to do a modification to your home so someone can stay at home longer if they need a modification so what supports do we need to put in place to enhance people to stay at home for as long as because that's the goal rats that would be the goal absolutely\nRoberta I've rented to some some really good initiatives that ... that are not very expensive for communities to do and one of the things that would be very helpful is if there could be greater sharing between communities of ideas and ways to make these things work um there are two things that really stand out um\nHim from listened community services offering services to neighbors and mean and the upper valley feeling housing assistance summer camps and community dinners listen community services dot org [noise]\nPartly cloudy tonight and we'll have low temperatures mid twenties around thirty degrees [noise]\nThis is an HP are\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... tomorrow night show author and UNH professor Tom hands on his quest\nTo close the gap between energy consumption and production\nThat's tomorrow in exchange this hour what is senior citizens and soon to be senior citizens want and need in order to thrive in the Granite State to contribute to their communities what do you think send us an email exchange and H. P. R. dot org respond or Facebook or Twitter at an HBO exchange will give us a call one eight hundred\nEight nine to fix for seven seven we're talking about this because the state has just kicked off and extensive series of listening sessions\nTo understand the needs of older adults\nAs it prepares for its ah official state plan on aging so again we're asking what you think we're in New Hampshire is doing well for older generations what could be improved again our number one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven we forget stuck notice here associate state director of advocacy for A. R. P. New Hampshire\nRoberta Baker reporter for the union leader where she writes about aging for the silver linings series Wendy ... minutes here bureau chief for the bureau of elderly and adult services at the age of ...\nAnd ... director of the division a long term supports\nAnd services at the ha chess and just before the break all you Chris mentioned the family issue and certainly you know um if seniors are lucky they've got a family kind of backing them up trying to figure out what to do this brings up the so called sandwich generation that you mentioned earlier Wendy so I'd like to ask you\nYou know beyond sort of focusing on the individual older person themselves how're you\nSo I think that it's just bringing to light 'em that there is a family network um for individuals that's not necessarily the case for every person who's aging I'm some have more of a support system than others but we do recognize that\nI'm In that whole person approach and in customizing how we provide services to individuals that families can be very important to them and their support system they sometimes provide the majority of the care uh for individuals whether that's a children grandchildren and so on\nFamilies friends neighbors um so we have to take into consideration what that circle of support is for that individual and how that how that works and are there any needs or gaps around that that we can help\nWell some of that's not within your control do writing I mean some people would say yeah I could help out my dad more if I could get some time off of work but that's not really something that you're a bureau can\nCan help with sure but I think we need to be part of the discussion and part of advocating for what we're seeing in terms of ... where are you seeing so\nFor me personally and for others who are my age I Do see a lot of people who are beginning to think about what's going to happen in ten years and how do I planned for that\nUm in terms of aging parents aging grandparents and how that might impact my daily life\nMy ... my work and be thinking about um if ... if I'm thinking of it and it may impact my life how it may impact others\nUm and just having the conversation and thinking about it in terms of how do we incorporate some of this into our state plan to say it should be on our radar\nWe're not necessarily going to solve some of these issues at the listening sessions or with in our state plan but it's starting the conversation and beginning to advocate for it\nSo you're really hoping and I think you said this earlier Wendy you're really hoping that these listening sessions that again family members will come not just people of the older generation right now but family members will come and say this is what I really need help with this is what is really lacking for me to do what I Want to do by my older loved one\nYes and another thing that we're seeing too is the need to really have those conversations with employers around being flexible around care giving 'em and family caregiving and ah bringing to light some of the needs a and conversations that need to happen\nFor their employees because their employees are valuable to them but they also need to be able to have that balance\nGo back to our listeners and I'm like going from up some Hi Mike you're on the air welcome\nThen very good morning and we're hurting you fine go ahead Mike\nOkay very shortly\nAre retarded for my full time or to a patient I spent almost ... years and was Clint covered my wife and myself when I retire to the wall street however\nAs happened is the frog and he's learning he's not working goes over the age\nOf store your educational\nTo put him on my ... and we're going to do more of which are about you know twenty thirty percent of my mind for retirement jerk [noise]\nSo in part time job where I can ... healthcare for about two hundred dollars worth of Patrick\nWow so you're working to help pay for your son's health care my 'cause that's what I'm hearing\nThere are others in similar situations our grandparents who are taking care of their grandchildren that type of thing\nWell Mike I'm Glad you called and I'm Wondering if this is something you hear about a lot Doug you know older adults who are taking care of adult children um now I didn't ask Mike this but sometimes there are situations that come up on we've heard a lot about\nOpioid crisis for example I'm definitely heard a lot about grandparents taking care of\nA kids so yeah that's I'm Mike that's a heavy load\n[noise] yeah I I I don't know the answer the question without knowing more details I mean certainly that was one of the reasons we push for Medicaid expansion which we hoped would help people who would not be eligible for insurance and I you know again I\nAh my suggestion to him as to check and see maybe go to service way could find out what ... if there are any other programs that his son might be eligible for I mean it would have to depend on who I mean unfortunately without knowing the details or pretty hard to to uh\nTo to resolve it I just wanted to touch on a couple of things I'm Wendy talked about are you talking about family leave and really that's another issue that we haven't discussed because family leave\nHas another aspect to it and that is for somebody taking care of\n'em their aging parents or their spouse or me off of it in terms of the baby we think of it is you know we're taking care of the younger people but it really can be flipped the other way and that's something that we're working on it I Know that there's a lot of discussion\nAnd there's really I I Hope given the you know if you follow the gubernatorial election but a lot of discussion of that um the other thing is we've done some other legislation on some sort of subsidiaries things that are helpful\nUm we passed something called the CARE Act which allow caregivers to get information and support when they are taking their loved one home from the hospital I Know that these things are not necessarily the be all and end all but\nThose are the kinds of things that hopefully help caregivers continue to do what they need to do I'm a reasonable\nWell in the department of every little bit helps and since you mentioned service link for our caller Mike and Mike good luck to you and just you mentioned at the beginning of the show Doug how important this was how this was a great idea that was generated from the ground up\nSome seniors do not have Internet access so even though I've been saying for resources for information go to our website and each PR dot org slash exchange does a ton there\nUm I Know one senior particular who does not have Internet access or I'm not naming names so can you just give us an e the phone number dug for servicing okay how about you I'm Wendy go ahead\nYes so our system of access and service flank we have Thirteen locations around the state so if somebody wants to talk to somebody in person we do have locations around the state where somebody could walking or make an appointment but we do have a national toll free number which is eight six six\nSix three for nine four one too and and that will route individuals to their local service like office my area that again just for those against those folks who don't have Internet access or it's eight six six six three for nine four one tale okay\nThank you again for the call Mike and good luck to you lots of emails coming in um anti said\nHave you been hearing about heavy lifting needs I see my parents five to seven days a week and he says and brings firewood upstairs and forty pound bags of pellets for their main heat source and I loved the bags of dog food up the stairs wow a is there a volunteer organization that provides the heavy lifting for other seniors\nThat isn't about feeding her baiting a clothing mostly just heavy lifting some people can afford extra help\nBut most won't ask Andy\nThat just help carrying heavy stuff\nThat's great these are things that we expect to hear during listening sessions and we have hurt in the past often times we do make those referrals to the service link office and the local",
