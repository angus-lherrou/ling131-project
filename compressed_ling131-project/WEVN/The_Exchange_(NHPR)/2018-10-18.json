anyway\nThey had he had been there with a conservation officer who had called him\nEarlier in the day um and at that time the cubs were up in a tree and they were hoping that the sour would come by

a modest\n... and able to work survive on their own and then they get them back into the woods\nA couple more questions real quick that direct to number don't despair situation broadly and the specifics in Manchester and then I Do want to turn\nTo a bunch of other issues before your agency including this legislative commission looking once again at the funding um a lot of people in this Manchester situation of said why did you have to kill them um you could've tranquilize them wasn't that an option directing\nThem and down or not in a situation that they were in um when the when the biologist went in there they were on the ground but with most people need to understand is\nUm first of all the drugs that we use to tranquilize with\n[noise] depending on the animal take five to Fifteen or twenty minutes to actually um have the animal go down you know we're not using fence and all and in drugs like that because they're too dangerous for the employees\nBut nevertheless these drugs are controlled\nAnd in our possession on to permit from the uh from the drug enforcement agency as a sub permit T under a the auspices of Steve Crawford who was the state veterinarian and he's the one who actually is got the drug permit\nSo those take Fifteen minutes to take a fantasy it on TV you ride of your audio and I know\nSomeone of my age remembers the all mutual ... wild kingdom you know or standard shooting outta the helicopter and the minute the die hard hits the critter it drops in stands on top of it and Marlin Perkins isn't up on the job or [noise] um and that that is not the reality a little bit of an edit their right ... and furthermore\nWe're not allowed to drive around with those drugs in the vehicle that we have uh the main office and a couple of our regional offices were that stuff is under lock and key\nAnd so when we have a scenario with an animal that we're going to dart um for example uh we did one in Manchester right after this episode where there was a bearing a tree 'em down on a I think it was oak street it was a cub\nUm and uh I'm\nSo we put a team together two to four people go down there they are prepared with the drugs the animals in a tree it can't run around and get anywhere um they they were able to actually get it with a jab stick as opposed to a dark gun\n'em and they ... they\nTake the time to set a net up under the tree so in the animal falls it doesn't get injured hitting the ground and that cub got taken to a to kill arms um\nWe very rarely dart um animals in a ... that are just standing around on the ground in a in a uh especially like a public situation because\nUm especially with a bear or a moose and that Fifteen minutes a lot of bad things can ... who knows what could happen to spend you know in a dense they get out there and even they are not happy with getting a dart it and I'm so it's it's really a different situation than what I'm people may perceive they probably think every officer\nEvery ah a biologist is running around with a dart gun hanging in there pickup truck you know and that is far from the from the service biologist did not have\nThat medication in his or her truck no OK didn't have that option um and and ... even if he did these these bears were running around there was no\nUh you know\nWas no opportunity there to to that you would have had to really use it anyway as opposed to like I say a static situation where the bears up\nPartly sunny windy today with high temperatures in the lower forties Italy partly cloudy tonight low temperatures mid to upper twenties sunshine tomorrow high temperatures mid to upper fifties and then Saturday it'll be mostly cloudy with high temperatures\nMid forties to lower fifties [noise] this is an HBO are\nThis is the exchange I'm more annoying to date and Hampshire fish and game director Glenn Norman do is with us on his agency's role in New Hampshire is great outdoors we're taking your questions and comments about some of the headlines surrounding fishing game recently we'd love to hear from you send us an email exchange it N. H. P. R. dot org\nRespond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange or of course give us a call one eight hundred\nEight nine to six four seven seven and a director number do right back to our listeners and Rick is on the line go ahead you're on the air welcome\nA good a good morning Laura\nHi go ahead go ahead morning\nQuestion was relative to the study commission\nUm as you know we've discussed the number of different issues are relative to finances but we seem to have avoided the efficiency ineffectiveness conversation around the makeup of the fish and game commission but I just want to get your take one on\nOh if you thought that broadening the representation on the commission would help with the revenue stream concerned doesn't department\nAnd this is absolutely what we should talk about wrecked so thank you for bringing that up and I've got a ton of emails on this as well but just to highlight this for the audience that may not be as invested in these issues to the commission is eleven people it is one\nTowns okay and you have to be a a hunter or an angle or to be on the commission the requirement is that you've held a hunting fishing or trapping license five of the previous ten years so and ... no violations within five years right so no poaching are illegal parking\nFish well so Helen sent us an email to this point about the idea of broadening um the representation on the commission Helen says according to a Cornell University on cash strapped fish and wildlife agencies around the country\nThose agencies they were able to change their governance and widen their support base I mean not only cater to hunters and ... like ours do they were able to solve their funding problem it's much more successfully a Helen says the study commissioned that director Norman do is part of it's supposed to include governance in their discussions with the commission refuse the topic they're charged with\nDespite strong criticism from the public why hell and wants to know so Helen thank you and ... thank you and I'd love to get your take on this governance issue I'm directing arm and dumped\nSo let me say that um that the commissioners or governors appointees the director does not have a a\nControl or supervision of the commission and in fact to some extent it's the opposite uh the commission has ah the ah amongst other authorities or it's the commission that sends names to the governor for the director um\nI don't know that's interesting in sorry to interrupt you hear so unlike the you know Jeff Myers ahead of health and Human Services he's appointed by the governor he's in charge and the people who work\nOn the issue is work for him right yours is a little different I'm a little different um and it and it's got to you know it\nGoes way back historically and it's similar around the country committed this almost states have a commission in one form or another um but they vary in their authorities vary state to state\nUm so [noise] you know we've we've heard a lot about you know broadening the commission I'm a ...\nThere's been lots of openings and the commission and lots of people from all sorts of places that have nothing else at least have fishing licenses so it's always kind of bothered me that there's a lot of criticism and yet there's also been recently I mean governor Sununu his completely changed the commission is only\nFor her I think four or five left of who was here before him and several of those will\nBe on the block shortly\nAnd uh so it seems like for some reason people don't come forward\nThat are potentially you know representing another a point of view although they have to have a hunting and fishing licence or ... but you know I mean many people have fishing licenses and uh\nUh but you know it's also a politically charged issue very politically charged and ah because I'm\nYou know as usual is kind of a polarization um of opinion where um you know the the the hunting and fishing\nSort of what what I'll call our you know our old school constituents are concerned that this is just the way for people who are against hunting or and or fishing to get in and try to change you know everything that's important\nTo them to get on the commission right are pushing back again pushing to actually trapping that ...\nGets people are upset although if you go to a state like Massachusetts where they banned it you'd see a host of other issues associated with with the lack of trapping but anyway\nBack to animal conflict um but the uh uh um and the other side if you will um you know I was saying why should we put money and if we don't have a you know some kind of a voice sure um so it's a [noise] you know it's\nWhat what do you think directing army to I mean that's the existential conflict fishing game says hey we don't have enough money to do all these things at the public wants us to do and you guys do a lot\nOn the other hand there isn't any representation from you know voters and hikers and wildlife photographers and so forth so they're like why should I kicking yeah well you think about\nThat well I think it's a chicken and egg deal yeah I mean you know uh I I was struck a couple\nA years ago I was at a meeting um and uh with a ...\nIn my counterpart who are at the time was the director in Georgia great guy named Dan forester who's sitting next to me we were outside of Las Vegas in the largest wildlife National Wildlife refuge in the country um desert a desert wildlife refuge\nAnd we're looking out the window in this conference room and these people walk by and you know they have a\nFour four or five thousand dollars and in a optics hanging around their necks both of them you know ... binoculars and all of this stuff\nAnd Dan pointed over to them and said look at all that and not a dime for conservation you know sure on the line represented Arctic unlike though ... percent that they're hunters and fishermen pay on the equipment that they by writing goes into these federal grants that we get so what do you think what's\nIt do you want to tap into that potential resource but in so doing allow um you know bird watchers on the commission [laughter]\nBird watchers I think that uh that you know for me personally\nIt it it needs to be a a a a step up and be responsible and you know be willing to you know\nYou talk about chicken or the egg so that's give me give me access and I'll pay or I'll show you that I'm Serious and give me money and give the agency money first\nI'm kind of a give me the money first type of guy 'cause I I Do feel that um show us how serious you are I'm about and and help us legislate some things that would be um helpful to the agency\nWe've got an email to that effect from a listener in where and think and I think this person I Can't read the whole email because it's a little bit long but this person says\nI take quite a bit into the New Hampshire fish and game budget but the commission is not represent me I'm a taxpayer monies from the general fund go to fish and game\nI own a gun and go to shooting may just practice the federal taxes on ammunition I purchased circles back to fish and game I have a hike safe card um and I have a registered ATV all of these fees amount a far more than any hunting or fishing licence yet the commission this person says does not represent me\nThe commission must have all have a hunting or fishing licence and I do not hunter fish instead I spend my time in the great outdoors with my camera on my small farm or hiking throughout the state\nI'm In this person says I'm not against hunting for food I'm against the commission catering to hunters and ... and not considering the input of other citizens like me\nWho contribute more than our share of the cost um so this is basically summing up we've been talking about director Norman do as a ... and just to just sort of sum it up and then move on I mean\nWe've been talking about this for a long time it's kind of like\nYou go first no you go you're while it's and it's worse now\nWe're living in a in a apparently a political world where nobody can talk to each other anymore without screaming so ah you know I really don't know what to say about that I mean I understand where he's where that person's coming from and and the correct uh the the the thing is\nThat you know some of those things he said are right I mean we are getting some general funds now and uh\nHelping businesses succeed and the world economy on line at Bob Wilson dot com and from the musicals in the middle of your theories out the historic theater presenting offer soprano Renee Fleming on Sunday October twenty first out four pm\nTickets out the music ... or\nOr at least sending a windy day today temperatures in the lower forties\nThis is the exchange I'm Mark annoy today New Hampshire fish and game executive director Len Norman do on his agency's mission\nFrom hunting and fishing to search and rescue let's hear from you lots of calls and emails coming in our phone number one eight hundred eight nine too sick for seven seven\nEmail is exchange at an H. P. R. dot org you can always respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven\nAnd directed Norman do let's go right back to our listeners John is in Windham John go ahead you're on the air\nAll right thank you for taking my call sir I'm my question about climate change I was wondering what kind of changes you're seeing happening in New Hampshire related to that\nJohn go ahead and do we lose you there\nOkay we'd lost John I Apologize but it's relevant point I mean I'm going to hear a lot about from your biology yeah\nIt's hugely relevant it's you know likely a part of woods uh promoting um some of the problems we have with most because of the winters aren't as hard as they used to be and that allows those ticks to that are that are parasites on most to survive\nA lot easier um you know I uh [noise] amongst other things uh\nUse to commercial ... years ago and I have still keep maintain a commercial lobster license that I run enough traps to make believe I'm Still\nHave a hand in it and I can tell you that the changes I see just down at the sea coast are immense in terms of you know\nFifteen Twenty years ago you never saw blue crabs and your lobster traps you never saw Black Sea bass show up I mean where are you getting a lot of species that used to only be\nSouth of Cape Cod that are coming up and\nYou know for me this is all a real thing I live on the water in Portsmouth um we uh enjoy you know four or five inches of sea water in one of my buildings this past winter ... now I'm like one of those storms exactly\nUh so you know I see it every day and a and I've been watching it for Fifteen or Twenty years in a in a it is happening and saying well\nSo we've interviewed tons of politicians this year we interviewed all the primary candidates leading up to the primary and then we'd been interviewing the major party nominees\nAnd we've heard for more than one politician\nI'm director Norman do that they don't think climate change is really a problem with your message to them given what you see\nWell maybe it may not be a problem for the next election cycle it's a problem over the next couple of decades\nI'm One of the frustrations of being a fish and wildlife in in fish and wildlife management is nothing happens in a to a four year cycle\nI mean I mentioned those turkeys earlier a Nineteen Seventy five to today you know we're talking or however many forty years to get them where they are took us ten to Fifteen Years to reestablish the turn population off the isles of shoals\nYou know we deal on a timeline in fish and wildlife um\nThat is well pass the time horizon of the election cycles and that is true or maybe even true or\nOf of ah of ah the whole or climate change issue\nWell we've got a question from Melinda on Facebook about the most since you mentioned that direct enormous do Seventy percent mortality rate of most cats in New Hampshire this year due to ticks Melinda says we need to act it's not natural selection because this didn't happen naturally\nAsks Kennedy delivered medicine at salt licks or when most art tagged I'm Linda thank you for the question I Want to let her know and everyone now that we're going to a whole show on the move situation on Monday so maybe we'll address the medicine question there but um what are we seeing in terms of moose mortality\nAh well [noise] this is one area where a drought is good okay so when we you know tics need moisture um a couple of years ago when we had a substantial drought through the summer we saw our mortality of cash go down to thirty percent the following year\nUm because the tick population it took a dive and uh but\nShe her numbers are correct in a typical year we've been seeing about Seventy percent cap\nOur uh radio collared cabs and uh um and that is because they can't withstand the the uh um anemia and whatnot brought on by those picks the older animals um can\nAlthough it reduces their weight and may cause the cows to abort cabs and such like mud so that yeah it's it's a it's a tough situation and it's an ugly situation if you've ever seen a moose with a hundred and forty hundred and sixty thousand ticks on it\nWell and I saw some pictures of moose on your website yesterday and they don't look like the pictures of old they look skinny and raggedy and I appreciate the uh the Facebook comment Melinda and we will talk more a in a more detailed way on Monday about the most ... thank you so much and be sure to tune in my day\nPete begins is forgotten more and I'll ever know about most [laughter] lines so those yeah ...\nAnd we'll be talking to some of those folks for sure another caller a Jane from Wakefield is on the line Hi Jane go ahead you're on the air ...\nYes I have been listening very carefully and with respect to direct and on and do 'em but I have to take exception with him laughing at the idea that bird watchers shouldn't have a voice\nI how money is that um he talked about the partisan divide and how people are not seeking civil each ... each other in the political atmosphere and I wonder how he thinks\nA dismissing some people's activities and laughing at dismissing yet ... how does that help having a discourse about this issue that the money that they need and other people could contribute bumped take my response off the air\nWell Jane appreciate the call and bird watching is a huge huge activity or for some folks I have some friends who are into it and it is enormous and they spend a lot of money traveling and on the fancy binoculars and so forth\nSo I get to them and die in a and you know I I certainly wouldn't laugh it off in fact a we have a very close relationship with the department with the Audubon Society um they are under contract with us to do a lot of their of bird work because we don't have in house experts\nAnd we're also financially helping to support the ... fish waves which are are run by them a so um you know I don't know my I got misinterpreted there or whatever but I don't have a I have no ax to grind bird watching and in fact uh\nI uh was it was a big thing for me especially when I was a kid so uh\nWell I Wonder if your reaction was in part I'm anticipating the reaction that\nHumid out from the ... not not who don't want outside interest on the Amish are not the commissioners but the uh but some of the folks on the other side because that's this is exactly the fight that is that is out there\nWhich I Am glad you called and we can uh\nGive us a chance to clear that up and I'm here's another issue that I Want to raise with you a director Norman do it's a big big issue in New Hampshire especially over the summer um and has to do with boat launches Michael in Warner emails New Hampshire does not have a readily accessible\nAll tied boat launch on great bay what is preventing the state from improving the existing law to help them park\nAs a New Hampshire resident and salt water angler I'm wasting time and gas to drive to Eliot or Kittery, Maine each time I fish\nAnd paying those towns a twenty dollar per launch be Michael glad you email them let's talk about the salt water but ... but also more broadly um you know there's been a complaint that ah somebody hamsters best lakes are kind of\nUm tied up by people who have\nThat's kind of look at the lake can allow that looks really nice yeah well let's generally\nSay that um it's all about the money okay so our boat uh we're part of the access program or are we are the access program so I get five dollars from every state bought registration\nA that goes into access which amounts than a typical year to four hundred and fifty thousand dollars or so um that's the same five dollars we got in Nineteen Ninety two when we were assigned the boat access program\nWeight Nineteen Ninety two is a long time ago\nHalf a million then bought a lot more than a half a million today right ah in addition to that we get a some money from a from the four mentioned are dangled Johnson federal grants there's a piece of that it's for access\nUm that we use uh that uh the state money to match\nFive

in any even if he did these these bears were running around there was no\nUh you know there\nWas no opportunity there to to that you would have had to really use it anyway as opposed to like I say a static situation where the bears up toward the bears up and I read it running out into the high end I might just dad here um\nAnd from ideas these shows presenting singer songwriter Gordon my foot in the legend lives on tour of the colonial theater in Keene Thursday October twenty fifth tickets out the colonial and auto [noise]\nThis is an HBO\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... today New Hampshire fish and game director Glenn Norman do is with us on his agency's role in New Hampshire is great outdoors we're taking your questions and comments about some of the headlines surrounding fish and game recently\nWe'd love to hear from you send us an email exchange it N. H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an HBO exchange or of course give us a call one eight hundred\nEight nine to six or seven seven and a director Norman do right back to our listeners and Rick is on the line go ahead you're on the air welcome\nBut good in the morning Laura\nHi go ahead ... morning\nOur question was relative to the study commission\nUm as you know we've discussed the number of different issues are relative to finances but we seem to have avoided the efficiency ineffectiveness conversation around the makeup of the fish and game commission but I just wanted to get your take one on\nSo if you thought that broadening the representation on the commission would help with the revenue stream concerns as department\nWell and this is absolutely what we should talk about wrecked so thank you for bringing that up and I've got a ton of emails on this as well but just to highlight just for the audience that may not be as invested in these issues for the commission is eleven people\nIt is one from each county and one from the title towns okay and you have to be\nA a hunter or an angler to be on the commission the requirement is that you've held a hunting fishing or trapping license five of the previous ten years so and some and no violations within five years right so no poaching are illegal parking fish well\nSo Helen sent us an email to this point about the idea of broadening um the representation on the commission\nHelen says according to a Cornell University on cash strapped fish and wildlife agencies around the country those agencies they were able to change their governance and widen their support base I you not only cater to hunters and ... like ours do they weren't able to solve their funding problems much more successfully\nA Helen says the study commissioned that director Norman do was part of it's supposed to include in ...\nUse the topic they are charged with despite strong criticism from the public why hell and wants to know so Helen thank you and Rick thank you and I'd love to get your take on this governance issue I'm directing Armand down\nSo let me say that um\nThe the commissioners or governors appointees the director does not have a a control or\nSupervision of the commission and in fact to some extent it's the opposite uh the commission has uh the uh amongst other authorities or it's the commission that sends names to the governor for the director um\nI Know that's interesting sorry to interrupt you hear so unlike the you know Jeff Myers ahead of health and Human Services he's appointed by the governor he's in charge and the people who work on the issue is\nWork for him right yours is a little different I'm a little different um and it and it's got to you know it goes way back historically and it's similar around the country committed this almost states have a commission in one form or another um but they vary in their authorities varies state to state\nUm so [noise] you know we've we've heard a lot about you know broadening the commission\nI'm a ...\nThere's been lots of openings in the commission and lots of people from all sorts of places that have nothing else at least have fishing licenses so it's always kind of bothered me that there's a lot of criticism and yet there's also been recently I mean governor Sununu his completely changed the commission is only\nFour or I think four or five left of who was here before him and several of those will be on the block shortly\nAnd uh so it seems like for some reason people don't come forward\nThat are potentially you know representing another a point of view although they have to have a hunting and fishing licence or ... but you know I mean many people have fishing licenses and uh\nUh but you know it's also a politically charged issue very politically charged and ah because I'm\nYou know as usual this kind of a polarization um of opinion where um you know the the the hunting or fishing\nSort of what what I'll call our you know our old school constituents are concerned that this is just a way for people who are against hunting or and or fishing to get in and try to change\nYou know everything that's important to them to get on the commission right are pushing back again pushing to actually trapping that ... gets people are upset although if you go to a state like Massachusetts where they banned it you'd see a host of other issues associated with with the lack of trapping but anyway\nI'm going back to animal conflict um but\nThe uh uh um\nAnd the other side if you will um you know I was saying why should we put money and if we don't have a you know some kind of a voice sure um so it's a [noise] you know it's\nWhat we think directing army to I mean that's the existential conflict fishing game says hey we don't have enough money to do all these things at the public wants us to do and you guys do a lot\nOn the other hand there isn't any representation from you know voters and hikers and wildlife photographers and so forth so they're like why should why kicking yeah well you think about that\nWell I think it's a chicken and egg deal yeah I mean you know uh I I was struck a couple\nUm and uh with uh\nIn my counterpart who are at the time was the director in Georgia great guy named Dan forester who's sitting next to me\nWe were outside of Las Vegas in the largest wildlife National Wildlife refuge in the country um desert a desert wildlife refuge and we're looking out the window in this conference room and these people walk by and you know they have a\nFour four or five thousand dollars and in a optics hanging around their necks both of them you know ... binoculars and all of this stuff\nAnd Dan pointed over to them and said look at all that and not a dime for conservation you know sure on the line represented Arctic unlike though ... percent that they're hunters and fishermen pay on the equipment that they by writing goes into these federal grants that we get so what do you think\nWhat's it do you want to tap into that potential resource but in so doing allow um you know bird watchers on the commission\n[laughter] bird watchers I think that uh that you know for me personally it it it needs to be a\nA a a step up and be responsible and you know be willing to you know\nYou talk about chicken or the egg so that's give me give me access and I'll pay or I'll show you that I'm Serious and give me money and give the agency money first\nI'm kind of gave me the money first type of guy 'cause I I Do feel that um show us how serious you are I'm about an and help us legislate some things that would be um helpful to the agency\nWell we got an email to that effect from a listener in where and think and I think this person I Can't read the whole email 'cause it's a little bit long but this person says\nI take quite a bit into the New Hampshire fish and game budget but the commission is not represent me I'm a taxpayer money from the general fund go to fish and game I own a gun and go to shooting may just practice the federal taxes on ammunition I purchased circles back to fish and game I have a hike safe card\nUm and I have a registered ATV all of these fees amount to find more than any hunting or fishing licence yet the commission this person says does not represent me\nThe commission must have all have a hunting or fishing licence and I do not hunter fish instead I spend my time in the great outdoors with my camera on my small farm or hiking throughout the state\nUm this person says I'm not against hunting for food I'm against the commission catering to hunters and ... and not considering the input of other citizens like me\nWho contribute more than our share of the cost um so this is basically something that we've been talking about directed Norman do and ... and just to just sort of sum it up and then move on I mean [noise]\nWe've been talking about this for a long time it's kind of like you go first no you\nGo you're while it's and it's worse now not better because we're living in a and apparently a political world where nobody can talk to each other anymore without screaming so uh you know I really don't know what to say about that I mean I understand where he's where that person's coming from and and the correct\nUh the the the thing is\nThat you know some of those things he said are right I mean we are getting some general funds now\nDana Farber dot org slash locations and from ...

happening in New Hampshire related to that and what\nJohn go ahead and do we lose you there\nOkay we'd lost to John I Apologize but it's relevant point I mean I'm going to hear a lot about from your biologist\nYet it's hugely relevant it's you know likely a part of woods uh promoting um some of the problems we have with most because the winters aren't as hard as they used to be and that allows those ticks to that are that are parasites on most to survive\nA lot easier um you know I uh [noise] amongst other things uh use to commercials ... years ago and I have still keep maintain a commercial lobster license that I run enough Trapster make believe on still have a hand in it\nAnd I can tell you that the changes I see just down at the sea coast are immense in terms\nFifteen Twenty years ago you never saw blue crabs and your lobster traps you never saw Black Sea bass show up I mean we're getting a lot of species that used to only be south of Cape Cod that are coming up and you know for me this is all a real thing I live on the water in Portsmouth\nUm we uh\nEnjoy you know four or five inches of sea water in one of my buildings this past winter and now I'm like one of those storms exactly uh so you know I see it every day and a and I've been watching it for Fifteen or Twenty years in a in a it is happening thing\nWell so we've interviewed tons of politicians this year we interviewed all the primary candidates I'm leading up to the primary and then we'd been interviewing the major party nominees and\nWe've heard for more than one politician\nI'm directing arm and do that they don't think climate change is really a problem with your message to them given what you see\nWell maybe it may not be a problem for the next election cycle\nIt's a problem over the next couple of decades I'm One of the frustrations of being a fish and wildlife in in fish and wildlife management is nothing happens in a to a four year cycle I mean I mentioned those turkeys earlier a Nineteen Seventy five today\nYou know we're talking or however many forty years to get them where they are took us ten to Fifteen Years to reestablish the turn population off the isles of shoals you know\nWe deal in a timeline in fish and wildlife um\nThat is well pass the time horizon of the election cycles and that is true or maybe even true or\nOf of ah of ah the whole\nClimate change issue\nWell we've got a question from Melinda on Facebook about the most since you mentioned that direct enormous do Seventy percent mortality rate of most cats in New Hampshire this year due to ticks Melinda says we need to act it's not natural selection because this didn't happen naturally\nAsks Kennedy deliver medicine at salt licks or when most art tagged I'm Linda thank you for the question I Want to let her know and everyone now that we're going to a whole show on the move situation on Monday so maybe we'll address the medicine question there but\nUm what are we seeing in terms of moose mortality\nAh well [noise] this is one area where a drought is good okay so when we you know tics need moisture um a couple of years ago when we had a substantial drought through the summer we saw our mortality of cast go down to thirty percent the following year\nUm because the tick population it took a dive and uh but she her numbers are correct in a typical year we've been seeing about Seventy percent cap mortality ... of our uh radio collared caps and uh\nUm and that is because they can't withstand the\nThe uh um\nAnemia and whatnot brought on by those picks the older animals um can\nAlthough it reduces their weight and may cause the cows to abort cabs and such like not so bad yeah it's it's a it's a tough situation and it's an ugly situation if you've ever seen a moose with a hundred and forty hundred and sixty thousand ticks on it\nWell and I saw some pictures of moves on your website yesterday and they don't look like the pictures of all they look skinny and raggedy and I appreciate the uh the Facebook comment Melinda and we will talk more a in a more detailed way on Monday about the most ... thank you so much and be sure to tune in my day\nPeak peak ends is forgotten more and I'll ever\nRyan so those yeah ... and we'll be talking to some of those folks for sure another caller a Jane from Wakefield is on the line Hi Jane go ahead you're on the air with director Norman do\nYes I have been listening very carefully and with respect to direct and on and do 'em but I have to take exception with him laughing at the idea that bird watchers shouldn't have a voice\nAnd I how money is that um he talked about the partisan divide and how people are not speaking civil each ... each other in the political atmosphere and I wonder how he thinks\nA dismissing some people's activities and wanting to dismissing yet ... how does that help having a discourse about this issue that the money that they need and other people could contribute bumped take my response off the air\nWell Jane appreciate the call and bird watching is a huge huge activity or for some folks that have some friends who are into it and it is enormous and they spend a lot of money traveling and on the fancy binoculars and so forth\nSo I get to them and die and uh and you know I I certainly wouldn't laugh it off in fact a we have a very close relationship with the department with the Audubon Society um they are under contract with us to do a lot of their of bird work because we don't have in house experts\nAnd we're also financially\nHelping to support them escaped fish waves which are are run by them a so um you know I don't know if my I got misinterpreted there or whatever but I don't have a I have no ax to grind bird watching and in fact uh I uh\nWas it was a big thing for me especially when I was a kid so uh\nWell I Wonder if your reaction was in part I'm anticipating the reaction that humid out from the\n... not not who don't want outside interest on the Amish are not the commissioners but the uh but some of the folks on the other side because that's this is exactly the fight that is that is out there\nYeah which I Am glad you called and we can uh\nGive us a chance to clear that up and I'm here's another issue that I Want to raise with you a director Norman do the big big issue New Hampshire especially over the summer um and has to do with boat launches Michael in Warner emails\nNew Hampshire does not have a readily accessible all tied boat launch on great bay what is preventing the state from improving the existing law to heal and park\nAs a New Hampshire resident and salt water angler I'm wasting time and gas to drive to Eliot or can remain each time I fish and paying those towns a twenty dollar per launch be\nMichael glad you email them let's talk about the salt water but lunch but also more broadly um you know there's been a complaint that ah somebody hamsters best lakes are kind of\nUm tied up by people who have the wealth to have a house on the lake and the rest of us kind of look at the lake and go wow that looks really nice\nYeah well what's generally say that um\nIt's all about the money okay so our boat uh we're part of the access program or are we are the access program so I get five dollars from every state bowl registration\nA that goes into access which amounts than a typical year to four hundred and fifty thousand dollars or so um that's the same five dollars we got in Nineteen Ninety two when we were assigned the boat access program\nWeight Nineteen Ninety two was a long time ago [laughter] half a million and\nBought a lot more than a half a million today right ah in addition to that we get a some money from a from the former mentioned are dangled Johnson federal grants there's a piece of that\nThe state money to match um altogether the access program has about a um you", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "18"}
