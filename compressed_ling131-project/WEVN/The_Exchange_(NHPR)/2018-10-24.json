N. H. pulled the St ... as well it came at a couple of days really indicated the same thing Ninety percent of Democrats said they were likely to vote very likely to vote a but guess what same amount for Republicans so\nThat gap we saw almost all year and it was definitely a highlighted in the primary seems to be disappearing whether it's cabin or other examples or maybe just Republicans waking up and realizing that the midterms are just two weeks away\nIt seems like the enthusiasm gap is definitely narrowed so we are talking about a midterm here though we know historically turnout in midterms can be somewhere in the thirties mid thirties um I've seen as low as ... I think two thousand and fourteen it with something like thirty three percent support what are your expectations though for for over all turn out in the ground is much higher this time around and the predictions are are are going to be maybe one of the highest\nA turnout since two thousand and ten or maybe a two thousand and six which were both\nYears we know that the Democrats and then the Republicans that extreme we'll waive years in for either Chris er and and what do you think is driving that is this about this is really about Trump or is this something specific to New Hampshire do you think\nI I think that it is a reflection of the trend you're seeing nationally um I think you know just as you saw you know women's march in in DC that after the inauguration there were a lot of marches and protests and that sort of thing here and so I think\nThat that same national phenomenon is what's happening here in New Hampshire\nSo these midterm elections actually and it seemed to be a little bit nationalized in some respects I I'm a believer that the that were also in ensconced in social media now that everybody just kind of getting cranked up by what they're reading on a daily basis on their their Twitter feed their Facebook page\nI think we can't discount the role that social media has had\nIt was obviously clear and the last elections we've and of course there's now lots of allegations that social media wasn't is used and there was Russian interference but\nThat's going to affect us just as much in the midterms be as as you said it's also what you see your friends posting on what other political parties are paying for ads you know digital ad spending is definitely something I'm noticing this year a lot in campaign finance reports\nSo I Would say but I Will also say that the other thing is on there are a couple of New Hampshire specific issues that I think people are getting really fired up about any family medical leave I Know we're going to touch on some of the Arab states\nSome states actors and speaking of social media I think it's made it possible for everyone with even a passing interest in politics to treat every single you know state legislative special election in Wisconsin or a special election for the house in Pennsylvania or Ohio becomes a national event\nGot social media is the great nationalized or I think ... it seems like it's going to everybody wound up and you know maybe that will have a positive effect on turnout but I think it also adds to kind of the intensity uh and I decided a lot of people have about voting okay let's turn to the uh let's turn to the governor's race specifically and Paul let me\nTurn to you first I'm interested in each of you here in kind of a thirty second or minutes snap shot on where you think that governor's race is a right now\nWell let's start with the polls are both to polls we've been talking about the un agency announced lumped they'll they indicate the person who is winning by either ten or eleven points with two weeks ago ...\nThat's the kind of a healthy margin right there it's it's outside of the sampling error freebie either pole ah I thought the other striking numbers from the polls were Molly Kelly is running for statewide office with two weeks to go\nForty two percent a of those who question in the ... did not know enough about or to form an opinion and forty eight percent of the un HBO that's kind of high with just a\n... year at this point in the campaign or the other thing that struck me was I covered the first debate or the other day which was down to Nashville the chamber of commerce\nYou name the issue they disagree taxes minimum wage workforce development famously commuter rail voter laws energy bills gun safety laws marijuana legislation and public financing of elections that was the only thing that they agreed on other than that these two people are widely apart when it comes to the issues ... ...\nYeah and I think that the other thing that you know you talked about name recognition and that's huge we saw that was a real struggle for in a combat after and twenty sixteen and it is a little surprising considering that she did serve in state office before but the other thing that I Will face and you know also have the benefit of much larger fundraising numbers\nSo there was a lot of news that said okay since the primary she's raised more than ... and that's absolutely true\nBut he's still got about half a million dollars on her yelled out center by about a hundred thousand dollars and\nIn his last reporting period itself I think that she definitely has an uphill battle but once again we've talked about those independents are wild card and if there is that democratic wave that we have been talking about for the past few months it could boost her\nYet for it yeah I I generally agree um I ... is very popular governor he's leading in polls he's not necessarily leading by as much as you'd expect given pulls out his approval up around you know in the sixties in the mid sixties he tends to be pulling around fifty percent but for Kelly\nThe issue is just a there's two weeks to go by and large chunks of the electorate just don't know who she is I don't know much about her and unless you can improve those it's really tough to see you need a very very very big blue wave that most striking to help her out without\nYeah let's so let's talk a little bit now specifically about issues and and start with the with Christian who knew and and they'll turn to you a pulse Steinhauser a what is ... ... argument or his case for reelection in terms of policy specifically\nWell he he basically touts his achievements this past two years in the corner office a takes a you know he talks about how he's repair the mental health system in this day he\nTalks about being the first governor to provide a full day kindergarten state wide so and he's got some achievements are that actually cross over and that has bipartisan appeal and he talks about them nonstop on the campaign trail\nHe also is critical of Mali Kelly when it comes to taxes uh when it comes to family leave or the family leave bill that she has been supporting and talking about non stop the the last couple of weeks\nAnd it will say one of the thing besides the issues as we've been talking about this race he's got history on his side right only one governor in the last nine years has lost re election to a second to your term you really got to do really bad job to not get reelected\nAnd a poll you mentioned the new news attack on Mali Kelly talking about a talking about the taxes and spending a let's listen to a little bit of what he said to you recently\nAnd from Massachusetts General hospital using research to develop treatments were complex conditions\nAll the help patients get back to their lives Mass General revolutionizing care mostly cloudy for today and chance of rain showers for most of the state of mix of rain and snow showers and northern parts of his New Hampshire within an inch accumulation possible eyes today in the forties [noise]\nThis is an HP are\nThis is the exchange I'm ... ... ... today the race for governor of the executive council and some other election items adventurous\nYou can send an email to exchange and engage P. R. dot org you can respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange or you can call into the exchange at one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven that's one eight hundred eight nine to an age PR I have three guests\nIn with me in Studio today a Paul Steinhauser New Hampshire political journalist\nChris Kyle eerie associate professor of political science\nAt St ... college an anti brown director of research and analysis that citizens count a non partisan nonprofit organization promoting a civic engagement and before the break we were talking about the governor's race a before we move on to the executive council we should mention that there is a libertarian candidate in the race this time daughter Jarvis\nA and let me turn to you first added to talk a little bit about how the libertarians factor into this\nShort so libertarians did get full party status this year there on the ballot and your own category and Gillette of Jarvis is in many ways sort of a lot of it is the third alternative to ... and Kelly and so for example she's in favor of marijuana legalization\nShe doesn't want any more taxes coming into the state she kind of want that hands off approach from the government\nSo I think that the interesting fact will be to see if she ...\nKnow and in the polling you know obviously she is not pulling his high nearly as high as either of them but I Do think it's possible especially in those undecided voters if they're dissatisfied with both parties as we've seen these independents that sort of backing off whereas the partisanship is getting more and more you know maybe she could pull down some of that Republican vote\nAnd Paul libertarians have their own ballot for the first time uh I think in the primary there about a thousand ballots are cast out of several hundred thousand votes you're out on the campaign trail every day a is a libertarian ... those are the candidacy of Jarvis or is that filtering into the discourse or not so much a little bit\nA little bit I I mean I'll be honest you know the Democratic and Republican nominees are dominating this race as a or they have in the past but but again you know she could definitely be a factor in swing the election one way or another if it's very close to ... uh he was the nominee last time around and twenty sixteen he won for just over four percent of the vote\nThat's that's not that's that's something to talk about that Christian in a close race could make the difference\nYeah I think a lot of people look at the Senate race in twenty sixteen and saying that race libertarian candidate and made the difference between I'm Kelly Ayotte Maggie Hassan or if you know Mali Kelly catches fire if Democrats really come home to her in the final stretch of the campaign [noise] uh you who knows libertarians could be a factor in this race as well\nSo perhaps the role of spoiler although that's not necessarily the role that they want to play I'm sure they prefer to be you know the un on alternative competitive alternative\nUh okay so let's shift gears now we're talking about the governor the other part of the gubernatorial equation there's the governor's executive council a little bit of an unusual institutional structure here in New Hampshire and a critic out there and let me turn to you first what is the executive council and why do we have it just in case listeners are not that familiar with a short\nA New Hampshire's executive council is a holdover from the colonial era I'm initially it was I Believe part of the legislature uh than during the American revolution New Hampshire wrote its own state constitution and decided to make the executive council will check on the governor\nAnd it's basically continued in that form um ever since so the executive council has to work with the governor on issues like spending issues on certain appointments they do executive branch oversight [noise] uh and it's ... it's really unusual there are very few states that still have anything like this\nUm it's also part of why so many New Hampshire governors wants to become senators because if you become a senator you don't have like a five person board of directors you have to answer to on a regular basis\nAnd we've seen in my senses in recent years this has become a little bit of a launching pad for his is arcane as it is\nA little bit of a political launching pad ... stern Chris Pappas or others where governor ... absolutely Christian into a and a ... and other executive council rooms occasionally mentioned as a future gubernatorial candidate but your sense of the council and its role\nYeah well I think that the executive council is something that most people in New Hampshire probably don't pay any attention to until there was a big issue and side said that that Planned Parenthood contract comes up whenever that kind of people say oh yeah the executive council has a big role and of course governor for governors and then when he was a counselor was considered a swing vote on that\nAlso hit the council is responsible for approving\nA pointing at court appointments cabinet or cabinet yet So Frank ... when he was confirmed as commissioner of education people thought he was perhaps had coming in with an agenda they didn't like him so that was controversial and also judges and I thought it was a little interesting because when that recent ruling came down an SBA three which was the voter\nRegistration bail on singing you said that was politically motivated\nAnd that was a judge that was appointed under governor Lynch so these things do come back around definitely don't underestimate the executive council\nYeah I think it's becoming increasingly important part of the political landscape is definitely become more political in recent years you talked about the former counselors who are now in higher officer of seek higher office also you know for somebody who covers the council meetings I remember in particular the Planned Parenthood funding the funniest\nEngland that was a huge political hot uh item and there was a lot of protests around that back in twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen and those votes and it was right front and center in the governor's race as well you know right now\nIs the council's controls three to five Republicans are and we're keeping our eyes on a number of close races uh especially the one for the district for which includes Manchester but not just Manchester a lot of towns uh this is this is Chris ... seat but he obviously is not running for re election is it going for Congress\nThis is one where a tear gas is the former mayor of Manchester former state Senate president or this is a seat they could flip from democratic control to Republican control the Democrat running in that race is also pretty well known great chatted with a a a a high tech executive\nAnd also the libertarian candidate Richard I'm also a a ... I don't know if you've been covering this particular race directly but but the energy ours are sharing gifts and reported that Ted gases or skip the chamber of commerce debate the a and a decline to Norwood debate have you heard anything out there and the stuff about whether he's engaging\nDemocrats been critical of him obviously for that and they've been pointing it out and trying to highlight that a ... to ... campaigns his own way a and a\nA ... the Democrats all the little ... on that but let's let's be honest he's got a lot of name recognition he has lost his last two elections and he he made the bit obviously for the gubernatorial nomination on the Republican side and twenty sixteen\nAnd then he lost his reelection but in twenty Seventeen for Manchester mayor but he's still very well known in that area and remember it's not just Manchester that district goes way out on the root for court or all the way to Barrington and north woods some pretty conservative areas\n[noise] we're doing a midterm election preview here on the exchange you can call in and joining the conversation at one eight hundred eight nine to\nSix or seven seven one eight hundred eight nine to an age PR you can email exchange advantage P. R. dot org you can find us on Facebook and Twitter I'm In studio with Anna brown of citizens count ... theory of St ... college and veteran New Hampshire political journalist\nPaul Steinhauser on and let me talk to you for your turn to you for your thoughts on this district for raising your sense of that race\nSure well it was really exciting race also in the primary because at great center weighs ... pounds back our Carvel\nAnd so the one thing that I've noticed is that gap that this course had that huge name recognition that he's working with but he has not been fundraising it's not just you know on the other hand she knew it had to spend a lot of that money in the primary\nSo now they're looking about even in terms of what they have less than their war chats\nSo the other thing that I Will say is interesting is that happens one about five percent by about five percent and twenty sixteen so I think that's definitely enough of a margin that you know it could flip either way I Would say once again having the libertarians and here we don't want to talk about them justice spoilers be if they do have their own issues positions that they're bringing to the table that they can change the debate\nBut I Do wonder if that could take away from ... ...\nAnd ... and let me turn to you on district a district five a a former executive ... picking the tally is getting back into a to challenge a ... a day wheeler Republican are also a libertarian candidate Brian ... what's your sense of district five\nOr this is one Democrats hope to flip a they they keep their eyes on this they tried to get wheeler out two years ago ah they\nWere successful that picking a tally is very well known down there and listen to you know she was a state senator she spent about a decade in the council a ... and she is a pretty active campaign or wheeler kind of campaigns his own way let's I'll be generous it's a quiet way of campaigning I'm ... I think this is going to be a close ... close won this district\nObviously favors ... other than national it favors Republicans when the redistricting happened at the beginning of the decade ... they shifted it a little bit to favor the Republicans\nOr Democrats this may be there one good shot at a pickup yeah enter your thoughts on district five\nYeah I think that it's once again these are both well known names in that\nThey both been going back and forth I think it's interesting because that he said we are really is a quiet campaign or you know I've I've brought up a couple of different number as a fundraising he he's he's not that big on fundraising you know he just does it he does it his own way um\nBut he did win by about nine percent twenty sixteen and that is a pretty large margin so I think that once again this might be an issue of voter turnout and you know is it the Democrats that are showing up or is it the Republican\nChris let me turn to you that ... something more general ... a question that we we had an email from a Christopher who asks about electability factor and he was talking in terms of the government the governor's race that you were talking a lot about policy but really people are just kind of making decisions based on like the ability\nRated number one hospital in New Hampshire my US News and World Report striving to get patients back lives important moment\nDartmouth Hitchcock ...\nThis is an HBO\nThis is the exchange I'm dean ... tomorrow you can hear the rebroadcast of tonight's life form with gubernatorial candidates ... new new in Mali Kelly that will be on tonight at a\nSeven pm on HBO and you can still get tickets are available for free you just go do you need to go to an itch PR a dot org slash events and you can find out about that I get more information on tonight's forum but this hour we're reviewing some of the issue is likely to come up in that form tonight but also a broader election issues involving a variety of the races here\nIn New Hampshire you can send an email to exchange advantage PR dot org\nYou can respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange and you can call in at one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven that is one eight hundred and eight nine to an H. P. R. I have three guests with me in Studio ...\nIts would say in film a pulse Steinhauser New Hampshire political journalism Anna brown director research and analysis for citizens count a nonpartisan nonprofit organization promoting civic engagement ah I Believe they also have an election ... and you're going to visit their Web page or to get more information on all the candidates\nA let's shift gears now and talk a little bit about these\nA ballot questions there are two questions\nA on a ballot a on election day of dealing with a believer in the state constitution the pretty confusing I use ... if you give me a lot of trepidation whenever I approached them and try to figure out how I'm going to vote one deals with the ability of a\nQuestion one deals with the ability of a tax payer a who's a registered voter to sue local or state governments\nOr for misuse of ... taxpayer funds and the other deals with privacy and technology on a limb and talked to turn to you and your\nSo the first one came about after a lawsuit where it was challenging I Believe it was the tax credit scholarships where businesses could get a tax credit for donating to a scholarship fund and some students and um other taxpayers tried to sue and said\nYou are violating the constitution by spending our taxpayer dollars in this way and the court instead of ruling on the constitutionality said well just because we're spending your taxpayer money doesn't mean that that's a really a harm you can demonstrate you don't really have standing to sue us so basically what this first question says is it says All right\nAnybody any taxpayer has a right to say you're spending my tax payer dollar's unconstitutionally so it's creating this broader right to sue the government the judicial branch testified against it because they were concerned that this would really increase the number of lawsuits the state was facing and they say we don't have enough\nJudges to handle this\nThey also expressed some concerns that it would give the judicial branch too much power because then basically any taxpayer could say this law is illegal it's unconstitutional challenge it and then the courts are the ones that are saying whether or not the law flies any law so on the other hand whoever it passed almost unanimously does it was very popular\nNine to Seventeen yeah Alison twenty two to two and a son\nAnd I think a lot of people look at that that case and say well yeah they should have been able to say you don't get to spend my taxpayer dollars on religious schools or whatever the issue as to you you have to follow the constitution when you're spending my dollars\nThe first one so the second one is a right to privacy so the state constitution as the federal constitution protects your belongings your person\nFrom unreasonable searches and seizures which means basically means the government needs to get a warrant if they're going to do a search\nWhen it comes to information and data it's a little more gray and the Supreme Court in the United states has had some rulings that say okay you got you got to get a warrant if you want to know someone's that you know cellphone location or if you want to put a tracker on their car\nOr whatever but there's this feeling that well what if what if the government approaches Facebook and Facebook is a private company you've given them your data voluntarily so they can do with it what they want so\nAnd this right of privacy basically says you you have to get a warrant if you want to get this private information on it was ... nail Kirk sponsored this and he has been a privacy bulldog in the state representative house of representatives\nHe's not running for re election I think this was his swan song has really happy to get this on the ballot so once again though the judge and judicial system says okay this this is going to increase the workload it's going to be really unclear for law enforcement how might this impact the private sector there and that's\nThe definition of privacy ... and challenging\nYet and I think honestly there there is just a huge question what would this ultimate impact to be I think that you would have to seek court cases to know exactly what it's protecting what you need a warrant for what you don't need a warrant for and the criticism that I've\nAnd of course this one pass the house twenty to fifty three to Ninety six and the Senate to Fifteen to nine a but it's a challenge right you need two thirds of voters in order for these to be adopted\nThat's right and I think there's enough uncertainty about these I think a lot of people uh see something with complex language that they don't necessarily understand there in the voting booth they have to get to work they have to get home to their families are and are probably going to vote no unless it's really crystal clear unless they really strongly support\nIt [noise] okay uh so I Hope the folks find that helpful it is a little bit a little a little bit confusing Paul do you want to jump\nIn ... just because I Love being on the exchange because I just got a text from Colorado string\nOr to correct something that I said because that was a little I was incorrect he points out that his political organization we were talking about how it's been fundraiser and ... exactly he says they don't raise he's not raising money specifically for candidates he's raising money for grassroots an online organizing for forums on voting rights civil engagement and ending gerrymandering so\nThat we'll have a correction and they didn't have to really well and I hope listeners as as I was saying I Hope listeners fine that discussion helpful these ballot questions\nCan be very intimidating and a a it's a way to ... in theory change the state constitution and but do you do have that very high threshold of a two thirds of voters needed\nAll the time remaining let's shift gears a little bit and talk about uh the two house races or were you and see the one uh which we know is kind of the sea coast on up into the sort of the eastern half of the state and then the CD too which is good western and up and to the north country let's start with CD one\nAnd a crust of your Congress guy so let me turn to you first uh uh we have a Republican Eddie Edwards Democrat Chris Pappas libertarian Danville forty this is the open seat from Carol Shea Porter how was just looking right now\nI say this was looking pretty good for Chris Pappas um between the combination of it looking like a good year for Democrats a pappas has represented\nMost of that district on the executive council for a number of years um he's well known because his family owns the puritan I he's raised more money than Edwards I I think he's you know of the favorite candidate in that race at this point\nWhat I'm saying is polling I think had him up I don't know if it was double digits but it was pretty ... and also the ground UNH Paul has made him and I want to know any other ... eight or nine right yeah uh so uh pull your sense of how you think this race is shaping up yeah\nI I agree with two weeks to go a path is is definitely the favorite he's got the advantage to the polls he's got the name recognition slight advantage and he's got obviously got the financial advantage what's fascinating to me is remember this is the first district is one of those high profile\nUh inexpensive congressional districts in the country swing districts but this year or the national groups are staying out of it a ... and that probably will hurt a Edwards with these final weeks to go you're not going to see a massive infusion\nAt least we haven't seen it yet from some of the superPACs that to help Edwards out in ... as you said there are staying out of it why do you think they're staying out of it well first of all the Republicans have are playing defense mostly overall in this country as they try to keep their majority in the house so that's where most of the money's going\nOh they've been looking at the polling as well and maybe they feel like it's not worth an infusion in this race I don't know if that's the actual case but maybe [laughter] yeah and ... cents on CD one\nWell I think that honestly Edwards is struggling with name recognition I think that you know obviously there is she positions are really important but I think still if you just ask someone that you know do you have Chris pop it they'll they'll know the name and it makes a difference and I will also say that the other thing that I think is interesting that Pakistan is he does appeal to some Republicans he\nHe had that business savvy which I think people appreciate and also I think that you've you've seen that I remember on the Republican Party came out with the criticism saying that\nYou know he didn't tell him that his he inherited and then you had Republican failed him coming out and saying no no no don't do that you know you can't be can cheat critiquing someone's getting his background so I think that's his other strength as he does have\nRegardless who wins we're going to have history obviously right Chris Pappas will be the first openly gay member of Congress from New Hampshire and if Edwards when he'll be the first African American member of Congress from the state of New Hampshire a Christian a little bit more about\nThe the first CD we know it's a swing district it's kind of\nYou can you can track I think Carol Shea Porter wanted oh six and a wait and then\nGet into it was in ten and then a a huge Shea Porter came back in and twelve and then Franken was in fourteen I think I got it right every now and I don't want to see if I can pull that off but why why is it such a string distributing Trump won by a few\nPoints yeah um it's a swing districts because it's a district that it you know there there's not a preponderance of the population for one party or the other so you know it's a lot of it just comes down to who who's voting who's surging on election day is this a democratic year as a Republican year [noise]\nUh and you know the first district is very swinging but its wings with the rest of the country you know in years when Democrats are winning seats the first district tends to go blue in years where the Republicans are picking of house seats tends to go read\nW.

I think a lot of folks do I do a lot with kids are so issues whether it's in schools early childhood education the D.C why of crisis that we inherited the mental health crisis\nThat we inherited we've been able to really challenge ourselves to build on those those structures if you will\nAnd it's not just what you get done it's how you do it right it's how you work across the aisle how your cordial how you invite stakeholders to the table and all these issues that really defines a lot of our success and\nAgain you know you can't let the negativity of Washington to find a how we're going to do it here we become that gold standard we've stood out and because we work together we've been able to get things done from New Hampshire so it's an exciting time lot more work to do um uh but again we we've got the right teams in place and we're excited to move forward\nThinking governance new let's get into our questions and the orders questioning was decided by an earlier coin toss evidence new a new one that coin toss it will turn to you first and let's start with our voting system\nA judge this week block the use of a new voting law called S. B. three saying that instead of combating voter fraud the law imposed an additional burdens he said on legitimate voters\nGovernor you said this ruling was politically motivated what do you mean by that\nWell I mean that is is it a coincidence that the ruling came out two weeks before the election [laughter] it's pretty obvious\nSo let's understand well let's be three is it simply says that anyone can go up and vote 'em if you have an id great if you don't you still get to vote no one gets turned away from the polls and we simply asked that within thirty days that's a long period of time you come back and show your proof of of being ... or a resident of the state it's it's actually quite simple\nSo um I think those are the attorney general or they're going to look through two pathways again you got to get through the political aspects of this and just make sure that we have integrity in our system we're the first in the nation primary you have\nTo have integrity we've had loopholes in our system which is why\nWhen bill twelve sixty four came forward I said boy I I hate that bill because I'm a nervous it could unconstitutionally suppress the vote so what did I Do as governor I did exactly what you should do we sent it to the Supreme Court\nAnd the Supreme Court came back unanimously the three judges that'll pond on it said unanimously not only was it constitutional but it was in New Hampshire interest because we're the only state when the only state from the country where you don't have to be a fulltime resident so it's just putting us on park the end of the Davis all has to be about fairness and equality\nWell the governor had lots that excuse me the judge had lots of concerns are long lines at polling place if you said certain groups um including minorities and students and people who are homeless and he was afraid they might feel depressed from voting so you're not hearing those concerns\nWell that doesn't make sense as first as always long lines of polling places I don't know how this would make it longer in fact we're providing flexibility so if you don't have your ID you can come back at a later time so it doesn't really make sense\nCenter Kelly to you a different building question the attorney general's office has recently charge several voters with fraud those cases have not yet been prosecuted still given that these cases do exist how open argue to any changes to voter eligibility or registration\nWell you know I just do want to back up just for a minute on that question into a ... to relate to the two bills that\nWere uh before at the legislators today or this year and came to the attention of our governor which was that the three and then in the house bill as well I Would have a veto and both of those bills you know I've spent a lifetime breaking down barriers are making sure that people can vote within a democracy\nOr the state of New Hampshire has an excellent read\nThat ah there is no fraud and there have been maybe one or two instances but we have had very very limited at any uh really accusations and founding on that you know in fact what the superior court in their injunction to stop at the three one of the things they\nThey actually had his burden them uh it's irresponsible and it's discriminatory in particular to discriminated and targeted are college students which is ... which is unacceptable\nUm so I think that when you balance uh maybe an incident maybe two incidents of what the court really said was it's not enough\nAh to a a bird and the rest of the voters and as you said long lines and\nSo to my question center Kelly and just thirty seconds please so any changes um do you think that need to be made to voter eligibility registration\nWell stamp out possible ... no I think I think the laws that we've had a New Hampshire are absolutely up have worked and as the court had said we are going to go back to where we were before age before the house failed in the Senate bill go back to ... as we have always a\nA defined it and continue to move forward that way and that will be in effect for this for this election as well and I think people need to understand that we are going back to our definition that we were and have worked here in the state\nOkay thank you both and Josh next question comes from you\nOr we're going to turn to taxes or senator color you close to veto sales or income tax something you never did until running for governor you also say you'd preserve the original reduction to the business enterprises charts but would like to reverse cuts made to the business profit starts\nMy understands you also want to legalize and tax marijuana so are those changes on a business profit search and taxing marijuana you only tax changes your envisioning or you know as as in the past two or more options on the table for you\nYet just thank you for that question I yes I have been absolutely clear that I Do not support and that I wouldn't veto and sales or an income tax um and I've been very clear about that and in the Senate I did a vote to cut taxes for\nA a small businesses entrepreneur and also um start ups have which I Would continue to do and support as governor\nBut I've been with us or are you in vision of a need for other revenue I mean you're talking about spending so you you believe simply taxing marijuana once it's legalized right and reversing the customers would probably start you know\nWe have a we have a twelve billion dollar budget and I believe that we can be responsible to address the issues are here in our state and as I said before a I Am not going to support 'em or a support a sales earned income tax and I would be to above\nOkay I've got a different tax question for you know you're talking about taking the free market approach and you said the government should pick winners and losers correct or absolute okay so um how does that square with your support for built to exempt companies involved in Oregon for generations from business taxes for ten years\nAnd from New Hampshire school administrators association representing school superintendent and administrators championing the education of children every day and age S. A. and taught or\nThis was an age PR\n\nWelcome back to our candidate forum for New Hampshire governor I'm Laurie can only along with Josh Rogers this hour we're ... we're talking with the Republican and democratic nominees Governor Crist new new and former state senator Molly Kelly were coming to live from Manchester community college and let's jump right back into our topics and Josh you get the next question\nOr aren't you Laura center tell you folks to great great deal on family leave and one of those besides a policy or what specific items do you have on your agenda that would improve the lives of the struggling families you talk about for going in the campaign trail please be specific and say how you pay for sure\nWell thank you thank you jobs and as I said earlier in our discussion you know that uh\nI I understand the challenges that working family a faith because I have lived them and yes I Do support the paid family medical leave act I think uh uh the people here in New Hampshire want a a paid family medical leave act and and you know that what it is is that people\nShould be able to be with the people that care the most about when those people need them as well\nUm you know I Know that my opponent had an opportunity to pass a paid family medical leave act out just this last year did not and later called it a vacation it's not a vacation it is about taking care of and caring for our newborns it's about being with her elderly parents when they're ill\nAh it's about being with uh children when they need you or making that decision terrible to have to make a choice about doing that or maybe losing your job not being able to pay your mortgage your rent or to teach your children\nAre so I feel that uh uh I understand that challenge and uh I Will make paid family medical leave\n'em a reality I think the other uh that I Would like to do to improve people's lives one is that we do need to move forward to a livable wage uh I hear people every day in particular families who are really frustrated because affordable\nHousing is out of reach for them they cannot find affordable housing and property taxes taxes to continue to go up um so we do we do need to move\nOh I'm you know we talked about the same schools and improve the lives of all of our families in our area and I have pushed forward for renewable energy in our state I did that when I was in the Senate put forth the first a renewable\nEnergy and they'll have a good ... meter and a half by going over my time and how you're pointing to me not looking at the clock acting\nThat's where we go marine usually goes governor dumb to you on on family leave when you ran last time you said you were interested in having a paid family leave program\nBut you know as we know is governor you ended up having reservations about the bill that are clear the house so you cited physical concerns over solvency but you never rolled out a policy of your own now you say you want to play on that could be voluntary it operates in the private market um\nSo we're already hearing what you paid family medical leave\nAnd this was a case where the Democrats took a good idea and twisted it into an effective income tax essentially destroying the possibility of moving forward so badly that are commissioner of employment security stood up the commissioner of insurance stood up and said we can't this could go bankrupt who can't vote shirts financial solvency imagine a governor supporting a plan\nWhere people are paying into a system that could go bankrupt so when you have to drive down the benefits they're not there anymore\nRight my plan is actually quite simple we bring the private sector in my plan includes state employees her plan does not my plan has no start up costs no operational costs 'cause we bring the private sector and her plan has nearly twenty million dollars just to get the thing up and running\nAnd most importantly my plan brings companies the majority of companies in the states that are fifty employees and less now getting included her plan does not include that so by bringing coup challenging is your plan\nBecause that's exactly it so you bring in third party insurers right almost like um like we do not like a almost like an Affleck I don't want to name companies necessarily but almost like they do as a supplemental insurance you provide that supplemental insurance for the state employees what you're getting her plane didn't include a very large employment pool\nThe rates go very low and you can share those rates out into the private market they bear the cost of running the system in the operational costs we get the benefits of letting anybody choose and unlike her\nPlan where once you um I mean this was a plan where if you didn't certify having no public notary certify a piece of paper within six days you were stuck in the program and you couldn't get out\nMy program works like traditional insurance you can go in and out just like on a yearly joint will just trying to require bill that your office will be back here yes absolutely look when their plans failed and we looked at amendments Elyn Olbermann we tried to do it in a similar way but we kept working at it just because it failed we kept working at at heart\nAnd we kept moving forward and over the past four or five months we've been able to engage providers engage the system and it's a plant where again the commissioners the experts have said this will work with and we never actually from Europe's never propose it will be absolutely be proposed in the next ... during the day last year or no because again no one has ever done anything like this\nThis is a whole new way of doing it which is very exciting we can become that gold standard and then again it takes the burden off taxpayers inlaws everybody down to twenty employees to her plane doesn't do that\nBusiness is down to twenty if we can all participate in it and that's the majority of companies in the state senator and the response\nBut you know it's interesting um when I hear my opponent talk about his plan or he was obviously the governor when that was that\nHad a being that it and it would have to the house three times three times in the house\nUm he had a majority of his own party in the house and the Senate if he wanted to put through a paid family medical leave act that was the time to do it he didn't do it he had an opportunity to do it and later called it a vacation time as governor will ensure that we do pass\nCreated in ... I think it's only fair coming soon to give you thirty seconds to respond to let her clinic and I went on to our member station ... it's not a vacation must be very ... it's obviously\nYou should of course is not a vacation that's that's silly\nI'm at the end of the day when their plan we realized it was a trap of an income tax we try to the ... over a minute we tried to support that that didn't get past I don't control the whole house and would love to have gotten that done but in not getting it done it's allowed us to go back to the drawing table and create a whole new system and something that has never been done before that should be very exciting for folks\nThat broader that doesn't have the burdens of costs that includes more people are and that is truly financially viable in solving for those who would pay into it\nAll right that's a big issue in this campaign and I'm sure we'll hear more about that as the election gets closer and Josh our next question is also from you go ahead or will stick\nWith the mechanics of working with the legislature a governor you said you don't think like a legislature and you know it could be argue that it shows a near record high profile policies you've asked lawmakers to back right to work education savings accounts Murphy's law the Internet sales tax fix\nFailed and that was despite your strong public support\nAnd the legislature and two hundred and fifty and alleged allegedly did pass okay but I mean these are not to be the ones who got out there on I mean you know you didn't wind up there and everything\nWhen you believe passionately about something I Will fight for every single issue even if I think it's an uphill battle even though I think it can't be one you gotta put what you you got to believe and what you believe and fight hard for it when you brought up martial law right when it came to the issues of assault\nAnd abused women I stood right they're side by side with Bob ... we knew was taught battle bomb had lost his daughter brutally raped and murdered was terrible and we stood out I was the state leader on it my opponent sat silent said nothing\nThat's shameful frankly and that that hurt so to be out there fighting for something you believe in is very important even if you think you can't get past in the legislature 'cause you're gonna come back\nTo why he couldn't find them again why couldn't these things get passed that's that's what the question is what should the public because they know everything you and you're asking me why every issue I Believe in didn't get to know about that she said we're out front on and yeah and a war because of the legislature votes\nNot me I didn't I didn't get your vote on family medical leave I didn't get your vote right to work or nurses are these issues they never actually got to my desk so you're passionate you work with the committees you go out there you testify you work with advocates\nI mean that's how it gets done not everything is going to be a ... year complaining 'cause I didn't have a hundred percent success rate but I have gotten married and I just ... done\nIn this administration than any governor in Twenty years any governor in Twenty years go look at the record it's absolutely their child welfare reform mental health reform what we're doing at the opioid crisis is what we've done with business taxes and the economy I mean\nI think that's all you have a follow up\nI don't follow up on your on your advocacy style and that's on the way for a bill I mean you said\nCompanies that were going to try to force businesses are here to collect taxes would be in for the fight of their life yeah you've called this special session with ... along with the legislative leaders went on special session was taking place you are to Republican Governors Association meeting in Colorado that bill failed you said we're going to keep on fighting and like you know\nLook what Bill passed through the Senate unanimously if I ever you're right\nBecause if I ever thought in a hundred years that the Democrats the majority of Democrats would stand up and kill the bill for political reasons essentially putting the burden of small businesses to have to pay other state sales tax you're right I was shocked at that I think we were all shocked that that they were celebrating in the halls afterwards\nAnd again that's not that that was politics and who suffered small businesses across the state you're right I never in a hundred years thought that that happened to pass you naturally in the Senate\nThey I think the house has to take it up again my again my opponent has never given a single detail I'd love to know what the details of her playing in the ... issue might be but we put something forward we were national leaders on it again it didn't get done in the house I Can't control every single vote but we're going to keep going after that is what you do\nAnd from ... brands and photos of love from one from the parent family of the southern Barone valley you have a a little like New Hampshire state liquor stores on the Web ad Rhone dot net\nThis is an HBO\n\nWelcome back to our candidate form with the Republican and democratic nominees for New Hampshire governor I'm nor can only along with any PR senior political reporter Josh Rogers were coming to you live from Manchester community college and in addition to listening tonight you can also watch us on Facebook Live Josh the next question comes from you please\nLet's talk about education funding is you both know the states required to front a hundred percent of a quote adequate education but if you look at the numbers the money raised by the state of miles for about twenty percent of what education actually cost does this didn't need to pay more and I'll go to you for governor\nWell I'm a big believer that um the control of the the funding of education really needs to live with a legislature a hundred percent after those lawsuits in the clear my lawsuits especially of the court's dictating the formula right or you had donor towns and receiver towns the form of sometimes work to change the formula\nBut we were in the process we've removed what is essentially the most um parliamentary bought the most representative body in the world for underrepresented for a million people that's the voice of the\nPeople they should have the power of the purse in determining a you know we're funds might need to be a look at X journal variables that might not show up in a formula right maybe a business moves from one town to another or business comes into a town\nOr town's property taxes move for a certain reason but the legislature look at all those variables to make the decision of where the funding needs to go it's it's ensuring that the people have the final say\nSo you said you'd support a constitutional amendment to essentially let the legislature decided\nI'm ... I mean the whole point of having such a representative legislature why would we I mean right now we have a sense\nLike judges dictate our our education funding is decided\nBut so do you see any role for judges and the courts to guarantee protections for for individuals\nI think the constitution needs to guarantee those protections yes\nSo you don't think that if an individual you're\nAn individual judge making a determination how on a single formula how every town is going to be funded and I I don't think anybody agrees that that makes logical sense\nSo you don't think of the course of any role when it comes to education for\nAn insurance no well she could ensuring that the constitution is upheld and again I'm you know we talked about advocacy and cherish and all that I Would love to see a constitutional amendment that ensures that the legislature has the power of the purse so communities and people have the the real voice\nBecause sooner Charles or turn to you um you know the states picking a twenty percent of what district starts we pay to educate children do you think that needs to change\nI I think that uh and it it has been for me in the Senate and it will be as governor then education with it's my priority and we do need to fund education a as a priority\n'em and you know a couple of things come to mind right away as I heard my point and say we have more money than we know what to do to do with a you know in my budget my budget and like all of us when we make a budget we put at the top what's most important to have a education will be at the top and a\nAnd I think that we do have to increase the funding on education I Would not I would not ever support and I would veto any school voucher program that took money from public education and moved it to private and religious school which we can\nPublic education and raises our property taxes as governor I went to strengthen our public education and certainly not raise property taxes we ... we looked at us or I was gonna say we also\nUm my opponent has a\nA giving tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations reprinted the wealthiest corporations uh and uh\nUh here we are at a point where what we need as an educated in a prepared workforce our businesses are crying out for it or young people are leaving our state because they don't think there are opportunities we need to invest money and the funding instead of the tax breaks into education into job training and to make college affordable\nAnd we'll go to you for sort of you know so I can go to clarify your tuition costs just run because as a senator you voted for a constitutional amendment that would have limited the state's responsibility that of course we get fifty percent do still believe\nThat the amendment that I support it in the intent of that amendment or what to make sure that the communities who needed a at the funding them both received the funding and it did not reveal remove the courts\nGovernor so I I I Want to address the issue of or the the school choice yeah thirty second oh no let's be very clear the school choice school choices on public versus private school choice is allowing a student in the public schools in our public schools are phenomenal I'm a first governor twenty five years to come up to New Hampshire public schools they're phenomenal but they don't work for everybody\nAnd the bill that we looked at provide an opportunity equal opportunity on the same principle of wife fought so hard for kindergarten to make sure that low income families only those at the poverty line and below had the same opportunity to use a small portion of funds\nTo to allow their child to go somewhere and we we kept the liability on each town and we made sure that again even her on her own to attack ad or get another attack ad for my opponent\nSays a knowledge is it's less than one percent of our budget spending less than one percent of the budget to provide an opportunity for kids were the four walls of the classroom don't work is a tremendous opportunity for them as individuals and by the way it allows my bill a lot of the local money to stay in the school\nBut dollars per child went up in every school because the local money stayed even though the child had another option to go somewhere else it was a great time and unfortunate politics and bureaucracy took over and and in the\nThat will come back if you ... ...\nKnow why because it helps the most needy and provide equal opportunity for those that don't have other opportunities out there\nAll right I Want to move on to energy and climate we've got lots of questions about this from our listeners this when it comes from a listener Gerald who says\nClimate change is happening faster than projected and brings with it huge economic consequences Gerald says what should our governor do to address it Joe thanks for the question and Senator Kelly you first what is the state's role if any in helping communities deal with climate change\nWhat climate change is real or it is real and we need to act urgency urgently on this uh\nOn climate change and you know we also know that climate change is caused by human behavior uh my opponent has real doubts about that and doubts about uh the reality of climate change as governor\nAs governor I Would put forth a an energy policy that is based on science and is based on fact\nUm and I would move our state away from fossil fuel towards a more to a renewable energy and you know I Know how to do that I did it when I was in the Senate we talked about that a little bit earlier um New Hampshire prides itself\nOn the environment we know that uh\nUh all of its here uh want to continue an environment that provide clean air clean water up for all of all of our uh the people who live here in New Hampshire so yes I have been progressive and moving forward addressing the issues of climate change and we need to be able to to continue sitting governors\nAnd they'll give you talk about what she would have contributed to come to climate change what her first assessment of music it's completely unfair I'm an environmental engineer that's what I did for a living the care of the environment and clean drinking water cleaning up hazardous waste sites that is what I spent my career doing\nSo again when you look at issues are that can affect the state were incredibly responsible state when it comes to the environment we have some of the cleanest air in the world right here\nI spent again my career cleaning up groundwater has contaminants out of groundwater which is why when we have a problem with ground water which we do in the states we're putting two hundred and Seventy five million dollar to clean drinking water infrastructure were making the biggest investment ever when they threatened to drill off of our coasted I pick up the phone no I got on a plane and I flew down\nAnd I sat with secretary Zinke ... and I got a commitment there won't be drilling for oil off the New Hampshire coast\nSo when there were issues to beer we move forward on them when you look at the Paris climate accord you know we have some stricter standards in the Paris climate accord even calls for\nShow our students taking these issues incredibly seriously we're moving forward and everybody should be very probably live in a place where the environment is so cherish\nWell let's turn back to the idea of fossil fuels and I'll give you thirty seconds I'm sort of Kelly and then go to send you thirty seconds as well\nBecause it's new expressed concern earlier that um alternative energy projects such as the ones that you promote um will cost low income grant theaters more money that we need to be careful when we move away from fossil fuels because there could be an expense for struggling families so I Wonder\nHow you move from fossil fuels to some of these alternatives in um a cost effective way\nI disagree with that uh you know my experience with the group net metering in the renewable energy bill that that pass\n'em and that was then detailed for an expansion I traveled to state and talked to many of communities that actually had put forward\nPut forth a solar hydro for example and that's what they own their own hydro plant and they now are devastated that they can't move forward because the veto of my opponent if they had been able to move forward they would have been producing clean energy\nAnd being able to supply that energy to their town meetings and to their town building some sorry and to their schools which would have lowered property taxes so they see the incentives ads really very much lowering so let me just just to have I have one thing I I Know that and yeah um but but fairness and and\nI have not I have not contributed not received one dollar from ... from any corporations are in this campaign however my opponent has received over forty percent this we'll get to the point about costs forty percent up his contributions", "year":
