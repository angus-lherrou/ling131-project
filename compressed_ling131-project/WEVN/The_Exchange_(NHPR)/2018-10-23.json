H.

P. R. dot org what's your perspective on this issue give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven again that email exchange and H. P. R. dot org you can respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange we have\nGuest in Studio ... is here program director at Phoenix house in Keene which provide alcohol addiction treatment\nCounselor with expertise in substance use and mental health disorders ... thank you for coming in thanks for inviting me also with us on a ... Stanley Smith she's substance misuse prevention coordinator for the capital area public health network initiative a granite United Way and I think it's nice to meet you thank you for being here thank you so much for having me\nAlso with us Timothy work former chair of the governor's commission on alcohol and other drugs director of New Hampshire tomorrow at the charitable foundation and\nTim a big welcome back always good to see in the morning Laura thanks well\nTim how you react to this World Health organization study that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption that's uh\nI think that it validates what we have certainly seen in the healthcare system alcohol misuse is often\nHidden in terms of its impact because where alcohol is most implicated is in other diseases that people get\nSo alcohol is highly correlate overconsumption of alcohol is highly correlated to cardiovascular disease and cancers injuries both intentional an unintentional\nUm the report notes that one in ten people's death is attributable to their alcohol use buffalo and it is a lot and I think it's also a wake up call that reminds us that alcohol is a drug sometimes we talk about alcohol and other drugs or we talk about drugs and alcohol\nBut alcohol is a drug and it like other drugs has negative health consequences if over used or misused improperly well\nTim that message though no level of alcohol is safe mean for a long time we've been told to moderate its two biggest statement you know no level is safe might some people just listen to that and say forget it you know just sort of shut their brains off it's too much\nI think that's possible but I also think it allows us not pretend you have a honest conversation that alcohol is inherently risky um I think that sometimes whether it's alcohol or in other types of drugs we talk about degrees of safety everybody particularly in the opioid epidemic you hear a lot of conversations about\nOther drugs which potentially aren't as harmful as opioids and again I think we ... this reminds us that we have a substance abuse problem we need to be aware of their isn't these substances are not safe\nUm I Do think you know will it create a wave of change in terms of restricting alcohol availability or change people's behavior is if they are what we would call sort of casual infrequent drinkers\nProbably not and I but I think that's something that the public health system has to grapple with but this at least gives us some data to have a more authentic conversation about the inherent risks associated with alcohol and\nWhat do you think I think that um like Tim was saying there's a lot of people in New Hampshire who don't necessarily understand the risks in substances that are widely available there's a lot of access to alcohol and New Hampshire\nOn but we also also see a lot of deaths because of that the New Hampshire medical examiner or released a report that showed that there are actually more deaths\nThat are alcohol related than all other drug desk combined so when we were looking about talking about the opioid epidemic or the addiction crisis that New Hampshire and is in that is really a big piece that we have to look at we have to look at alcohol because it is a contributor to death to say that again because that's significant\nSo the New Hampshire medical examiner released a report and I apologize you don't have the date but uh it was the former medical examiner and that report showed that more people are dying from alcohol related deaths and then are dying from all other drug that's combine so that's including fat no deaths including heroin overdose as\nSo all of those other debts are significant and they should be looked at and we should look at preventing those death but we also need to look at the whole picture and ... a part of that whole picture is alcohol alcohol is a significant factor so\nYou know I cover these issues all the time and I was unaware of what you just said that it's so big um how how does it do you think most granted staters are of that um that problem\nI think that I'm In this is a hard message to get out in general talking about substance use there's a lot of stigma around it so talking about something that's kind of normal we there's a lot of social norms around alcohol use\nThat says it's appropriate and it's okay um but you know I think what's significant about that report is that we really need to check ourselves and look at is it okay is there an appropriate amount um especially when we're talking about youth youth and that's really specific to my work\nIs looking at you use of substances and we know for their brain that it's never appropriate that it can significantly change their neural pathways\nAnd the pathway of the rest of their life\nYou from alcohol use well I definitely want to ask you a little bit later about some of the work that you're doing with youth um and that brain development so forth but I'm I'm only to bring you in again you're brought thoughts on this idea that\nYou know the alcohol as we're hearing from Tim and ... had a lot of dangers but it's also sort of a social norm I just wonder how you sort of interpret that\nWell from the treatment side I think it makes it difficult because people wait a long time before they actually ask for help and usually it's not the individual themselves asking for help but some external whether it's family employer\nSomething else that saying you need to go we've reached the end of what we can tolerate and um\nYou know the the glamour as Asia and all this stuff that we see out there that makes it seem like it's a good thing to do certainly is counterproductive to what we're saying which is that it is a drug and it's it's extremely potent and it's extremely available\nSo at Phoenix house half of our admissions approximately it's forty five percent to be exact and the last two years have been alcohol diagnosis substance use disorder alcohol use severe\nSo that's admission to residential treatment which is the highest level of care toward fad right by the time you get to write so and and you know the age\nSpread is definitely older than the opioid admissions but there's a a great number of young people that are abusing and misusing alcohol\nAnd they also often think well if I give up the opioid than I can drink that will be my safety and um\nIt's so not true and there are many people have had a dual addiction so they've given up the opioid and then they become addicted to alcohol\nAnd it create havoc in their bodies so as timid said earlier\nThat they have lots of physical issues related to their alcohol use that you don't see with opioids at all I mean it really you know they have this ... they have in a liver disease they have lots of issues at us and it can happen fairly young I mean it's not a given but it's certainly prevalent\nI'm really struck by what you say that almost half of your admissions are due to alcohol and again I think a lot of listeners would say whoa I thought opioids was a big deal right\nWhich is why I think it's really great that you've brought this topic to the fore because it's really important that we speak of it because it is prevalent to the same extent if not more than opioids\nWell and speaking of liver disease I'm data from the Centers for Disease Control recently showed that deaths from liver related illnesses have increased dramatically and mortality in young people\nRose the fast is this is from the CDC the rise among young Americans was caused by alcohol consumption the number of twenty five to thirty four year old so young adults who died annually from alcohol related liver disease nearly tripled\nBetween Nineteen Ninety nine and twenty sixteen an average annual increase around ten percent you have to drink a lot of family right to get liver disease I mean that's not just a beer every night right\nI mean you have to consume ... everyone is different and I couldn't give you the exact amounts sure but if you look at what the prior studies would say was a safe amount to consume it's it's really very little and people drank much more than that who don't think they are misusing alcohol at all and the first place\nAnd if you look at the college campuses across this country\nIt's really frightening how much alcohol use goes on and I look at our little town of teen and how many bars do we have in that town and it's just such a socially accepted way to get out and meet people and so\nAnd from an selling Anderson trust in the state attorneys in Bedford pleased to announce that attorney west Davis has joined the for him as an associate\nOn the Web at a an S. E. L. L. P.

H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange again the email is exchange and H. P. R. dot org or you can give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven with me in Studio ... program director at Phoenix house in Keene which provides\nAlcohol addiction treatment and other types of treatment also with us Timothy work former chair of the governor's commission on alcohol and other drugs and director of New Hampshire tomorrow at the charitable foundation and Stanley Smith substance misuse prevention coordinator for the capital area public health network\nAgain you can join us by email exchange at and H. P. R. dot org and all of you looking at state policy Cynthia sends us an email she says I have to say I work at one of the New Hampshire liquor stores and I have seen young local residents in walking distance of the store\nComing in getting their rations of nips with any type of money that could get like asking people for money just to get a single nip Cynthia says I've seen abusive the law enforcement for example police pulling up to the front door the liquor store dropping off a drunk from being in a holding cell\nI'm I'm not sure he wants to jump in on this I'm Tim maybe you I actually saw a couple people recently at the state liquor store I'm buying nips pulling change out of their pockets they clearly looked like they were they were homeless living behind a one of the grocery stores here in in a ...\nYeah so you know I think again ... illegal substance for adults\nAnd so one of the things that we work with a particularly in the prevention field with\nState liquor as well as local establishment that serves liquor is how do you do proper training so that to the extent a a a bartender or an employee recognizes that somebody may have\nA problem with alcohol or their steps you can take to try and um for for that person for help or create information of resources are available\nYou know the one thing I Will say however about and there's a lot to talk about a pack around state liquor policy is that you know we're control state that's what the term is where the state of New Hampshire it sells alcohol ... there are certain types of alcohol you cannot buy and grocery stores you can only buy them through state run liquor stores um\nThere is a significant benefit to us being in control state in that ... there what comes with being a control state is yes the retail establishment\nBut they're significant regulation behind it um and that was a result of you know going back to the days of prohibition many states opted to try and find a middle ground to make alcohol available but to try and create regulations and oversight to be as careful as possible around how alcohol is distributed in the community\nSo ... you know we don't have in New Hampshire some things that communities deal with in other states such as\nPackage stores liquor stores that pop up on street corners typically they are placed\nIn lower income uh neighborhoods so there are six and there are significant issues around compliance serving to under ... selling to under age miners things of that nature is not as tightly regulated as a ... a liquor store accept from a prevention standpoint being a being a\nControl state is a good thing\nBut I think what you're a you're a audience member is noting I think just recognizes the fact that this is a harmful substance and sometimes you can actually see that play out when you see people coming to get it\nThat's really interesting um to hear you say that it's beneficial to be a control state Tim because sometimes when we talk about alcohol on this show people call in and they say you know the state of New Hampshire is promoting alcohol look at the big ads that they have a look at the discounts um\nIt's a brings in a lot of money to the to the state budget about a hundred and fifty million was transferred to the general fund I'm from the liquor\nCommission so some people think that being controlled state it seems like the state is promoting drinking\nSo you know that's a it's it's a fair point we hear that all the time and you know I guess I personally see it as a compromise in the middle because absolutely the liquor commission advertises the liquor stores we you know a significant portion of the profits that come out of liquor sales don't come from New Hampshire residents they come from tourist who traveled to our state\nBut we don't have the kind of advertising in New Hampshire you see in other states we don't have billboards that that promote alcohol you know we don't have alcohol posters in places where kids can see them\nThere are restrictions to the types of alcohol can be sold and the types of advertising available\nThat reduce the likelihood that those ads can get exposed to young people so again it's a balance between complete prohibition um and the and other communities where it's just it's very difficult to regulate and you see real nefarious actors who are really hyper targeting populations they shouldn't be\nBecause it's more privatized and any sort of entrepreneur can settle in anywhere I remember going to New Jersey many years ago to visit family and I went to the drug store to get I don't know ... lotion something and they're really big giant bottles of gin and you know coming from New Hampshire I was like wow I can buy Jim ...\nKnow the liquor industry\nMost profits in the liquor industry are raised through the purchasing of alcohol by high level consumers\nSo most alcohol profits actually don't come from the I'm sitting having a glass of wine at dinner once a month\nThey come from high level users over users of alcohol\nSo again in our state because there are some restrictions it is an attempt by the state and the liquor commission to reduce the likelihood of the utilization of that for over purchasing can they control who comes in the door no because alcohol is a legal substance\nBut they do everything they can and again in the absence of a controlled environment we wouldn't be able to do some of those steps that were able to do here in New Hampshire\nInteresting on the go ahead so I think Tim raises a really important point about how alcohol can be advertised because we see in a lot of other states where it's advertised to use specifically and we know we want to\nDelay use use of any substance for as long as possible um New Hampshire they'll consistently ranks first or second in the nation for use alcohol use so past eight thirty use of alcohol use\nAnd we also have um [noise] the first use of a substance which is whether it's alcohol or another substance for boys in New Hampshire it's around age eleven the average age for first use and for girls it's age Thirteen and why do you define\nI'm Sorry to interrupt you but how do you define first use I mean you know if an eleven year old says dad can I have a sip your beer is that first use an eleven year old goes to middle school dance and some kids are drinking behind a school in the playground is that first youth I mean there's a big range we're talking about here so\nI Can't specifically answer how that questionnaire is written and how like the exact question I couldn't do it justice but I Believe we get that either from the CDC a wire BS survey or which is the youth risk behavior survey or it might be from the NASDAQ survey\nSo I just wanted wonder what your thoughts are about um the dangers of that first used depending on what that first uses again that fit with that at the dinner table or you don't drink the amount of middle school\nAbsolutely so it can have a couple of different um dangerous effects are harmful effects\nOne of them as we know when someone uses before the age of fourteen there four times more likely to develop a substance use disorder laugh so that and when we see our average age of first use of New Hampshire that's alarming because that means we have a you know there's the opportunity for a lot more used to develop a substance use disorder\nUm and that that uh I think you bring up a really great point about how um\n[noise] we kind of normalize alcohol at home\nAnd how we kind of a parent's maybe not in a in a a malicious or ... or vicious way might talk about alcohol and are really relaxed way and not as a harmful substance for years and we really care about use not using particularly because their brain is vulnerable\nNeural pathways are still farming and it can really have a long term effect on their brain like we've seen\nThese studies smell and I've got those why R B and numbers in front of me I'm a youth risk behavior survey as you said from the CDC and seems like there's some good news here I'm In Nineteen Ninety One\nUm eighty one percent of youth said they at least had had a they'd ever touched alcohol basically by last year twice Seventeen that was down to sixty percent so it seems like there's been a pretty big\nDrop at least according to these numbers in terms of um youth youth so\nI'm I'm only doing it jumping on well I I I was thinking about um the the sort of how many people come to us with an\nAlcohol use disorder severe who has said you know I used to sort of as of social lubricant because I was shy I mean it's it's very much a slippery slope and they can start in that way where it's it's not harmful and and and it really it's\nUm if there is a history of addiction and such you know in the family then you have more of a propensity to develop it\nAnd it's a lifelong disease and and and so I think there's that whole issue around repeating treatment episodes where people look at that and say you know what's wrong with this person can't they get it right but it really is a brain disease\nOffices and king conquered in Lebanon\nPhony with

his Democratic challenger Molly Kelly live at seven in the evening so that's all tomorrow on the exchange this hour we're looking once again at alcohol use in New Hampshire a problem often overlooked\nIn the midst of the opioid crisis but as we're hearing a lot of new research talking about some of the health dangers of alcohol join us one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven send us an email exchange\nAt an H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange one more time that number one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven and all of you I did want to ask you about some research that caught our attention concerning women and alcohol\nBunch of studies but here's just won the national Institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism um says female alcohol use disorder and the U.S increased by almost eighty four percent in the decade between two thousand two\nAnd twenty Thirteen um I'd love to hear from everybody but Tim you first what's your perspective on this pretty big rise that I'm reading about among um women and problems with alcohol\nWell I think there are a gender differences first off in terms of how I'll call impacts\nYour body and your physical functioning and we all know men can drink more than well in their shoes metabolism and things like that so even you know we we look at binge drinking high levels of alcohol use in a short period of time the number of drinks quote unquote than a man has to drink in order to be considered binge drinking is more is\nLess right side and the women is less Yankee ... so there is some inherent physical differences there I also think again alcohol use can is can be normalized can be somewhat hidden\nUm and so you have a they received seen gender differences even at the youth level around Egypt consumption an age of aunts and things like\nThat well I came across another study um and this relates to use that even among\nTeenage girls there used to be a so called gender gap um in terms of drinking\nBut now by eighth grade and girls are actually drinking more and by tenth grade it's um about equal this is also from the national Institute on drug abuse girls closing the gender gap when it comes to drinking I was frantically struck by that\nI'm more likely to drink in tenth grade than males equal when it comes to um eighth grade what do you think about\nThis I think there are potentially a lot of causes for their yeah ah so I think there's a lot going on and and for substance use in general it's never just one thing that causes substance use\nAnd so there's never just gonna be one thing that we can do to prevent it or treat it um when I think about you you specifically girl you use you know I think about the pressures that society puts on us\nAnd um you know women are less you know more likely to ask for help men are less likely um but I think women are also a less likely to you know try and\nDo you want to jump in for a less are are more likely to um weight and not cause a problem they don't want to ask for help they'd want to cause a problem that you know they they want to just try and deal with it themselves maybe but um I Would think would be more likely to ask for help they're more likely sometimes but I also think that we don't want to cause a problem of historically\nThere are more likely to speak of their mental health issue so there's a prevalence of you know depression anxiety that women come forward with and and men usually with addiction and now it's it's becoming more acceptable to say well you know I have both issues but there there's so much co occurring\nAnd it's not one thing and so I think that's that's really important in the treatment of it to address the whole bean and what's going on with their mental health because if you don't that is going to be a certain way that relapse will occur\nThat's what we've learned from this whole up your credit is is you know it's a lot of it just starts with people self medicate because of untreated mental health a lot of people looked at our you know in need of a fix mental health system and said that's what has partly causes crisis go ahead on\nAll like a few trials mature faster so they're probably realizing that the the lack of coping skills sooner than boys\nSo a lot of times when we do prevention with you for looking at coping skills for stress how to deal with stress and we know that are young girls are feeling a lot of stress I'm so making sure that those coping skills are ingrained from a very young age as early as you know first grade kindergarten\nAnd so that's something that we really want to promote is a giving access to those stresses coping mechanisms as soon as possible so I think girls are probably feeling that stress sooner than boys\nSupport for an HP our live stream

H. O. study there's been studies specific around pregnant women that there is no safe alcohol use\nSo a lot of our work has actually been working with the medical community\nTo help them understand and think about how to appropriately message because for a long time the message has been it's been one or two is not a big deal and I think we've learned otherwise\nWell and maybe a little bit later you know in this W.

really need to check ourselves and look at is it okay is there an appropriate amount um especially when we're talking about youth youth and that's really specific to my work\nIs looking at you use of substances and we know for their brain that it's never appropriate that it can significantly change their neural pathways\nAnd the pathway of the rest of their life so we want to make sure that\nUh we're protecting you from alcohol use\nWell I definitely want to ask you a little bit later about some of the work that you're doing with youth um and that brain development so forth but I'm I'm only to bring you in again you're brought thoughts on this idea that\nYou know alcohol as we're hearing from Tim and ... had a lot of dangers but it's also sort of a social norm I just wonder how you sort of interpret that well\nFrom the treatment side I think it makes it difficult because people wait a long time before they actually ask for help and usually it's not the individual themselves asking for help but some external whether it's family employer\nSomething else that saying you need to go we've reached the end of what we can tolerate and um\nYou know the the glamour as Asia and all this\nMissions approximately it's forty five percent to be exact and the last two years have been alcohol diagnosis substance use disorder alcohol use severe\nSo that's admission to residential treatment which is the highest level of care shorts bad right by the time you get to write so and and you know the age\nSpread is definitely older than the opioid admissions but there's a a great number of young people that are abusing and misusing alcohol\nAnd they also often think well if I give up the opioid than I can drink that will be my safety and um\n... it's so not true and there are many people have had a dual addiction so they've given up the opioid and then they become addicted to alcohol\nAnd it create havoc in their bodies so\nAs timid said earlier that they have lots of physical issues related to their alcohol use that you don't see with opioids at all I mean it really\nYou know they have this ... they have in a liver disease they have lots of issues at us and it can happen fairly young I mean it's not a given but it's certainly prevalent\nI'm really struck by what you say that almost half of your admissions are due to alcohol and again I think a lot of listeners would say whoa I thought opioids was the big deal right\nIs that which is why I think it's really great that you've brought this topic to the fore because it's really important that we speak of it because it is prevalent to the same extent if not more than opioids\nWell and speaking of liver disease I'm data from the Centers for Disease Control recently showed that deaths from liver related illnesses have increased dramatically and mortality in young people\nRose the fast is this is from the CDC the rise among young Americans was caused by alcohol consumption the number of twenty five to thirty four year old so young adults\nWho died annually from alcohol related liver disease nearly tripled\nBetween Nineteen Ninety nine and twenty sixteen an average annual increase around ten percent you have to drink a lot of family right to get liver disease I mean that's not just of beer every night right\nI mean you have to consume ... every one is different and I couldn't give you the exact amount for sure but if you look at what the prior studies would say was a safe amount to consume it's it's really very little and people drank much more than that who don't think they are misusing alcohol at all and the first place\nAnd if you look at the college campuses across this country\nIt's really frightening how much alcohol use goes on and I looked at our little town of teen and how many bars do we have in that town and it's just such a social you accepted way to get out and meet people and\nAnd from diversions puzzles in games committed ... fun social and technology freeways to connect at one hundred twenty three Congress reports with an diversion games dot com\nThis was on HBO [noise]\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... today gauging alcohol use in New Hampshire in light of a huge international study from the world Health Organization that said there's no safe level of alcohol consumption\nLet's hear from you send email to exchange it N. H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange again the email is exchange it N. H. P. R. dot org or you can give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven with me in Studio ... program director at Phoenix house in Keene which provides\nAlcohol addiction treatment and other types of treatment also with us Timothy worked former chair of the governor's commission on alcohol and other drugs and director of New Hampshire tomorrow at the charitable foundation and and it gets down these Smith substance misuse prevention coordinator for the capital area public health network\nAgain you can join us by email exchange at and H. P. R. dot org and all of you looking at state policy Cynthia sends us an email she says I have to say I work at one of the New Hampshire liquor stores and I have seen young local residents in walking distance of the store\nComing in getting their rations of nips with any type of money that could get like asking people for money just to get a single nip Cynthia says I've seen abusive the law enforcement for example police pulling up to the front door the liquor store dropping off a drunk from being in a holding cell to dry off overnight\nWhile Cynthia and I'm I'm not sure he wants to jump in on this I'm Tim maybe you I actually saw a couple people recently at the state liquor store I'm buying nip sort of pulling change out of their pockets they clearly looked like they were\nThey were homeless living behind a one of the grocery stores here in in a ... yeah\nSo you know I think again ... illegal substance for adults\nAnd so one of the things that we work with a particularly in the prevention field with\nState liquor as well as local establishments that serve liquor is how do you do proper training so that to the extent a a a bartender or an employee recognizes that somebody may have\nA problem with alcohol or their steps you can take to try and um preferred that person for help or create information of resources are available you know the one thing I Will say however about and there's a lot to talk about ... around state liquor policy\nIs that you know we're control state that's what the term is where the state of New Hampshire it sells alcohol you know there are certain types of I'll call you cannot buy in grocery stores you can only buy them through state run\nThere is a significant benefit to us being in control state in that ... there what comes with being a control state is yes the retail establishment\nBut they're significant regulation behind it um and that was a result of you know going back to the days of prohibition many states opted to try and find a middle ground to make alcohol available but to try and create regulations and oversight to be as careful as possible around how alcohol is distributed in the community\nSo ... you know we don't have in New Hampshire some things that communities deal with in other states such as package stores\nLiquor stores that pop up on street corners typically they are placed in lower income\nUh neighborhoods so there are ... and there are significant issues around compliance serving to underwrite selling to under age miners things of that nature is not as tightly regulated as heretics liquor store accept from a prevention standpoint being a being a control state is a good thing\nBut I think what you're a you're a audience member is noting I think just recognizes the fact that this is a harmful substance and sometimes you can actually see that play out when you see people coming to get it\nThat's really interesting um to hear you say that it's beneficial to be controlled state Tim because sometimes when we talk about alcohol on this show people call in and they say you know the state of New Hampshire is promoting alcohol look at the big ads that they have a look at the discounts um\nIt's a brings in a lot of money to the to the state budget about a hundred and fifty million was transferred to the general fund I'm from the liquor\nCommission so some people think that being controlled state it seems like the state is promoting drinking\nSo you know that's a it's it's a fair point we hear that all the time and you know I guess I personally see it as a compromise in the middle because absolutely the liquor commission advertises the liquor stores we you know a significant portion of the profits that come out of liquor sales don't come from New Hampshire residents they come from tourist who traveled to our state\nBut we don't have the kind of advertising in New Hampshire UC and other states we don't have billboards that that promote alcohol you know we don't have alcohol posters in places where kids can see them\nThere are restrictions to the types of alcohol it can be sold and the types of advertising available\nThat reduce the likelihood that those ads can get exposed to young people so again it's a balance between complete prohibition um and the and other communities where it's just it's very difficult to regulate and you see real nefarious actors who are really hyper targeting populations they shouldn't be\nBecause it's more privatized and any sort of entrepreneur can settle in anywhere I remember going to New Jersey many years ago to visit family and I went to the drug store to get I don't know ... lotion something and there was a big giant bottles of gin and you know coming from New Hampshire I was like wow I can buy gin with my band [laughter]\nWell and you know the liquor industry\nMost profits in the liquor industry are raised through the purchasing of alcohol by high level consumers\nSo most alcohol profits actually don't come from the I'm sitting having a glass of wine at dinner once a month\nThey come from high level users over users of alcohol\nSo again in our state because there are some restrictions it is an attempt by the state in the liquor commission to reduce the likelihood of the utilization of that for over purchased and can they control who comes in the door no because al ... illegal substance\nBut they do everything they can and again in the absence of a controlled environment we wouldn't be able to do some of those steps that were able to do here in New Hampshire\nInteresting and I go ahead so I think\nUh Tim raises a really important point about how alcohol can be advertised because we see in a lot of other states where it's advertised to use specifically and we know we want to delay use use of any substance for as long as possible\nLeave ranks first or second in the nation for use alcohol use so past eight thirty use of alcohol use and we also have um [noise] the first use of a substance which is whether it's alcohol or another substance for boys in New Hampshire it's around age eleven the average age for first use and for girls it's age Thirteen and why do you\nDefine I'm Sorry to interrupt you but how do you define first use I mean you know if an eleven year old says dad can I have a sip your beer is that first use an eleven year old goes to middle school dance and some kids are drinking behind the school and the playground is that first youth I mean there's a big range we're talking about here\nSo I Can't specifically answer how that questionnaire is written and how like the exact question I couldn't do it justice but I Believe we get that either from the CDC a wire BS survey or which is the youth risk behavior survey or it might be from the nets does survey\nSo I just wanted wonder what your thoughts are about um the dangers of that first used depending on what that first uses again that fit with that at the dinner table or you don't drink the amount of middle school\nAbsolutely so it can have a couple of different um dangerous effects are harmful effects\nOne of them as we know when someone uses before the age of fourteen there four times more likely to develop a substance use disorder laugh so that and when we see our average age of first use of New Hampshire that's alarming because that means we have a you know there's the opportunity for a lot more used to develop a substance use disorder\nUm and that that uh I think you bring up a really great point about how um\n[noise] we kind of normalize alcohol at home\nAnd how we kind of a parent's maybe\nNot in a in a a malicious or ... or vicious way might talk about alcohol and I really relaxed way and not as a harmful substance for years\nAnd we really care about use not using particularly because their brain is vulnerable neural pathways are still farming and it can really have a long term effect on their brain like we've seen these studies smell\nAnd I've got those why R B and numbers in front of me I'm a youth risk behavior survey as you said from the CDC and seems like there's some good news here I'm In Nineteen Ninety One\nUm eighty one percent of youth said they at least had had a they'd ever touched alcohol basically by last year twenty Seventeen that was down to sixty percent so it seems like there's been a pretty big\nDrop at least according to these numbers in terms of um youth youth so\nI'm I'm only doing it jumping on well I I I was thinking about um the the sort of how many people come to us with\nAn alcohol use disorder severe who has said you know I used it sort of as a social lubricant because I was shy I mean it's it's very much\nA slippery slope and they can start in that way where it's it's not harmful and and and it really it's that four times more likely the younger you start um if there is a history of addiction and substance you know in the family then you have more of a propensity to develop it\nAnd it's a lifelong disease and and and so I think there's\nThat whole issue around repeating treatment episodes where people look at that and say you know what's wrong with this person can't they got it right but it really is a brain disease\nHim from the lawyer referrals service of the New Hampshire bar association connecting people with experience to attorneys since Nineteen Seventy nine an H bar in ... or\nThis is an HBO ...\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... tomorrow and our show a review of the governor's race in the morning and then our foreign with Governor Sununu and his Democratic challenger Molly Kelly live at seven in the evening so that's all tomorrow on the exchange\nThis hour we're looking once again at alcohol use in New Hampshire a problem often overlooked in the midst of the opioid crisis but as we're hearing a lot of new research talking about some of the health dangers of alcohol joined us one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven send us an email exchange\nAt N. H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange warmer time that number one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven\nAnd all of you I did want to ask you about some research that caught our attention concerning women and alcohol abuse um the ... has been a bunch of studies but here's just won the national Institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism\nUm says female alcohol use disorder and the U. S. increased by almost eighty four percent in the decade between two thousand two\nAnd twenty Thirteen um I'd love to hear from everybody but Tim you first what's your perspective on this\nPretty big rise that I'm reading about among um women and problems with alcohol\nWell I think there are a gender differences first off in terms of how I'll call impacts\nYour body and your physical functioning and we all know men can drink more than well in their shoes metabolism and things like that so even you know we we look at binge drinking high levels of alcohol use in a short period of time the number of drinks quote unquote than a man has to drink in order to be considered binge drinking is more is\nLess right five ... yet and the women is less Yankee ... so there are some inherent physical differences there I also think again alcohol use can is can be normalized can be somewhat hidden um and so you\nSupport for an HP ours live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustain excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England legal challenges\nFind out how or in Reno can help you online at or dash Reno dot com\nGrade it's um about equal this is also from the national Institute on drug abuse girls closing the gender gap when it comes to drinking I was really struck by that I'm more likely to drink in tenth grade than males equal when it comes to um eighth grade what do you think about this\nI think there are potentially a lot of causes for on there yet uh so I think there's a lot going on and and for substance use in general it's never just one thing that causes substance use\nAnd so there's never going to be one thing that we can do to prevent it or treat it um when I think about you you specifically girl you use you know I think about the pressures that society puts on us\nAnd um you know women are less you know more likely to ask for help men are less likely [noise] um but I think women are also a less likely to you know try and\nDo you want to jump in for a less are are more likely to um weight and not cause a problem they don't want to ask for help but they don't want to cause a problem that you know they they want to just try and deal with it themselves maybe but um I Would think would be more likely to ask for help they're more likely sometimes but I also think that we don't want to cause a problem of historically\nThere are more likely to speak of their mental health issues so there's a prevalence of you know depression anxiety that women come forward with and and men usually with addiction and now it's it's becoming more acceptable to say well you know I have both issues but there there's so much coal occurring\nAnd it's not one thing and so I think that's that's really important in the treatment of it to address the whole bean and what's going on with their mental health because if you don't that is going to be a certain way that relapse will occur\nThat's what we've learned from this whole opioid crisis is you know it's a lot of it just starts with people self medicate him because of untreated mental health a lot of people looked at our you know in need of affects mental health system and said that's what has partly causes crisis go ahead on\nAnd they're all like the funerals mature faster so they're probably realizing that the the lack of coping skills sooner than boys\nSo a lot of times when we do prevention with you were looking at coping skills for stress how to deal with stress and we know that are young girls are feeling a lot of stress I'm so making sure that those coping skills are ingrained from a very young age as early as you know first grade kindergarten\nAnd so that's something that we really want to promote is giving access to those stresses coping mechanisms as soon as possible so I think girls are probably feeling that stress sooner than\nWell I'm again Claudia on Facebook who sent us that earlier message about the word alcoholic and how we need to not use that she also sent us some very thoughtful comments about I'm drinking and moms especially young moms and this reflects a lot of what I have seen in the literature so\nThanks again Claudia she says I witnessed the celebration and joking and a local mom group when the targeting Bedford decided to carry beer and wine rose a glorified pink drink with its sickly sweet flavor is aggressively marketed towards women promoted as a Mother's Day wind\n... says wander the whole foods in Bedford and they're pretty pink bottles of wine peppered through out the store\nWe even have yoga classes telling us to detox with yoga and then re talks with wind after awhile Claudia not heard of that\nA ... if you'd think I'm suggesting we all go to the way of tea told ... I Am not\nAll I'm suggesting is that as adults we stopped acting like we just turned Twenty one we stop having wine at play dates we adjust our attitude around alcohol and think some at what is being marketed at us ... says until we start changing this inane American cultural windy around\nConversations on drug use with our children plenty of thank you again so much and Tim I have been reading a lot about\nAlcohol mom's especially young moms women who say you know my drinking was pretty reasonable until I had little kids and then [noise] boy it was stressful boy was isolated being at home this culture for young moms today put your wind and the ... you and you know you deserve it bringing wind at the playground [laughter] what do you think of this\nSo you know I Want to add as well that you have um\nAbout ten or Fifteen Years ago there was a lot of work in the prevention field around something called Alka pops these were drinks kind of like wine coolers for folks who may remember those sort of fruit flavored alcohol drinks were aggressively marketed two girls\nAnd so to have Twenty years later a research that's suggesting an increase in the use of alcohol among women is not entirely surprising when you look at to Claudia is point the way in which alcohol in particular is aggressively marketed to target markets including women justice as Claudia described\nYou know we at the charitable foundation we're blessed with a donor who gave us a gift to do some work over a period of three years focused on women and young women particularly women who are pregnant\nAnd the other challenge with alcohol consumption is not only\nThe that kind of messaging you might see out in the community and sort of the message that might be delivered new moms in the social context\nBut there's been real inconsistency even among the medical community about what council to give women of child bearing age are on whether or not alcohol use is safe\nUm you know one you know we're we're very concerned obviously about something called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders which is a constellation of side effects of alcohol exposure in utero for a long time I think there was a belief that one drink here or there didn't make a difference\nBut similar to the W. H. O. study there's been studies specific around pregnant women that there is no safe alcohol use so a lot of our work has actually been working with the medical community\nTo help them understand and think about how to appropriately message because for a long time the message has been it's been one or two is not a big deal and I think we've learned otherwise\nWell and maybe a little bit later you know in this W. H. O. study World Health organization so the men are still likely to die from alcohol related causes by far by far by far um even though these rates among women and girls are jumping let's go back to our listeners and policy Nashua high Paul you're on the air welcome\nGood morning thank you so much for ah having this topic or a person myself I'm actually an elected county official but I'm In long term recovery from substance misuse congratulation as\nWell thank you and a central piece of um [noise] my campaign when I ran a couple of years ago was to ah hopefully reduced or removed the stigma associated with substance use disorder\nAnd that's just I'm a very difficult challenge I'm lucky 'cause I'm self employed that I'm able to you know spread the message I'm In my family is open to myself spreading the message of recovery um but it's very difficult\nFor people in the community so um you know again I appreciate your your folks talking about the subject today\nOkay thank you so much for the call do you want to jump in on um the point that he made on only\nWell I I certainly agree with him or that this the stigma around it just doesn't go away no matter how much we say let's change the language and you know you can see that reflected in the whole twelve step a community which is a huge part of recovery for many people who\nUm attend those meetings where it's it's anonymity and and that was all around our privacy laws which is the forty to see how far which is it's the most restrictive confidential law around for not revealing anything about someone's substance use disorder and it was", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "23"}
