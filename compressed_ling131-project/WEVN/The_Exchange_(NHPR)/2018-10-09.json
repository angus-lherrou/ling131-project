B. U. R. and Bruce I'm walking back and have you\nYou are and hello to Melissa and Steve\nSo all of you after the tragedy in Massachusetts as I'm sure you know the question up here in the Granite State was could've happened here and Steve you first how would you answer that question\n[noise] well I first want to recognize it was a terrible event but it just underscores the very rare events or you can check for ...\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think\nThis at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more starting with Hitchcock is here\nIt's really unusual and it's so it's over three towns of ... the five hundred customers were affected [noise] um so there are about eighty homes that big impacted by fires\nBut because uh it's a pressurized system you have to shut down the basically the whole area there was affected so even some homes might not have been affected that they were shut off for for safety reasons but I think that\nAs we can get into it uh in the discussion the safety record is strong for the gas industry in the region the nationally\nUh industry takes very seriously it's very well regulated at the state and federal level um there's a lot of training and that's part of what I'm with the trade association represents gas utilities pipeline companies and\n... that's one of our main task is to actually oversee the training of workers on the natural gas system because any work or on the gas system has to be trained\nTo specific tasks every specific tasks they have to be trained and and qualified and then they have to be re qualified than a few years so I'm lucky to get to safe and yeah and uh but this was a very disturbing\nWell sure and a lot more people could have died right Steve I'm it just so happened that it was a time of day when people weren't really at home and so um it could have been a lot worse\nYes it could have been I don't know these are so the ... the national Transportation Safety board is the actual uh agency that oversees any ah incident so we got system by the inch his speech than it was actually a transportation system so I'm at the gas is so they're looking at right so they're looking into that um\nWe're very relieved that wasn't there wasn't a more impact in terms of a fatality there were injuries and a very serious is the most serious incident in New England uh well my memory and I've been with the industry or Twenty years like\nWow okay and there's lots to unpack there in terms of worker training and how the gases transport in and so forth as you said Steve but I'm Melissa when this happened about a month ago a lot of people here in New Hampshire as I said we're saying wow could this happen here and what do you think about that question\nAbsolutely it could happen here did that happen every day no but when your piping\nAnd explosive fossil fuel into people's kitchens into people's basements\nFamilies and businesses you know should realize there's an inherent risk and that natural gas is explosive do we have oversight measures yes we do we've seen liberty gas or make errors we've seen human errors\nWith some regularity and we can't eliminate those with a fossil fuel like this\nSo to answer the question could have happened you know you would say yeah it could\nAbsolutely we have to be realistic about that\nI'm Glad that folks are on the case and trying to improve oversight improve regulation but the reality is there are cleaner safer alternatives right now and if I was a family in Massachusetts I Would be thinking about those cleaner safer alternatives\nMama death they talk about that as well how this fits into the whole bigger energy picture that we talked a lot about on this program\nUm but first you know without revisiting too much of what happened in Massachusetts but we are trying to say here's what happened and here's what we have here in New Hampshire what kinds of investigations have been underway Bruce as to the exact cause of what triggered those explosions\nSteve said the NTSB with the federal authority that overseas\nWere there are actually that night and I had a press conference the next morning and they took control the situation but of course uh you know the the gas company Columbia is is investigating they're\nTaking a second position to NTSB but I'm so that they're looking at everything there were nine projects in the area that we're going on to replace old pipes some of these pipes Laura go back over a century ago the castle in Rhode Island [noise]\nThere's there's so much old pipe here so they were working on that and it's seeming seemingly or what we where we can kind of put together here is that there are these vaults that are in the ground\nAnd they regulate the pressure that comes off of the main pipe into the service areas and they they step it down and make sure the ... or ... percent but it seems that one of these and I've kind of pinpoint you the one uh was was either tampered with or a mistakenly maintained\nA being worked on and that's where the problem originated\nThese are the regulators that I've read about food's not people regulators ... minutes stomach regulators yeah\nThere's they're they're they're buried in the ground and they're very simple devices actually I was looking at them and uh they they basically stepped down the pressure taking it from like six or eight pounds\nTo like one or half a pound or even a quarter pound to the service to the to the houses she had you know all these miles forty eight forty nine miles of Maine service going to be three towns and then they branch off like you know capillaries in in the body\nAnd uh and so between those are those ... those means is a is a vault in the ground when they bury these kind of regulators and they stepped down the pressure\nAlright well again lots to look at and I want to remind our listeners that you can join us with your questions and comments one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven send us an email exchange it N. H. P. R. dot org again exchange at N. H. P. R. dot org you can respond on Facebook or Twitter if you'd like it's an H PR\nExchange again that number one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven so let's just figure out how this whole system works and then we can look more broadly at\nHow widespread the use of natural gas it here in New England and some of the alternatives that Melissa talked about and Steve just a real primary first um how natural gas get from the plant\nTo my house is it always underground is it ever above ground how does that work\nIt's basically an underground systems so as Bruce mentioned and the the essence of the system is pressure um so the the gases delivered by\nWhat's called a transmission company interstate pipeline company and that sort of higher pressure and that can come from a from western Canada it can come from Pennsylvania can come from we get even get gas from offshore Nova Scotia comes down through interstate pipeline system\nA generally they then they handed off to the local distribution companies so in in the ... you have to ... liberty and universal\nSo with the city gate they handed off to the gas utility and then they step the pressure down further and and they have their own ... called the distribution system and so they would have to get up at a distribution name down a main street and then as as Bruce mentioned is like capillaries thunder lines op that that could go to\nA different facilities like a hospital or a or a city block or two individual homes and it\nAs they handed off the gas\nOr to those and you would call them and use customers could be residence or or or business but the pressure is step down again and it's controlled is Bruce mentioned by things like regulators there pressure sensors so that the gas that comes into your house\nNixon sending clouds today with hides in the seventies tomorrow warm and humid but highs approaching eighty degrees you're listening to an H. P. R. [noise]\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... today how safe is our natural gas infrastructure is what many Granite State of they're asking after the explosions and northern Massachusetts we're finding out about efforts companies are making the rules and rags from the state and local communities\nAnd what's supporters and opponents of this energy source hope will happen next let's hear from you the exchange numbers one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven you can always send us an email exchange\nAt an H. P. R. dot org again exchange and H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange we have three guests for the hour Melissa birch art is with us She's a staff attorney for the conservation law foundation Steve like he is he or vice president of policy for the northeast Gas Association\nAnd joining us from Boston Bruce Kellerman senior correspondent covering science and the environment for WB you are one more time that number here in exchange one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven and dumped Bruce just to clarify before the break we were talking about how\nThe independence system operator I'm headed New Hampshire and New England rely too much natural gas but the region also wants to expand um the availability of natural gas so just help us figure that out there because it sounded like conflicting messages but maybe not\nWell you know the ... who who\nUh make sure the system throughout New England the electrical distribution system is reliable right from sort of cyber attacks from going down from pronounce you name it they they want the system up and running a hundred percent of the time\nThe other thing is they they managed a market for for for um the cost of gas and really the buying and selling of capacity and ... and reuse utilities buying and selling of of their resources the generation capacity so\nWhat they've observed is their first requirement to keep it up and running and they said well we're getting more increasingly more reliance on cheap national gas\nEspecially to frack fractured gas from the Marcellus Shale region in West Virginia Virginia Pennsylvania we want to bring it up it it's it's there it's plentiful is cheap ah we needed a people wanted a let's give it to them and of course a lot of people don't want it\nThey don't want the pipeline as they don't want the safety issues and so on so that's the dichotomy that's the contradiction there well\nSo Melissa I'm again a lot of people have said including I saw that the shift to natural gas has benefited New England we've got\nClean burning relatively clean burning fossil fuel um this is what the natural gas folks say contributing to I'm a decline of air missions here in New England\nHelping keep prices stable so there's been some benefits I so has said to having lots of natural gas here in New England better than coal people off and say I just wonder what role UC Melissa for natural gas in this region\nI think bruises point that natural gas is cheap right now at this moment in history is an important one\nWe've seen a transition away from coal and the markets because that we do have other factors including the inexpensive\nCost of natural gas I'm driving a transition and so that the whole country is getting a cleaner as it comes off of coal but you have to ask yourself you're moving from one fossil fuel to another and we can't get to where we need to be\nA for our climate goals and and that means for ... for health and safety frankly we can't get to where we need to be for a long term health and safety if we just transition from one fossil fuel to another fossil fuel and what we're seeing at the same time\nUh we are seeing dramatically\nDecreasing when prices offshore wind is no longer on the horizon it is here and I'm sure when prices are\nStunning a regulators aunts and states and\nEnvironmental is you know they're these prices are lower than we had anticipated when prices are going down solar prices are going down we have a clean electric alternatives\nWe don't need to keep investing in more and more fossil fuels especially when you look at the fact that we don't\nUm you know we don't want to put millions and and potentially billions of dollars into\nPipes and the ground that we won't need to encourage\nSomething that you feel is not needed I Want to get Steven on this too but a quick question for you Melissa I'm you know solar and wind I'm often described as intermittent and so some people say hey let's keep this natural gas infrastructure\nIn place so that when solar and wind are not available we can still turn the lights on as they'll charge our phones right right so do we need some level of natural gas there just for\nSake for backup sake right well I I'm not saying rip out the pipes tomorrow [laughter] don't invest in any more it's not as smart investment of rape pears are going to pay the costs families and businesses are going to pay the costs but in it\nSpeaking um solar and wind are great and that they are very compatible wind is strong nights solar strong in the daytime and so although they're intermittent they tend to balance each other out we've also that hydra that adds to that balancing and in addition we have storage\nEnergy storage those prices are dropping as the batteries improve dramatically well they're they're the technology is getting better but it's also getting cheaper it's getting more accessible and it's being used across the country in exchange for what would be actually more expensive natural gas investment\nWell and do you want to go to you and then to our listeners you know for years and years people have come into the studio and said natural gas is a bridge fuel to these cleaner alternative\nBut we still seem to be on the bridge [laughter] I'm with you know as Bristol that's fifty sixty Seventy percent reliant so I just want to think about this idea of natural gas as a bridge feel really or are we just going to rely on it for the long term future\n... is the sort of fallen out of fashion to use the term ... but I think it oh really okay Lee is a bridge for you know and I think it's good but at the bridge we've been on the bench for a long time I got very long time and I think we're going to be on the bridge for a long time um you know I Would love for the eye so\nIn their recent report it was reliability report\nLooks at the role of natural gas actually increasing in New England over the next decade and a key reason for that is we have other options retiring we're going to have we've had a nuclear plant retire in Maine one retirement in Vermont one retire and grow mass or next year pilgrims going to retire\nIn mass another nuclear they're retiring got coal plants retiring ... oil plants retiree\nAnd I absolutely agree with Melissa about\nThe role of offshore wind is coming potentially there's gonna be another a line to Quebec for for hydropower are coming into New England and all the states in New England basically from a policy perspective regulatory ... they're all wondering Crisco to clean energy\nUm but it's still years away and so like for him in the summer in New England there was a new ... opens Salem mass\nReplaced the coal and oil unit so that's a good thing there was one that opens and the eight hundred megawatts in\nAh Connecticut so that's Fifteen hundred megawatts this year there's another gas plant opening next year in Bridgeport, Connecticut so it's really feeling the gap and I think Bruce mentioned uh you know the role of ice so uh you know I Would say that it might even say they're not really advocating for natural gas but they're just\nBeing realistic about this is the system is is what we have today this is what we have retiring you do have renewables coming in\nBut they're not here yet you know even offshore wind it was like twenty twenty to twenty four twenty five a and the role of in your stories is very exciting and every in Massachusetts is doing a lot of energy storage but it isn't quite there yet it's still and call it a prototype but it's not\nSignificant so I think really for it so the way I Would say okay we need that for gas as a base load to run and most of the time like Seventy percent right now and then when the wind and solar isn't producing part you need vast starting gaffes to come on or something else and it's fairly easy to 'em\nAnd and it's good to hear you and mill is actually a green that this is a a bridge fuel although as you point out yeah OK no he doesn't agree with that I'll get you to get just the idea that\nYou know we've been on this bridge for a while and I'm kind of study or you say that we could be on this bridge for another decade or even more what about the idea that\nIf you are focused on increasing natural gas capacity you won't put the time and energy and investment into these non fossil fuel types of energy\nOr you know I I hear that argument and there may be ... or some truth to it but then the reality is in in in New England we've added for the and I think Melissa had mentioned is like\nLot of gas and then there's the home heating the guy killed him are and we got over two hundred thousand getting customers in New England the six states molested um you know the first part of that period it was a big price spread between natural gas and oil and the favorite natural gas for people want to go just as convenient and we would say it is\nA it is a safe and reliable fuel um but even if you look and a half from looking at the census data the most recent census data permits for New Hampshire\nAnd from city arts Nashua inviting you to downtown Nashville for art walk October thirteenth fourteenth over one hundred local

P. R. dot org and Melissa\nAnd Steve let's go right back to our listeners and a leader is on the line from Dover Leila thanks for waiting you're on the air go ahead\nUh yes this is area some heartland\nOh I'm Sorry ... go ahead we put up the wrong call but You're welcome to join us Ariel\nThank you um I I Would like to echo Laura you're um mention of methane thing stronger\nGreenhouse gas than a carbon dioxide this is something that's rarely a really identified specifically in twenty Thirteen the into governmental panel on climate change pointed out\nThat I'm In the hundred year timeframe\nMethane which is natural gas eighty five Ninety five percent um is thirty four times more potent a greenhouse gas warming gas\nThan four times well yup thirty four but but in the ... year timeframe which is a critical time frame because\nWe really have to turn the\nClimate change destruction around in the near term and the twenty a campaign it's between eighty six and a hundred times and so uh when you put a gas system in which\nAppreciates over an average of fifty years on may last hundred years or cause Janet assets which encourages people to continue using it a year investing in something that really delays the transition to renewable energy as Melissa\nA report it is here if if we had the political will to embrace it so\nWell Errol how when people talk about natural gas being cleaner it's true it's clean and when it's burned by around thirty percent but the methane leaks which even if it leaks\nIn small degrees which is really really really difficult to control it cancels out the benefits\nI see what you're saying aerial let me turn to bring them in on this yeah 'cause I Know you sort of look at the bigger picture and what about that I've heard what Ariel says that um you know that um natural gas is our guest is Ed Burns cleanly more cleanly certainly than coal\nBut when the leaks happened it's it's bad in terms of a climate change\nAs everyone said you know a methane is a very potent pernicious greenhouse gas or\nSomething like ... times there's a lot of two studies on this but about ... times the rule of thumb that our use of the terms of climate warming impact of carbon dioxide over Twenty years um there have been studies that show that methane leaks are greater than three percent\nOr would result no climate benefits retired coal fired plants that is so you might as well have coal if you're going to have you know leaks now the question is how many links do we have\nAnd that's up to debate some people say one point four percent someplace to point for a but there's no question that they continue the gas is a very very important part of me to the safety of a planet\nSo you know you've got to worry about this pernicious gas and maintain the integrity of the pipeline from ... in the Marcellus or with your house\nWell and here's an email from Patricia who sort of talks about this\nYou know cost benefit and the leaks and it gets to the aging pipeline issue Patricia says liberty isn't scheduled to replace the last of its cast iron and beer steel pipe until twenty thirty four meanwhile uh she says those leaky pipes accelerate climate change and cost rate payers\nTwo point four million last year Massachusetts Patricia says passed legislation this year requiring utilities and the department of public utilities to given accounting of loss gas and to use innovative approaches to repairing and placing their old distribution lines can someone on the panel Patricia asks describe what those innovative approaches\nAre involved and whether the New Hampshire gas utilities would be willing to do something similar similar in New Hampshire so Bruce I'll give you the first part of that Mm\nTo prevent some of these leaks that um that Ariel talks about\nWhat we have laws that knew if he passed that uh three or four years ago that says that the have to categorize the leaks from one to three being one being the worst so that's new\nAnd uh they're all there are innovative ... ways of replacing pipelines uh basically they don't want to dig up the street or somebody's front yard it's very disruptive is very expensive and into what they do is they kind of they have different ways of kind of tunneling under and following the old pipes either inserting new plastic pipe\nThrough the old type or kind of drilling away the old pipe and then following back with a new new plastic PVC pipe\nSo those are the ways they're doing it but yeah you know I mean here in Massachusetts the national grid which is the largest provider of natural gas and in the commonwealth ear or has a twenty year plan all flat out I mean they've got contracts running to Twenty years where I Am not sure if their\nContracts signed but that's what they say it's going to take us Twenty years to replace the Twenty one thousand miles of pipeline here and that doesn't mean cloud included the you know the service from the main to the houses so they got a lot of work\nSo Steve what about the second part of a question of whether the New Hampshire gas utilities or be willing to do something similar in New Hampshire\nA measure so I'm actually at the start of a key metric of ah the integrity of the system is\nYour constituents with a pipe and as I mentioned the for NASA it's less than five percent of of utilities um system is considered leap from a and then liberty utilities I think just last week the week before and that's\nI guess another innovative project you're hearing a lot more about something called for new all natural gas so they announced oh what is land well so the three sources three leading sources of methane in the U.S number one is ... agriculture and cows\nMiner or a number two is natural gas systems and number three is landfills so liberty announced a plan there's a landfill in Bethlehem apparently so they're going to\nSo there's methane gas there ah from the composition and um other materials there are so they're going to plenty to capture that a ... and and a\nPurified make sure it's it's a perfect condition and go into their distribution system so that and the press release they said six percent of their gas supplies in in coming years will come from from the slang feel so they're capturing methane which Robin let it to escape or just a a ferment\nThere are of whatever um they'll capture and reuse it so it's it's it's a more efficient use 'em it's reducing environmental impact or it's operating the need for that supply source from somewhere else they're getting it from an end in region so and you see that in Vermont is doing something and even Con Edison\nWhich is the big gas utility Manhattan announced they're going to try to incorporate more renewable natural gas which\nI think you know from the East I'm landfills inside from those ad from a farm so it's a question for you Steve and then let's take another one for you but first counting said something interesting you know it's going to take Twenty years to sort of upgrade this giant pipeline infrastructure here in New England\nUm and you know one could ask well if we really all want to move towards renewables that don't leak and then our fossil fuels why bother\nTo create new infrastructure and upgrade its infrastructure when it just start doing it now\nLet's say I guess the question is really more about upgrading I'll take that instead of investing and knew which we can leave for another question uh\nWell I think you know they see the point 'cause you don't want leaky pipes and you know ... what we\nSaw in Massachusetts there's one point six million gas customers on such a ... and the regents over two and a half million or it's a very convenient people like natural\nNumber of conversions natural gas and uh it's now the leading a home heating fuel in New England long for ever would spin heating oil but now it's a natural gas or repairing the pipes are\nAs we mentioned at the start there is a safety issue there's a safety reasons let's do it and number two are reducing potential methane and\nWhat about new infrastructure because there are proposals on the table around the region to invest in New in infrastructure Bruce told us earlier that the independent system operator wants to increase capacity thing because the region is so reliant um you know groups like Melissa's would say don't bother to\nBelieve in the New England governors a few years ago put out a statement they were encouraging more pipeline capacity to serve because they're concerned about reliability issue with\nSomebody got power plants um and then we get into the whole winter you know which one of the time to get it through um recently came out with other press they met in Vermont last month and they're looking at maybe when G. or compressed natural gas is by Ellen de is liquefied natural gas um [noise] but I think so I I Would just\nW.

B. U. R. and Bruce I'm looking back but how do you\nThink you are and hello to Melissa and Steve\nSo all of you after the tragedy in Massachusetts as I'm sure you know the question up here in the Granite State was could've happened here and Steve Chu first how would you answer that question\nWell I I I first want to recognize it was a terrible event but uh just underscore it's a very rare events or you can check the state or federal data are tracking what is called incidents on the natural gas system and the number is very low\nAnd the industry obviously wants to make it zero all the time because of\nAny incentive to your can have serious repercussions this one is very unusual a in that sense of it was was it was really unusual in it so it's over three ... the the five hundred customers were affected [noise] um so the rebels eighty homes or the impacted by fires\nBut because uh it's a pressurized system you have to shut down the basically the whole area that was affected so even some homes that might not have been affected that they were shut off for for safety reasons but I think that [noise]\nIn the discussion the safety record is strong for the gas industry in the region and nationally uh industry takes it very seriously it's very well regulated\nAt the state and federal level um there's a lot of training and that's part of what I'm with the trade association represents ... pipeline companies and\n... that's one of our main task is to actually oversee the training of workers on the natural gas system because any work or on the gas system has to be trained\nTo specific tasks every specific tasks they have to be trained and and qualified and then they have to be re qualified and a few years so I'm allowed to get to safe and yeah and uh but this was a very disturbing\nWell sure and a lot more people could have died right Steve I'm it just so happened that it was a time of day when people weren't really at home and so um it could have been a lot worse\nYes it could have been I don't know these are so the ... the national Transportation Safety board is the actual\nUh agency that oversees any uh incidents so we got system by the NTSB spenders actually transportation systems so I'm as a gaffe so they're looking at right so they're looking into that um we're very relieved wasn't there wasn't a more impact in terms of a photographer injuries and a\nVery serious is the most serious incident in New England uh well my memory and I've been with the industry uh Twenty years like\nWow okay there's lots to unpack there in terms of worker training and how the gases transport in and so forth as you said Steve but I'm Melissa when this happened about a month ago a lot of people here in New Hampshire as I said we're saying wow could this happen here and what do you think about that question\n... absolutely it could happen here does it happen every day no but when your\nPiping and explosive fossil fuel into people's kitchens into people's basements\nFamilies and businesses you know should realize there's an inherent risk and that natural gases explosive do we have oversight measures yes we do but we've seen liberty gas or make errors we've seen human errors\nWith some regularity and we can't eliminate those with the fossil fuel like this\nSo to answer the question could have happened here you would say yeah it could\nAbsolutely we have to be realistic about that\nI'm Glad that folks are on the case and trying to improve oversight improve regulation but the reality is there are cleaner safer alternatives right now and if I was a family in Massachusetts I Would be thinking about those cleaner safer alternatives\nMama death they talk about that as well how that fits into the whole bigger energy picture that we talked a lot about on this program\nUm but first you to you know without revisiting too much of what happened in Massachusetts but we are trying to say here's what happened and here's what we have here in New Hampshire what kinds of investigations have been underway Bruce as to the exact cause of what triggered those explosions\nWell Steve said the the NTSB with the federal authority that oversees these investigations very in there they were there are actually that night\nAnd I had a press conference the next morning and they took control the situation but of course uh you know the the gas company Columbia is is investigating they're taking a second position to NTSB but I'm\nSo they're looking at everything there were nine projects in the area that we're going on to replace old pipes some of these pipes Laura go back over a century ago the castle in Rhode Island [noise]\nThere's there's so much oil pipe here so they were working on that and it's seeming seemingly or what we what we can kind of put together here is that there are these vaults that are in the ground and they regulate the pressure that comes off of a main pipe into the service areas and they they step it down\nIt seems that one of these and I've kind of pinpointed the one uh was was either tampered with or a a mistakenly maintained being worked on and that's where the problem originated\nThese are the regulators that I've read about food's not people regulators but like minute ride stomach regulators\nYeah they're they're they're they're buried in the ground and they're very simple devices actually I was looking at a them and uh they they basically step down the pressure taking it from like six or eight pounds\nTo like one or half a pound or even a quarter pound to the service to the to the houses so you had you know all these miles forty eight forty nine miles of Maine service going to be three towns and then they branch off like you know capillaries in a in a body\nAnd uh and so between those are those ... those means is a is a vault in the ground when they bury these kind of regulators and they stepped down the pressure\nAlright well again lots to look at and I want to remind our listeners that you can join us with your questions and comments one eight hundred eight nine to\nSix or seven seven send us an email exchange it and H. P. R. dot org again exchange at N. H. P. R. dot org you can respond on Facebook or Twitter if you'd like it's an H PR exchange again that number one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven\nSo let's just figure out how this whole system works and then we can look more broadly at\nHow widespread the use the natural gas it here in New England at some of the alternatives that Melissa talked about and Steve just a real premier first um how natural gas get from the plant to my house is it always underground is it ever above ground how does that work\nIt's basically an underground systems so as Bruce mentioned and the the essence of the system is pressure um so the the gas is delivered by\nWhat's called the transmission company interstate pipeline company and that sort of higher pressure and that can come from a from western Canada it can come from Pennsylvania can come from we get to even get gas from offshore Nova Scotia comes down to interstate pipeline system\nA generally they then they handed off to the local distribution companies so and in the ... you have to ... liberty and ...\nSo where the city gate they handed off to the gas utility and then they step the pressure down further and and they have their own ... called the distribution system and so they would have to get up as a distribution Maine down a main street and then as as Bruce mentioned is like capillaries thunder lines off that that could go to\nA different facilities like a hospital or a or a city block or two individual homes and it\nAs they handed off the gas\nOr to those and you would call them and use customers could be residence or or or business the the pressures that step down again and controlled is Bruce mentioned by things like regulators there pressure sensors so that the gas that comes into your house\nAnd from northeast credit union local and never owned offering financial products and services throughout Maine and New Hampshire information on joining at anything you died or this is an HP are [noise]\nThis is the exchange I'm more canoeing today how safe is our natural gas infrastructure is what many Granite State of they're asking after the explosions and northern Massachusetts we're finding out about efforts companies are making the rules and rags from the state and local communities\nAnd what's supporters and opponents of this energy source hope will happen next\nLet's hear from you the exchange numbers one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven you can always send us an email exchange\nAt an H. P. R. dot org again exchange and H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange we have three guests for the hour Melissa birch art is with us She's a staff attorney for the conservation law foundation Steve like he is he or vice president of policy for the northeast Gas Association\nAnd joining us from Boston ... senior correspondent covering science and the environment for WB you are one more time that number here in exchange one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven\nAnd dumped Bruce just to clarify before the break we were talking about how\nThe independence system operator I'm headed New Hampshire and New England rely too much natural gas but the region also wants to expand um the availability of natural gas so just help us figure that out there because it sounded like conflicting messages but maybe not\n[noise] well you know the show ... who's who's got two responsibilities major responsibilities one is to make sure the system throughout New England the electrical distribution system is reliable right from sort of cyber attacks from going down from brown outs you name it they they want the system up and running a hundred percent of the time\nThe other thing is they ... they managed market for for for um the cost of gas and really the buying and selling of capacity and ... and ... utilities buying and selling of of their resources the generation capacity\nTo work they've observed is the first requirement just keep it up and running and they said well we're getting more increasingly more reliance on cheap national gas\nEspecially to frack fractured gas from the Marcellus Shale region in West Virginia for junior Pennsylvania we want to bring it up it maybe it's it's\nUh we needed a people wanted a let's give it to them and of of course a lot of people don't want it they don't want the pipeline as we don't want the safety issues and so on so that's the dichotomy that's the contradiction there well\nSo Melissa I'm again\nA lot of people have said including I saw that the shift to natural gas has benefited New England we've got\nClean burning relatively clean burning fossil fuel um this is what the natural gas folks say contributing to I'm a decline of admissions here in New England helping keep prices stable so there's been some benefits\nI so has said to having lots of natural gas here in New England better than coal people often say\nI just wonder what role UC Melissa for natural gas in this region\nI think bruises point that natural gas is cheap right now at this moment in history is an important one\nWe've seen a transition away from coal and the markets because that we do have other factors including the inexpensive\nCost of natural gas I'm driving a transition and so that the whole country is getting a cleaner as it comes off of coal but you have to ask yourself you're moving from one fossil fuel to another and we can't get to where we need to be\nA for our climate goals and and that means for for health and safety frankly we can't get to where we need to be for a long term health and safety if we just transition from one fossil fuel to another fossil fuel and what we're seeing at the same time\nUh we are seeing dramatically\nDecreasing when prices offshore wind is no longer on the horizon it is here and offshore wind prices are\nStunning a regulators aunts and states and\nEnvironmental is you know they're these prices are lower than we had anticipated when prices are going down solar prices are going down we have a clean electric alternatives\nWe don't need to keep investing in more and more fossil fuels especially when you look at the fact that we don't\nUm you know we don't want to put millions and and potentially billions of dollars into\nPipes and the ground that we won't need to encourage\nSomething that you feel is not needed I Want to get Steven on this too but a quick question for you Melissa I'm you know solar and wind I'm often described as intermittent and so some people say hey let's keep this natural gas infrastructure in place\nSo that when solar and wind are not available we can still turn the lights on as still charge our phones right right so do we need some level of natural gas there just for safety sake for backup sick\nRight well I I'm not saying rip out the pipes tomorrow [laughter] don't invest in any more it's not as smart investment rape pears are going to pay the costs families and businesses are going to pay the costs but in addition a technologically speaking\nUm solar and wind are great and that they are very compatible wind is strong at night solar strong in the daytime and so although they're intermittent they tend to balance each other out we've also got hydro that adds to that balancing and in addition we have storage\nEnergy storage those prices are dropping as the batteries improve dramatically well but they're the technology is getting better but it's also getting cheaper it's getting more accessible and it's being used across the country in exchange for what would be actually more expensive natural gas investment well\nAnd people want to go to you and then to our listeners you know for years and years people have come into the studio and said natural gas is a bridge fuel to these cleaner alternative but we still seem to be on the bridge [laughter] I'm with you know as\nReliant so I just want to think about this idea of natural gas as a bridge feel really or are we just going to rely on it for the long term future\n[noise] well I ... is the sort of fallen out of fashion to use the term ... but I think it oh really okay Lee is a bridge for you know and I think it's good but and the bridge we depend on the bench for a long time I got a very long time and I think we're going to be under a bridge for a long time um you know I Would say for the ice so\nIn their recent report it was reliability report\nLooks at the role of natural gas actually increasing in New England over the next decade and a key reason for that is we have other options retiring we're going to have\nWe've had a nuclear plant retire in Maine one retirement in Vermont one retire and grow mass or next year pilgrims going to retire in mass another nuclear their retirement you get coal plants retiring ... oil plants retiring\nAnd I absolutely agree with Melissa about\nThe role of a offshore wind is coming potentially just going to be another a line to Quebec for for hydropower are coming into New England and all the states in New England basically from a policy perspective regulatory was they all want to increase go to clean energy\nUm but it's still years away and so uh like treatment or the summer in New England there was a new gas power plant that opens Salem mass\nReplaced the coal and oil unit so that's a good thing there was one that opens and the eight hundred megawatts in ah Connecticut so that's Fifteen hundred megawatts this year there's another gas plant opening next year in Bridgeport, Connecticut so it's really feeling the gap and I think Bruce mentioned\nUh you know the role of ice so uh and I I Would say it might even say they're not really advocating for natural gas but they're just\nBeing realistic about this is the system is is what we have today this is what we have retiring you do have renewables coming in but they're not here yet you know even after when it was like twenty twenty to twenty four twenty five a and the role of energy storage is very exciting and every and Massachusetts is doing a lot of energy storage but it isn't quite\nThere yet it's still and call it a prototype but it's not\nSignificant so I think really for it so the way I Would see can we need that for gas as a base load to run and most of the time like Seventy percent right now and then when the wind and solar isn't producing part you need fast starting gaffes to come on or something else and it's fairly beta um\nAnd and it's good to hear you and mill is actually a green that this is a bridge feel although as you point out yeah OK no he doesn't agree with that I'll get you to get just the idea that you know we've been on this bridge for a while and I'm kind of study or you say that we could be on this bridge for another decade or even more what about the idea that\nIf you are focused on increasing natural gas capacity you won't put the time and energy investment into these non um tougher fuel types of energy\nOr you know I I hear that argument and there may be ... or some truth to it but then the reality is in in in New England we've added for that and I think Melissa had mentioned is like two markets as a power market which he was a lot of gas and there's the\nHome heating the guy ... and we've added over two hundred thousand heating customers in New England the six states in the last decade um you know the the first part of that period there was a big price spread between natural gas and oil and the favorite natural gas so people want to get gas convenient and we say it is\nA it is a safe and reliable fuel um but even look at New Hampshire I'm looking at the sense of state of the most recent census data print it for New Hampshire natural gas the twenty percent of the home heating market a heating roles forty three percent and propane is Seventeen so that's about and electricity is nine so it's just the reality of\nThis is listener supported\n\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... tomorrow in our show a candidate forum with the first congressional district nominees from the Democratic and Republican parties Democrat Chris Pappas and Republican Eddie Edwards that you can send us your questions for the candidates before the show to exchange it an H. P. R. dot org\nAnd be sure to join us tomorrow morning live at nine\nThis are on the exchange we're looking at natural gas how it fits into the wider energy picture here in New England and what lessons we learned so far from the explosions about a month ago in Massachusetts\nYou can join us with your comments questions or concerns one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven send us an email exchange it and H. P. R. dot org and Melissa Bruce and Steve let's go right back to our listeners and a leader is\nOn the line from Dover Leila thanks for waiting you're on the air go ahead\n[noise] [noise]\nUh yes this is area from heartland\nOh I'm Sorry ... go ahead we put up the wrong call but You're welcome to join us aerial but\nThank you um I I Would like to echo Laura you're um mention of methane thing stronger greenhouse gas than a carbon dioxide\nThis is something that's rarely a really identified specifically in twenty Thirteen the anti governmental panel on climate change pointed out\nThat I'm In the hundred year timeframe\nMethane which is natural gas eighty five Ninety five percent um is thirty four times more potent\nGreenhouse gas warming gas\nThe thirty four times well\nYou hear time fame which is a critical time feign because we really have to turn the\nClimate change destruction around in the near term and the twenty a campaign it's between eighty six and a hundred times and so uh when you put a gas system in which\nAppreciates over an average of fifty years army last hundred years a cause Janet assets which encourages people to continue using it a year investing in something that really delays the transition to renewable energy as\nMelissa a report it is here if if we had the political will to embrace it so well Errol how when people talk about natural gas\nBeing cleaner it's true it's clean and when it's burned by around thirty percent but the methane leak which even if it leaks in\nSmall degrees which is really really really difficult to control it cancels out the benefits\nI see what you're saying aerial let me turn to Britain element on this yeah 'cause I Know you sort of look at the bigger picture and what\nAbout that I've heard what Ariel says that um you know that um natural gas is our guest is Ed Burns cleanly more cleanly certainly than coal button when the leaks happen it sits bad in terms of a climate change\nIs Ariel said you know a methane is a very potent pernicious greenhouse gas it's a\nI think something like ... times there's lots of studies on this but about eighty times the rule of thumb that our use of the terms of climate warming impact of carbon dioxide over Twenty years um there have been studies that show that methane leaks are greater than three percent\nA would result no climate benefits retiring coal fired plants that is\nSo you you might as well have coal if you're going to have you know leaks now the question is how many links do we have and that's up to debate some people say one point four percent someplace to point for a but there's no question that they continue the gas is a very very important part of maintain safety of the planet\nSo you know you've got to worry about this pernicious gas and maintain the integrity of the pipeline from the ... will drilling in the Marcellus all the way to your house\nWell and here's an email from Patricia who sort of talks about this you know cost benefit and the leaks and gets to the aging pipeline issue Patricia says liberty isn't scheduled to replace the last of its cast iron and bears steel pipe until twenty thirty four meanwhile uh she says those leaky pipes accelerate climate change and cost ratepayers\nTwo point four million last year Massachusetts Patricia says passed legislation this year requiring utilities and the department of public utilities given accounting of loss gas and to use innovative approaches to preparing and replacing their old distribution lines can someone on the panel Patricia asks describe what those innovative approaches\nAre involved and whether the New Hampshire gas utilities would be willing to do something similar similar in New Hampshire so Bruce I'll give you the first part of that ... what ... made of approaches has Massachusetts taken to prevent some of these leaks that um that Ariel talks about\nWhat we have laws that news we passed about three or four years ago that says would be have to categorize the leaks from one to three being one being the worst so that's new\nAnd uh they're all there are innovative ... ways of replacing pipelines are basically they don't want to dig up the street or or somebody's front yard is now very disruptive is very expensive and into what they do is they kind of they have different ways kind of tunneling under and following the old pi view inserting new plastic pipe\nThrough the old pipe or kind of drilling away the old pipe and then following it back with new new plastic PVC pipe\nSo those are the ways they're doing it but yeah you know I mean here in Massachusetts the national grid which is the largest uh\nYou're a has a twenty year plan all flat out I mean they've got contracts wanting to Twenty years where I'm not sure if their contracts signed but that's what they say it's going to take us Twenty years to replace the Twenty one thousand miles of pipeline here and that doesn't mean cloud included the you know the service from the main to the houses so they got a lot of work\nSo Steve what about the second part of a question of whether the New Hampshire gas utilities or be willing to do something similar in New Hampshire\nAs much as I mentioned at the start of a key metric of ah the integrity of the system is\nYour constituents with a pipe and as I mentioned the for NASA it's less than five percent of both utilities um system is considered leap from a and then liberty utilities I think just last week the week before and that's\nI guess another innovative project you're hearing a lot more about something called for new all natural gas so they announced oh what is land well so the three sources three leading sources of methane in the U.S number one is\n... agriculture and cows miner or a number two is natural gas systems and number three is landfills so liberty announced a plan there's a landfill in Bethlehem apparently so they're going to\nSo there's methane gas there ah from the composition and um other materials there are so they're going to planning to capture that a ... and and uh\nSure if I make sure it's it's a inappropriate condition to go into their distribution system so that in their press release they said six percent of their gas supplies in in coming years will come from from the slam feel so they're capturing methane which Robin let it to escape or just a a\nFerment there ah of whatever um they'll capture and reuse it so it's it's it's a more efficient use 'em it's reducing environmental impact or it's operating the need for that supply source from somewhere else they're getting it from an end in region so and you see that in Vermont is doing something and even Con Edison\nWhich was the big gas utility Manhattan announced they're going to try to incorporate more renewable natural gas which\nI think you know from these um landfills inside\nFrom those ad from a farm\nSo it's a question for you Steve and then the second another one for you but first counting said something interesting you know it's going to take Twenty years to sort of upgrade this giant pipeline infrastructure here in New England\nUm and you know one could ask well if we really all want to move towards renewables that don't leak and then our fossil fuels why bother\nTo create new infrastructure and upgrade its infrastructure when it just start doing it now\nWell that's I I guess the question is really more about upgrading I'll take that instead of investing and knew which we can leave for another question uh\nWell I think they see the point 'cause you don't want leaky pipes and you know ... what we saw in Massachusetts\nThere's one point six million gas customers on such a lot of us for some reason the regents over two and a half million or it's a very convenient people like natural gas and and we've seen that by the number of conversions natural gas and uh it's now the leading\nA home heating fuel in New England long for ever would spin heating oil but now it's a natural gas or repairing the pipes are I think\nAs we mentioned at the start there is a safety issue there's a safety reason let's do it and number two are reducing potential methane in\nThis what about new infrastructure because there are proposals on the table around the region to invest in New in infrastructure Bruce told us earlier that the independent system operator wants to increase capacity for him because the region is so reliant on you know groups like Melissa's would say don't bother right\nLeaving and the New England governors a few years ago put out a statement they were encouraging more pipeline capacity to serve because they're concerned about the reliability issue with\nSomebody got power plants um and we can get into the hole\nI recently did all that other press they met in Vermont last month and they're looking at maybe I wouldn't G. or compressed natural gas was by Ellen gee is liquefied natural gas um [noise] but I think so I I Would just", "show_name":
