says why should I vote for you will go in alphabetical order here Mr Edwards welcome thanks for being here and go ahead please\n\nThe morning to the audience and I look forward to our conversation today um you know one of the things I've been telling voters since April two thousand Seventeen when I announced my candidate see I grew up in a challenging environment as a young person I I'm into the United states a navy completing my academic services and entered a law enforcement\nAn occupation that was very proud of after a complete my military service my law enforcement service I started a business and I believe very deeply in our country and I believe very deeply in the values of our nation\nThat we can form a more perfect union because as often say that many of us were not born at first base second base to third base but we all get a chance of that so someone like me come from the dog I'll get a swing a bat do very best you can this nation and you got a wonderful life\nRaise a family of two children here this morning with my lovely wife uh we have two furry a kid at home that's Janet Bolan my English bulldog so uh\nWonderful so many others in I mean God Bless her country\nWell thirty second to opening statement for you to Mr ... please thank you Mr Edwards\nWell good morning Laura and Laura and great to be with you and Mr Edwards good to be with you as well today I'm I'm excited to be in this race\nAnd I feel that this is the most important mid term election of my lifetime because we need checks and balances in Washington DC we need someone representing us in Congress was going to be willing to stand up to this president when he's wrong and who's going to be able to work across the aisle to get things done for the people of New Hampshire\nWhen it's in the best interests of this district that's the record that I've had as an executive counselor for the past six years working across the aisle to put people before politics\nAnd we need to work hard to restore decency and integrity in Washington DC and I want to be a voice for the main street businesses and middle class families of New Hampshire if this is a great state to call home and I think if we raise our voices this fall we're going to be able to focus on the issues that are gonna move this day forward\nThinking Mr pappas and let's get into our questions now gentlemen and we have a lot of them the order of questioning was decided by an earlier coin toss so Mr pappas you won that coin toss we'll go first with you I Want to start with the economy please the unemployment rate as I'm sure you know is now its lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine three point seven percent\nNationally and even lower here in New Hampshire with Republicans in control of the executive and legislative branches in Washington and in Concord what can Democrats tell voters about their ability to do an even better job than the economy\nWhere we have seen good economic news and we're I'm experiencing the longest expansion in the post World War two era we've had a low unemployment rate in New Hampshire for a number of years\nAnd that presents opportunities and challenges and I think we have to make sure we have an economy that works for everyone and that means investing in the middle class in opening the doors of opportunity\nLook you know corporate earnings are as high as they've ever been a the stock market is high but the middle class is shrinking and they're increasing pressures on working families in New Hampshire\nI think we have to invest in job training to make sure that people can reach the middle class and have a good paying job we need to bring down the cost of college we need to reward hard work and make sure that the people who work hard can get ahead and stay ahead in this economy as a campaign around the district I hear a lot of concerns from families in New Hampshire\nIn one of the concerns is we need more young people to be entering the workforce here so we've got to work on making sure that college is more affordable we have the highest student debt load of any state in the country if we are going to seat economically over the long term we have to make sure that we have a strong vibrant workforce including a lot of younger people who are putting down roots and starting their careers here\nWhile Republicans will say in this campaign hey things are going pretty well um so what more can you guys offer 'em hey American stick with the plan we're doing great\nWell New Hampshire has an economy that's driven by its main street businesses most businesses are small businesses some run out of people's homes and they have very unique challenges and the top concerns I hear from local businesses aren't necessarily that\nTheir taxes are too high or that they're over regulated they're worried about where their workers are going to come from the ones that\nThey need to find today are the ones that are going to need over the next two years to replace people that are of retirement age look within the next ten years twenty five percent of our workforce in New Hampshire is going to be of retirement age so we've got to make sure that we have a well trained well skilled workforce that's ready to take our economy for\n... demographic issue certainly well known by a lot of people here in New Hampshire and Mr Ed with a different question for you on economic and fiscal issues are\nThe congressional budget office estimates that the tax cuts championed by the president and passed by Congress last year will increase the national debt to almost two trillion dollars over the next decade the deficit expected to top one trillion starting the next year you're fiscal conservative were the tax cuts Mr Edwards worth it given these debt and deficit numbers\nWell thank you for the question I I think anytime were passing on debt\nGreat grandchildren is irresponsible in that regard but the tax cuts where they are appropriate absolutely because it's spurred this economy you're saying you're seeing people are getting back to work\nYou're seeing record low unemployment across the board you're seeing businesses expand you see in businesses reconstitute a earnings in his in his um in our state in our country\nAnd so the economy is strong because the tax cuts I Believe we have more money in your pocket you spend that money more properly and government so moms and dads are spending money in their communities businesses are now starting to develop wherever we're two\nMillion businesses in our state or in our country I'm Sorry in our country where they're single operators known employees a single offer is over two million they earn anywhere from a hundred thousand dollars to three million dollars so the economy is doing really well people are really engaging in our new ownership [noise]\nBut we have to get our spending under control you know having more money in your pocket and government spends more uh I think it's inappropriate so this is more of a spinning issue than a revenue which\nMany conservatives were upset with the spending bill that did ultimately passing it was to lose the public per se I'm Still it was a compromise that did help get the help of the government stayed open which one would you voted on this spending bill\nWell I I certainly will they're challenged uh the um\nThe spending bill in a different way I Would have pushed back pretty hard on uh making sure we had more cuts\nIn the proposal uh because I think you have to reduce the spending in this country if you don't reduce the spending we can't sustain the girls that were happening I mean we're we're we're becoming more and more dependent on on government so we have to be responsible in our founders talked about this often when he said our government up and they wanted to make sure that we didn't abuse our young people moving forward\nAnd the irresponsible nature that we've seen over the years from administration to administration\nHas really um Costa unfair burden to young people\nPassing on the debt your next time solution thank you both a million children next questions from you\nMr Edwards she's first you've talked a lot about the importance of character and election and recently in Mississippi President Trump will need support mocks Christine Blasey Ford and his attacks drew laughs from the ... the crowd do you think that President Trump is an example of someone who displays strong character traits\nI I think uh again it's the I appreciate the question in this is what I've seen about ... continue to say this or we look for ways to divide our country so we point to the president's a language sometimes we say it's it's just a person what Congress has made up of five hundred thirty five people\nSort of found as set it up and I've seen some of the similar language ... are used by other members of Congress\nAnd we don't call their question and to to to account but we pass these type of a behaviors onto our young people and we say well you know we don't want young people engaged this type of behavior but they see it from all sorts of adults and to keep trying to vilify one person in this nation as\nThe president's supposed to set the example I think we all have a responsibility every single one of us\nHas a responsibility to make our nation a more perfect union and to constantly go back and forth to try to demonize the president I think is wrong I think as misguided because I've seen similar behavior across the board\nNot that I can do any behavior or any type of bullying but you see it constantly and our country's hurting right now so it's ... it takes a folk step forward\nWho are going to be willing to live up to an example that people can be proud\nTo just specifically to do you are you saying you don't condone that behavior by the president\nI don't I don't condone any type of bully whether it's on the right order laugh and I I think if if if you start to use language uh but but again but again the question is designed to to draw a conflict right and because we're not asking other folks who are in Washington\nBut a law firm of rats young and pick the jelly serving the business and nonprofit community\nNational impact uniquely New Hampshire on the Web at ... dot com\nAnd by Gibson's bookstore in Concord downtown meeting place for books greeting card games toys and coffee calendar of author book signings at events that gets in the book store dot com [noise]\nThis is New Hampshire public radio [noise]\nWelcome back to our Kennedy forum on New Hampshire's first congressional district I'm Laura ... along with Lauren children this hour we're talking with the Republican and democratic nominees Republican Eddie Edwards and Democrat Chris Pappas\nAnd gentlemen let's get right back into it just before the break Laura newer finishing up with Chris Pappas or a question about gun policy go ahead\nAnd you were talking about the importance of gun control as you see it and I just want to ask you I mean if you're elected why would you be more successful than Democrats or other represented in Congress have been on this issue in the past\nLook Ninety five percent of people in New Hampshire according to one poll support universal background checks\nSo the popular opinion is clearly there I'm there just isn't the political courage in Congress to get the job done because members of Congress\nDo nice job representing the industry but not regular people I'm gun owners and non gun owners alike so I think we can change the debate around this if we have people at the table that are willing to take up that discussion but I think we can do it in a way that protects the culture of responsible gun ownership that exists here in New Hampshire\nNext question is for you at the Edwards you are both actually this is for both of you you're both well aware by now that no matter who wins this race it will be historic\nPeople are talking a lot about this the winner will be either New Hampshire's first openly gay Congressman Chris pappas or New Hampshire's first black congressman and he had worked so starting with you Eddie\nHow meaningful would it be the person personally to have that title attached to your name [laughter] well I\nRegardless of who they are or who they love 'em that they're welcome here in New Hampshire\n[noise] thank you both like to ask you about health care this is the big big topic this election years I'm sure you know and I'm Tim Mr pappas you first a big part of the Affordable care excuse me Mr Edwards you first a big part of the Affordable CARE Act with Medicaid expansion passed with bipartisan support here in New Hampshire\nMany Republicans calling it a key tool and expanding substance abuse treatment helping low income people stay healthier stay in the workforce how do you square that support by fellow Republicans at the state house with your own position to repeal the SEA\nWell here's here's where I Believe when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act has not worked that's not worth a right here in the state of New Hampshire a middle income families middle income from his right in the state of New Hampshire are paying twenty five to thirty thousand dollars a year between your premiums in at a doctor bills\nDoes nothing affordable about that as I've been campaigning around the district I met two gentlemen who have cancer was suffering from cancer they're paying ten thousand dollars a month\nFor the treatment there's nothing affordable about this at all we're the only developed nation is that's not negotiate prescription drugs I'm right now we've taken competition out as a marketplace\nWhere there is a single hospital costs around from that hospital ... percent higher ... ... as opposed to places where there's competition so we we've increased\nThe number of people into the system decrease the number of doctors decrease the number of outlets\nAre folks are struggling to find out the price that they're going to pay for procedures and some years diction is you're you're paying\nA six hundred percent more for procedures and you're paying for and other jurisdictions so there's a lot of things that we can do to to encourage a free market healthcare solution that doesn't mean that we were not supportive of making sure that people have affordable healthcare\nSpecifically to the Affordable CARE Act um again passed with bipartisan support Medicaid expansion here in New Hampshire eighty thousand people in New Hampshire now have coverage thanks to before ... about half on Medicaid expansion about half on the exchanges if the ... repealed what happens\nTo those folks will ah they will have affordable health care then we have ... that the notion that we cannot uh address healthcare without government dependency I don't I don't buy that you know as someone who who's running up and has been personally impacted by governments delusions government programs I can tell you a\nIt created more problems in the communities I grew up in you know I had the luxury of the privileges in life are deciding what things to what things are important where things aren't important\nUh when I when I see governments and step in and started to create an environment where Ross people in their own decision making I'm concerned about that I'm concerned when the government tells you how to buy health care where to buy health care and when to use it\nSo to you Mr pappas because you favor more government involved in healthcare unlike Mr Edwards you've called for what you call universal health care how does that work how much does it cost\nI think fundamentally in this country everyone should have healthcare it shouldn't be a privilege\nThat only the wealthy few have access to look at I think you see a very stark difference between the two of us on this issue um I'm someone who provided the pivotal vote to implement Medicaid expansion in New Hampshire\nMr Edwards has said he would have voted against that bipartisan compromise which covers fifty three thousand people in the state and it's the best to we have to fight the opioid crisis I think that we have to stop the partisan sabotage effort on the Affordable CARE Act um that is trying to undermine that each and every day you know this administration is in court\nTrying to take away protections for individuals with preexisting conditions\nUm they've increased premiums on the exchanges by pulling away the cost sharing reduction that are there\nI think there should be a bipartisan space to be able to come together and focus on bringing down costs that should be ...\nThat we don't strip away the protections that are fundamental as part of the Affordable CARE Act as my opponent would like to do I don't think that we should be allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people who are older or people who are pre existing conditions that's just not right\nSo but the portable characters I'm sure you know didn't provide universal healthcare they're still people who don't get it because it's too expensive or they don't feel like it um so what's your plan for universal health care Mr path and how is that different from what many Democrats are calling for this year which is Bernie Sanders Medicare for all\nListen to one age this morning from ten am till noon right here in New Hampshire Public radio [noise]\nSupport for H.

radio\nLooking back to our foreign with the Republican and democratic candidates for New Hampshire's first congressional district Republican Eddie Edwards and Democrat Chris Pappas I'm Laura ... along with an H ... learn children ... next question from you please\nMr Edwards you first imagine you're out canvassing in the district and you knock on the door of sympathizers who say actually I'm an independent sometimes lean democratic how would you approach these voters what issues would you bring up what would you pitched to them about why they should give you a shot sure that's up to me a number of times [laughter] uh\nKnocking on doors and one of the things I talk to people about it a unity of our country uh right now we we spent a contingency this division our country and so I Believe the best way to bring people together to talk about what we have in common uh in our comments basis\nSupport for an HP ours live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustained excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England for legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you online at or dash Reno dot com\nTo their politics who are going to be but not that they're going to agree with you I've got plenty of people say I don't agree with you but they would they appreciate is the level of integrity that will be brought\nTo practice now to you but I'm the opposite question your knock on doors independent or answers but they're like right wing conservative what are you got for me\nYeah well I think we have these conversations all the time in New Hampshire most voters our independence and especially younger voters are registering for the first time don't have an affiliation with either party\nI think people like to choose between individuals and not just select to a political party so for me I talk about my work at the state house um I talk about working with governors of both parties to get things done to talk about being part of a team or in New Hampshire where you focus on putting people before politics and I have a ... a record and reputation of doing that\nAnd I'm proud that our campaigns been endorsed by a number of top Republicans and independents I'm really excited about the broad based coalition that we're building and look I'm a local business owner I run a restaurant business it's been in my family for a hundred and one years\nUm and through that experience you learn about the pressures of a running a main street business like that and I think it allows you to be able to relate to a lot of voters out there and understand what they're experiencing in their own lives um at the end of the day we've got to listen uh we've got to listen and learn from people and be their voice\nI'm not the angry person in the room but I'm someone who believes in serving leadership of listening and leading by example and that's the type of member of Congress that'll be\nThank you both and I'd like to ask you a question about veterans Mr pappas to you first but it's basically the same question for both of you one long standing issue has been whether New Hampshire veteran should have a full scale hospital and hamsters one of only two states Alaska or the other without one so what do you think\nI Believe we should and I think we deserve it our delegation has long fought for that funding and I'll continue that fight 'em but look even if we're able to secure that funding tomorrow\nI'm veterans are going to go years without receiving the care that they need right here in New Hampshire and so I think that's why it's important to make the choice program permanent to bring more providers into the network\nTo make sure that veterans can access care within their own communities you know I talked to vets quite a bit who get on a shuttle bus to Jamaica Plain or white river junction to get something really basic that they should be able to get in their own community and so for veterans who comprise about ten percent of the population in New Hampshire\nWe need to stand up for them um the way that they've stood up for us and protected this country and I think that means ensuring that uh we bring more services to the Manchester VA and that we fight for those investments that are critical\nSo yes to a full scale hospital here in New Hampshire for veterans yes and whatever services we can get in the absence of that real quickly if I could follow up there was a pretty big report that came out recently from the medical inspector from the office of the V. as medical inspector clearing the VA of wrongdoing related to the care of veterans\nAt the Manchester VA and as you know this has been a big story whistle blowers saying you know substandard care their neglect\nNow these same whistle blower say this report is a whitewash what do you think Mr path is does there need to be more investigated here or are you satisfied with what the office of medical inspectors said\nWell the ... the findings are concerning and I think um they present a path forward but we always have to talk\nTo the veterans themselves the people that are access and care to understand what their experiences look like because at the end of the day it's about customer service is about making sure that they could access to what they need so I think I Would take that imbalance with what I hear from veterans all across New Hampshire which is that we've got more work to do okay in St Paul\nAnd you have special interest here again should New Hampshire have a full scale a veterans hospital or should continue with the same system that we have right now\nWell thank you for that question in a you know last night I I held a a veterans town hall forum where nearly over a hundred veterans were there and they're significant others and I can tell you that a veterans in this country or sick or being told thank you for your service when it becomes just lip service we've had a elected officials that the state level\nOn his counsel at the federal level and very little is being done really to support our veterans\nA New Hampshire has a over a hundred and thirty thousand veterans in this state and we do have one of the highest levels of um veterans in the country\nPer capita and and I think I'm having veterans travel\nTo different states to receive the health health care they need\nIs embarrassing and as a disappointing that hasn't taken place already if you're a veteran you should be able to walk in any hospital anywhere in the country and get the services that have been that you fought for for others and that we say that all the time but nothing's ever done why because only less than one percent of our veterans\nAre less than one percent of our population actually served in the military so that's not a direct contact with veterans in our in our state but it's it's an easy talking points so absolutely we should have a four service hospital here but more importantly veterans should get the care they need in a local communities because we we don't have an infrastructure\nSo given your interest in um the private market and its ability to solve problems should we privatize veterans' services completely and Chuck this idea of a big federal system\nWhat ... well I think you have a number of veterans who like the VA because that's a fellowship there there's a connection there and uh there are so few veterans\nWhere they can go and have a conversation and talked to one another you know I went to the veterans town hall or would they held it at a VA when we're having problems at the VA and I can tell you a there's a fellowship there was a camaraderie there um but we have to be mindful\nOf just how large the V. A. S. and so to spread\nLow services\nOr in a more government control away I I think it's misguided as well I think you can have a healthy balance and make sure investors are getting the fellowship they need and the services they need without expanding the role of\nWell at this point in our foreign we'd like to give you each the opportunity to ask each other a question we asked you keep it questions relatively short so you don't need to pontificate too much and each candidate will get a minute to respond show a Mr Edwards you first please you a question for Mr practice\nOr a great when it Chris\n... [laughter] so uh you you call yourself a progressive you call yourself a part of the resistance movement or you're hoping to go to a Washington and to uh put a check on their president to impeach the president to resist the president and and I think those things are\nConcerning to a number of voters who actually voted for the person in his district and to ignore a what they've asked you to do would be a tour nor their vote or they've asked for someone who's willing to go there or\nGo to Washington and work with the president\nWhen he's right for our district just end up with the president when he's right front district and stand up when he's wrong for our district and your approach ah being part of the resistance movement um\nI think it's a little misguided so if you can explain how you would be a benefit to this district in working with the president\nI think I've shown during my time at the state house that I'm the kind of person who can work across the aisle to get things done and put people before politics and that's exactly what we need in Washington right now\nI don't believe we need someone who's unwilling to disagree with this president as you've said during your primary campaign I think we need someone who's willing to stand up to him when he's wrong and who's willing to work across the aisle\nDistrict so that's where my focus will be look this president has talked to a big game about infrastructure and I just said I'd like to get on the transportation and Infrastructure Committee\nThat's one area where we can work together on making sure that we create jobs and make investments in the future of New Hampshire and grow our economy here so I'm interested in having those types of conversations but when you look at some of the concerning policies that we've seen\nLike the policy of family separation where kids have been put in cages along our southern border\nThat requires people to stand up and I think it's important that this time in our history that we do have checks and balances that we restore decency and integrity to Washington and that we have people who are going to look out for the best interests of their districts and not give the president a blank check\nOkay and Mr pappas your turn to question Mr Edwards and you've got about sixty seconds to respond Mr Edwards go ahead Mr pappas\nW.

isn't out its lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine three point seven percent\nNationally and even lower here in New Hampshire with Republicans in control of the executive and legislative branches in Washington and in Concord what can Democrats tell voters about their ability to do an even better job than economy\nWhere we have seen good economic news and we're\nI'm experiencing the longest

that did ultimately passing it was to lose the public per se I'm Still it was a compromise it did help get the help of the government stayed open which where would you voted on this spending bill\nWell I I I certainly will they're challenged uh the um\nThe spending bill in a different way I Would have pushed back pretty hard on uh making sure that we had more cuts\nIn the proposal uh because I think you have to reduce the spending in this country if you don't reduce the spending we can't sustain a growth that we're having I mean we're we're we're becoming more and more dependent on on government so we have to be responsible in our founders talked about there's often when he said are covered it up and they wanted to make sure that we didn't abuse our young people moving forward\nAnd the irresponsible nature that we've seen over the years from administration to administration\nHas really um Costa unfair burden to the young people\nPassing on the debt you're an extra ... thank you both and Lauren children next questions from you\nMr Edwards she's first you've talked a lot about the importance of character and the election and recently in Mississippi President Trump on means support mocks Christine Blasey Ford and his attacks drew laughs from the ... the crowd do you think that President Trump is an example of someone who display strong character trait\nI I think uh again it's the er I appreciate the question and this is what I've seen about character I continue to say this or we look for ways to divide our country so we point to the president's a language sometimes we say is is this the person well Congress has made up of five hundred thirty five people\nSort of found has set it up and I've seen some of the similar language ... are used by other members of Congress\nAnd we don't call their question and to to to account but we passed these type of a behaviors onto our young people and we say well you know we don't want young people engage this type of behavior but they see it from all sorts of adults and to keep trying to vilify one person in this nation as\nThe president's supposed to set the example I think we all have a responsibility every single one of us has a responsibility to make our nation a more perfect union and to constantly go back and forth to try to demonize the president I think is wrong I think as misguided because I've seen similar behavior across the board\nNot that I can do any behavior or any type of bullying but you see it constantly and our country's hurting right now so it's ... it takes a folk step forward who are going to be willing to live up to an example that people can be problems\nSo just specifically though do you are you saying you don't condone that behavior by the president\nI don't I don't condone any type of bully whether it's on the right order laugh and I I think if if if you start to use language uh but but again but again the question is designed to to draw a conflict right because we're not asking other folks who are in Washington\nBy bluebird self storage a New Hampshire owned and operated business offering true climate control pick up for new customers and personalized service details that bluebird storage dot com [noise]\nSeven twenty now and New Hampshire public radio\nWelcome back to our candidate for a New Hampshire's first congressional district I'm Laura ... along with Lauren children this hour we're talking with the Republican and democratic nominees Republican Eddie Edwards and Democrat Chris Pappas\nAnd gentlemen let's get right back into it just before the break Lauren you were finishing up with Chris Pappas or a question about a gun policy go ahead\nAnd you were talking about the importance of gun control as you see it and I just wanted to ask you I mean if you're elected why will you be more successful than Democrats or other represented in Congress have been on this issue in the past\nLook Ninety five percent of people in New Hampshire according to one poll support universal background checks\nSo the popular opinion is clearly there I'm there just isn't the political courage in Congress to get the job done because members of Congress\nDo nice job representing the industry but not regular people I'm gun owners and non gun owners alike so I think we can change the debate around this if we have people at the table that are willing to take up that discussion but I think we can do it in a way that protects the culture of responsible gun ownership that exists here in New Hampshire\nNext question is for you at the Edwards you are both actually this is for both of you you're both well aware by now that no matter who wins this race it will be historic people are talking a lot about this the winner will be either New Hampshire's first openly gay Congressman Chris pappas\nOr New Hampshire first black congressman and he had worked so starting with you Eddie\nHow meaningful would it be the person personally to have that title attached to your name\nWell as I said earlier it would mean nothing really would not\nBecause uh having a New Hampshire having his first black congressman was first openly gay congressman does not put one dollar will secure one family or one individual in our in our state I think the the notion that we start to believe that we're special because of our\nSexual orientation or race or gender or we do a disservice to every born in this country you're not special I'm not special because I'm black\nChristmas special because he's gay you're not supposed to 'cause you're a woman were special because what we get back to our our communities our nation and our families and that's what's defined says that's what makes a special the fact that we go down this road of identity politics and we ...\nAnd believe in and we have to protect one group of Americans over another ... demonizing one group over another or promoting one group over another uh I I think it's time we get back to respecting all Americans\nI Want to stick to do with race for just a second if you can because in two thousand Thirteen us settled that discrimination lawsuit with the state of New Hampshire for a hundred and sixty thousand dollars\nAnd you had told at WNPR during the primary that while you were the law enforcement chief at the liquor commission you were subjected to years of pervasive racist insult so do you see racism as a problem in New Hampshire or do you see dozens isolated incidents\nI I see racism as a problem among certain individuals or whether it's New Hampshire or across our country uh you know one of the things I I found very interesting as someone who grew up in the south and coming to the northeast uh I I I have to and I'm just been on his most most of the people who consider themselves progress has\nBeen much more discriminatory towards me than any conservative I've ever met a moment that you kind of step on line\nAnd you've forgotten your place uh mostly by ... people who consider themselves progressive uh that's when the name calling starch that's when people say things to be like well I thought you were smarter than a year and Uncle Tom you sell out I've never had a concerted person called me on ...\nBut I've had plenty of people who consider themselves progressive liberals call me that and so I think when you start to look at it a ... and I'm smart enough to know that a conservative white men who served white women are not my enemy they're my fellow American citizens\nNo more so now I Believe that liberals or my allies\n... um it's about this I wanted to turn to you now and ask how meaningful it would be to you to have this title attached year name but you know feel free to respond anything we're talking about\nYou know it's something meaningful to me but I truly believe that\nWe're all in this together and that by telling your own story um you can ensure that other people are accepted or in their communities and can live their truth and pursue a healthy and successful life and I think that's what it's about at the end of the day about making sure that\nUh communities that feel marginalized um are brought in to um the mainstream society and are able to participate in our democracy and are able to succeed in our economy\nAnd I think there are still individuals in our state who are feeling marginalized so if there's a member of the ... community out there who's questioning their place in our state are you know maybe the sense of really strong positive message to them in the same way that electing women over\nThe last several years in New Hampshire I think has sent a very strong message to young girls about their ability to make a difference in their community at the end of the day I'm excited to be a part of a newer generation stepping forward to run for Congress this year people all across the country who are nontraditional candidates were running for an office like this\nI think it's important that everyone has a seat at the table and at the end of the day we're going to see better policy\nUm that's rooted in the communities of New Hampshire as a result\nHave you ever faced discrimination or any challenges while seeking public office\nWell not while I've been seeking public office but sure you grow up with it and you know you feel like an outsider you feel like you don't belong and I think we have to send a signal to each and every person regardless of who they are or who they love 'em that they're welcome here in New Hampshire\nThank you both like to ask you about health care this is a big big topic this election years I'm sure you know and I'm Timothy ... you first a big part of the Affordable care excuse me Mr Edwards you first a big part of the Affordable CARE Act was Medicaid expansion passed with bipartisan support here in New Hampshire\nMany Republicans calling it a key tool and expanding substance abuse treatment helping low income people stay healthier stay in the workforce\nHow do you square that support by fellow Republicans at the state house with your own position to repeal the SEA\nWell here's here's where I Believe when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act has not worked\nIn the state of New Hampshire a middle income families middle income families right here in New Hampshire are paying twenty five to thirty thousand dollars a year\nBetween their premiums in at a duck doubles does nothing affordable about that as I've been campaigning around the district I met two gentlemen who have cancer and was suffering from cancer they're paying ten thousand dollars a month for the treatment that is just an affordable about this at all we're the only developed nation is is not negotiate prescription drugs\nI'm right now we've taken competition out of the marketplace where there is a single hospital costs around from that hospital ... percent higher ... ... as opposed to places where there's competition so we we've increased\nThe number of people into the system decrease the number of doctors decrease the number of outlets\nAre folks are struggling to find out the price that they're going to pay for procedures and some years diction as your your pain\nA six hundred percent more for procedures and you're paying for and other jurisdictions so there's a lot of things that we could do to to encourage a free market healthcare solution that doesn't mean that we were not supportive of making sure that people have affordable healthcare\nSpecifically to the Affordable CARE Act um again passed with bipartisan support Medicaid expansion here in New Hampshire eighty thousand people in New Hampshire now have coverage thanks to before ... about half on Medicaid expansion about half on the exchanges it's the ... repealed what happens\nTo those folks will ah they will have affordable health care they don't have the notion that we cannot\nUh address healthcare without government dependency I don't I don't buy that you know as someone who who's running up and has been personally impacted by governments delusions government programs I can tell you are\nCreating more problems and it can be as I grew up in ... I'm had the luxury of the privilege in life are deciding what things what things are important things aren't important\nUh when I when I see government step in and started to create an environment where Ross people have their own decision making I'm concerned about that CERN when the government tells you how to buy health care where to buy health care and when to use it\nSo to you Mr pappas because you favor more government involved in health care and like Mr Edwards you've called for what you call universal health care how does that work how much does it cost\nWhile I think fundamentally in this country everyone should have healthcare it shouldn't be a privilege\nThat only the wealthy few have access to look at I think you see a very stark difference between the two of us on this issue um I'm someone who provided the pivotal vote to implement Medicaid expansion in New Hampshire\nA Mr Edwards has said he would have voted against that bipartisan compromise which covers fifty three thousand people in the state and it's the best to we have to fight the opioid crisis\nI think that we have to stop the partisan sabotage effort on the Affordable CARE Act um that is trying to undermine at each and every day you know this administration is in court\nTrying to take away protections for individuals with preexisting conditions\nUm they've increased premiums on the exchanges by pulling away the cost sharing reduction that are there I think there should be a bipartisan space to be able to come together and focus on bringing down costs that should be job number one but I think it's important that we don't strip away the protections that are fundamental as part of the Affordable CARE Act\nAs my opponent would like to do I don't think that we should be allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people who are older or people who are pre existing conditions that's just not right\nSo but the portable characters I'm sure you know didn't provide universal healthcare there's still people who don't get it because it's too expensive or they don't feel like it um so what's your plan for universal health care Mr path and how is that different from what many Democrats are calling for this year which is Bernie Sanders Medicare for all shore um look\nSupport for an HP are comes from you our listeners an from northeast delta dental

painters photographers potters and more October twenty twenty first from ten to four details at Deerfield arch tour dot beat Bush dot com [noise]\nIt's an age PR looking back to our foreign with a Republican and democratic candidates for New Hampshire's first congressional district Republican Eddie Edwards and Democrat Chris Pappas I'm Laura ... along with an HP yard Lauren children ... next question from you please\nMr Edwards you first imagine you're out canvassing in the district and you knock on the door if some voters who say actually I'm an independent sometimes lean democratic how would you approach these voters what issues would you bring up what would you pitched to them about why they should give you a shot [noise] sure that's up to me a number of times uh knocking on doors\nOne of the things I talk to people about it a unity of our country\nUh right now we we spent a contingency this division our country and so I Believe the best way to bring people together to talk about what we have in common\nUh in our comments bases and and that's being Americans notch understanding of the principals our nation and I think most independent voters want people who are going to be able to bring our country gather and I can tell you as someone who serves the United states military\nAnd law enforcement I've I had to work with people I disagree with other people I like to work with people just liked\nBut at the end of the day is about finding a common purpose\nTo make sure that we're all a moving in the same direction and I think that's missing in our country and and I think most independent voters care about that they care about people who are going to bring a sense of integrity a into their politics who are going to be but not that they're going to agree with you I got plenty of people say I don't agree with you but they would they appreciate is the level of and\nI'm sure most voters our independence and especially younger voters who are registering for the first time don't have an affiliation with either party\nI think people like to choose between individuals and not just select to a political party so for me I talk about my work at the state house um I talk about working with governors of both parties to get things done to talk about being part of a team or in New Hampshire where you focus on putting people before politics and I have a ... a record and reputation of doing that\nAnd I'm proud that our campaigns been endorsed by a number of top Republicans and independents I'm really excited about the broad based coalition that we're building and look I'm a local business owner I run a restaurant business it's been in my family for a hundred and one years\nI'm In through that experience you learn about the pressures of a running a main street business like that and I think it allows you to be able to relate to a lot of voters out there and understand what they're experiencing in their own lives at the end of the day we've got to listen uh we've got to listen and learn from people and be their voice\nI'm not the angry person in the room but I'm someone who believes in serve and leadership of listening and leading by example and that's the type of member of Congress and I'll be\nThank you both and I like to ask you a question about veterans Mr pappas to you first but it's basically the same question for both of you one long standing issue has been whether New Hampshire veteran should have a full scale hospital and they have just one of only two states Alaska's he either without one so what do you think\nI Believe we should and I think we deserve it our delegation has long fought for that funding and I'll continue that fight 'em but look even if we're able to secure that funding tomorrow\nI'm veterans are going to go years without receiving the care that they need right here in New Hampshire and so I think that's why it's important to make the choice program permanent to bring more providers into the network\nTo make sure that veterans can access care within their own communities I talked to vets quite a bit who get on a shuttle bus to Jamaica Plain or white river junction to get something really basic that they should be able to get in their own community and so for veterans who comprise about ten percent of the population in New Hampshire\nWe need to stand up for them um the way that they've stood up for us and protected this country and I think that means ensuring that uh we bring more services to the Manchester VA and that we fight for those investments that are critical\nSo yes to a full scale hospital here in New Hampshire for veterans\nYes and whatever services we can get in the absence of\nThat real quickly if I could follow up there was a pretty big report that came out recently from the medical inspector from the office of the V. as medical inspector clearing the VA of wrongdoing related to the care of veterans at the Manchester VA and as you know this has been a big story whistle blowers saying you know substandard care their neglect\nNow these same was alert said this report is a whitewash but do you think Mr path is does there need to be more investigated here or are you satisfied with what the office of medical inspector said\nWell the the findings are concerning and I think um they present a path forward but we always have to talk\nTo the veterans themselves the people that are access and care to understand what their experiences looked like because at the end of the day it's about customer service is about making sure that they could access to what they need so I think I Would take that imbalance with what I hear from veterans all across New Hampshire which is that we've got more work to do\nOK and same question for you Mr Edwards please and as a veteran you have special interest here again should New Hampshire have a full scale a veterans hospital or should continue with\nThe same system that we have right now well thank you for the question in a you know last night I I held a a veterans town hall forum were nearly over a hundred veterans were there and there's an African others and I can tell you that a veterans in this country or sick or being told\nThat you for your service when it becomes just lip service we've had a elected officials at the state level\nFrom his counsel at the federal level and very little is being done really to support our veterans\nA New Hampshire has a over a hundred and thirty thousand veterans in this state and\nUm veterans in the country per capita and and I think I'm having veterans travel\nTo different states to receive the health health care they need is embarrassing and as a disappointing that it hasn't taken place already if you're a veteran you should be able to walk in any hospital anywhere in the country and get the services that have been that you fought for for others and that\nWe say that all the time but nothing's ever done why because only less than one percent of our veterans\nAre less than one percent of our population actually served in the military so that's not a direct contact with veterans in our in our state but it's is it easy talking points so absolutely we should have eight for service hospital here but more importantly veterans should get the care they need in a local communities because we we don't have an infrastructure so\nGiven your interest in um the private market and its ability to solve problems should we privatize veterans' services completely ... and ... this idea of a big federal system\nWhat ... well I I think you have a number of veterans who liked the VA because that's a fellowship there\nThere's a connection there and uh there are so few veterans where they can go and have a conversation and talked to one another you know I went to the veterans town hall or when they held it at a VA when we're having problems with the ... and I can tell you a there's a fellowship there was a camaraderie there um but we have to be mindful\nOf just how large the V. A. S. and so to spread a low services or in a more government control away I I think as misguided as well I think you can have a healthy balance and make sure veterans are getting the fellowship they need and the services they need without expanding the role of\nWell at this point in our foreign we'd like to give you each the opportunity to ask each other a question we asked you keep it questions relatively short so you don't need to pontificate too much and each candidate will get a minute to respond show a Mr Edwards you first please you a question for Mr practice\nOr great when it Chris ordering [laughter] so uh you you call yourself a progressive you call yourself a part of the resistance movement\nOr you're hoping to go to a Washington and to uh put a\nCheck on their president to impeach the president to resist the president and and I think those things are concerning to a number of voters who actually voted for the person in his district and to ignore a what they've asked you to do would be a tour nor their vote or they've asked for someone who's willing to go there or\nGo to Washington and work with the president\nWhen he's right for our district just end up with the president when he's right front district and stand up when he's wrong for our district and your approach ah being part of the resistance movement um\nI think it's a little misguided so if you can explain how you would be a benefit to this district in working with the president\nI think I've shown during my time at the state house that I'm the kind of person who can work across the aisle to get things done and put people before politics and that's exactly what we need in Washington right now\nI don't believe we need someone who's unwilling to disagree with this president as you've said during your primary campaign I think we need someone who's willing to stand up to him when he's wrong and who's willing to work across the aisle when there are good ideas across the aisle are never going to benefit this district so that's where my focus will be look this president has talked to a big game\nAbout infrastructure and I just said I'd like to get on the transportation and Infrastructure Committee\nThat's one area where we can work together on making sure that we create jobs and make investments in the future of New Hampshire and grow our economy here so I'm interested in having those types of conversations but when you look at some of the concerning policies that we've seen\nLike the policy of family separation where kids have been put in cages along our southern border that requires people to stand up and I think it's important that this time in our history that we do have checks and balances that we restore decency and integrity to Washington and that we have people who are going to look out for the best interests of their districts\nMr pappas your turn to question Mr Edwards and you've got about sixty seconds to respond Mr Ed or it's go ahead Mr pappas\nOne critical issue at this point in time in our history is ensuring that we protect the rights of women and women in this country um are facing um a lot of pressure from politicians in office who want to put up roadblocks for them to be able to access their constitutional rights", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "10"}
