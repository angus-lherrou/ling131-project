I think a lot of folks do I do a lot with kids so issues whether it's in schools early childhood education the D.C why of crisis that we inherited the mental health crisis\nThat we inherited we've been able to really challenge ourselves to build on those those structures if you will\nAnd it's not just what you get done it's how you do it right it's how you work across the aisle how your cordial how you invite stakeholders to the table and all these issues that really defines a lot of our success and\nAgain you know you can't let the negativity of Washington to find a how we're going to do it here we become that gold standard we've stood out and because we work together we've been able to get things done for New Hampshire so it's an exciting time a lot more work to do um uh but again we we've got the right teams in place and we're excited to move forward\nThank you governance new new let's get into our questions and the orders questioning was decided by an earlier coin toss evidence new a new one that coin toss it will turn to you first and let's start with our voting system\nA judge this week block the use of a new voting law called S. B. three saying that instead of combating voter fraud the law imposes additional burdens he said on legitimate voters\nGovernor you said this ruling was politically motivated what do you mean by that\nWell I mean that is is it a coincidence that the ruling came about two weeks before the election [laughter] it's pretty obvious so let's understand ... ESPY three is it simply says that anyone can go up and vote 'em if you have an id great if you don't you still get to vote no one gets turned away from the polls and we simply asked that\nWithin thirty days that's a long period of time you come back and show your proof of of being almost older or resident of the state is actually quite simple so um I think those are the attorney general or they're going to look through through pathways again you got to get through the political aspects of this and just make sure that we have integrity and our system we're the first in the nation primary you have\nTo have integrity we've had loopholes in our system which is why when\nI I hate that bill because I'm a nervous it could unconstitutionally suppress the vote so what did I Do as governor I did exactly what you should do we send it to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court came back to you know mostly the three judges that will find on it said unanimously not only was it constitutional but it was in New Hampshire interest because we're the only state when the only state from the country\nWhere you don't have to be a fulltime resident she'll just putting us on par the end of the Davis all has to be both fairness and equality\nWell the governor had lots of excuse me the judge had lots of concerns are long lines at polling place if you said certain groups um including minorities and students and people who are homeless and he was afraid they might feel suppressed from voting so you're not really er and those concerns\nWell that doesn't make sense as first as always long lines of polling places I don't know how this would make it longer in fact we're providing flexibility so if you don't have your ID you can come back at a later time so it doesn't really make sense\nCenter Kelly to you a different voting question the attorney general's office has recently charge several voters with fraud those cases have not yet been prosecuted still given that these cases do exist how open argue to any changes to voter eligibility or registration\nWell you know I just do want to back up just for a minute on that question into 'em to relate to the two bills that ah\nAh we're a before the legislators today or this year and came to the attention of our governor which was that the three and then in the house bill as well I Would have a veto and both of those bills you know I've spent a lifetime breaking down barriers are making sure that people can vote within a democracy\nOr the state of New Hampshire has an excellent record\nOf of uh making sure that ah there is no fraud there have been maybe one or two instances but we have had very very limited uh uh any uh really accusations\nAnd founding on that you know in fact what are the superior court in their injunction to stop at the the three one of the things they\nThey actually had his burdensome or it's irresponsible and it's discriminatory in particular to discriminated and targeted are college students which is which is unacceptable\nUm so I think that when you balance uh maybe an incident maybe two incidents of what the court really said was it's not enough\nAh to a a bird and the rest of the voters and as you said long lines and uh\nSo to my question center Kelly and just thirty seconds please so any changes um do you think that needs to be made to voter eligibility registration\nWell I Do stand about possible ... no I think I think the laws that we've had a New Hampshire are absolutely up have worked and as the court had said we're going to go back to where we were before age before the house failed in the Senate bill go back to ... has as we have always a\nA defined it and continue to move forward that way and that will be in effect for this for this election as well and I think people need to understand that we are going back to our definitions that we were and have worked here in this state\nOkay thank you both and Josh next question comes from you\nOr a return to taxes or senator color you close to veto sales or income tax something you never did until running for governor you also say you'd preserve the original reduction to the business enterprises charts but would like to reverse cuts made to the business profit starts\nMinor things you also want to legalize and tax marijuana so are those changes on the business profit church and taxing marijuana you only tax changes your vision or you know as as in the past two or more options on the table for you\nYet just thank you for that question yes I have been absolutely clear that I Do not support and that I wouldn't veto a sales or an income tax um and I've been very clear about that and in the Senate I did a vote to cut taxes for a a small businesses\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our listeners and from New Hampshire school administrators association representing school superintendent center administrators championing the education of children every day and age has a a yard

celebrating fall with a pumpkin ... expressed upon event for the whole family schedule at Conway senior ... dot com\nJourney partly to mostly sunny for today's only chance of simmering showers in northern parts of the state temperatures today or thirties to mid forties [noise] this is an HBO\nWelcome back to our candidate forum for New Hampshire governor I'm Laura ... along with Josh Rogers this hour we're ... we're talking with the Republican and democratic nominees Governor Crist the new new and former state senator Molly Kelly were coming to live from Manchester community college and let's jump right back into our topics and Josh you get the next question\nOr if you're a center of tell you folks to great great deal on family leave and what are what are those besides a policy or what specific items do you have on your agenda that would improve the lives of the struggling families you talk about for the campaign trail and please be specific and say how you pay for them or\nWell thank you thank you jobs and as I said earlier in our discussion you know that uh I I understand the challenges that working family a faith because I have lived them and yes I Do support the paid family medical leave act I think\nWant a a paid family medical leave act and and you know that what it is is that\nUh people should be able to be with the people that care the most about when those people need them as well\nUm you know I Know that my opponent had an opportunity to pass the paid family medical leave act out just this last year did not and later called it a vacation it's not a vacation it is about taking care of and caring for our newborn it's about being with her elderly parents when they're ill\nAh it's about being with children when they need you or making that decision terrible to have to make a choice about doing that or maybe losing your job not being able to pay your mortgage your rent or to teach your children\nAre so I feel that uh uh I understand that challenge and uh I Will make paid family medical leave\n'em a reality I think the other uh that I Would like to do to improve people's lives one is that we do need to move forward to livable wage uh I hear people every day in particular families who are really frustrated because affordable\nHousing is out of reach for them they cannot find affordable housing and property taxes taxes continue to go up\nUm so we do we do need to move forward with minimum wage and I will do that as well um you know we talked about state schools it improves the lives of all of our families in our area that I have pushed forward for renewable energy in our state I did that when I was in the Senate put forth the first a renewable\nEnergy hundred for good net meter and a half by going over my time is how you're pointing to me not looking at the clock acting\nNow starting to get where we go next ... years ago governor dumb to you on on family leave when you ran last time you said you were interested in having a paid family leave program\nBut you know as we know is governor you ended up having reservations about the bill that are cleared the house so you cited physical concerns over its solvency but you never rolled out a policy of your own now you say you want to plan that could be voluntary and operates in the private market [noise] um\nSo we're already hearing what you paid family medical leave\nAnd this was a case where the Democrats took a good idea and twisted it into an effect of income tax essentially destroying the possibility of moving forward so badly that are commissioner of employment security stood up the commissioner of insurance stood up and said we can't this could go bankrupt who can't vote shirts financial solvency imagine a governor supporting a plan\nWhere people are paying into a system that could go bankrupt so when you have to drive down the benefits they're not there anymore\nRight my plan is actually quite simple we bring the private sector and my plan includes state employees her plan does not my plan has no start up costs no operational costs because we bring the private sector and her plan has nearly twenty million dollars just to get the thing up and running\nAnd most importantly my plan brings companies the majority of companies in the state that are fifty employees and less now getting included her plan does not include that she'll by bringing scoop challenger ... plan\nBecause that's exactly it so you bring in third party insurers right almost like um like we do now like almost like an Affleck I don't want to name companies necessarily but almost like they do as a supplemental insurance\nYou provide that supplemental insurance for the state employees what you're getting her plane didn't include a very large employment pool\nThe rate school very low and you can share those rates out into the private market the bear the cost of running the system in the operational costs we get the benefits of letting anybody choose and I'm like her plan where once you've um I mean this was a plan where if you didn't certify having no public notary certify a piece of paper within six days you are stuck in the program\nAnd you couldn't get out my program works like traditional insurance you can go in and out just like on a yearly will just require build your office will be back here yes absolutely look when their plans failed and we looked at amendments Dylan over a minute we tried to do it in a similar way but we kept working at it just because it feel we kept working at a hard and we kept moving forward\nGauge providers engage the system and it's a plane where again the commissioners the experts have said this will work with and we never actually from Europe's never propose\nIt will be absolutely be proposed in the next ... during the day last year or no because again no one has ever done anything like this this is a whole new way of doing it which is very exciting we can become that gold standard and then again it takes the burden off taxpayers inlaws everybody down to twenty employees her plan doesn't do that\nBusiness is down to twenty please can all participate in it and that's the majority of companies in the state right senator and the response\nBut you know it's interesting um when I hear my opponent talk about his plan a he was obviously the governor when ...\nHad a bean that it and it would have to the house three times three times in the house\nUm he had a majority of his own party in the house and Senate if he wanted to put through a ... family medical leave act that was the time to do it he didn't do it he had an opportunity to do it and later called it a vacation high as governor will ensure that we do past\nWere created only ... leaves only coming soon to give you thirty seconds to respond to let her clinic and I went on to our member station ... it's not a vacation to be very ... it's obviously not a vacation that comment came as part of a bigger conversation of course is not a vacation that's that's silly\nI'm at the end of the day when their plan we realized it was a trap of an income tax we try to ... over a minute we tried to support that that didn't get past I don't control the whole house and would love to have gone that done but in not getting it done it's allowed us to go back to the drawing table and create a whole new system and something that has never been done before that should be very exciting for folks\nThat broader that doesn't have the burdens of costs that includes more people are in that is truly financially viable in solving for those who would pay into it\nAll right that's a big issue in this campaign and I'm sure we'll hear more about that as the election gets closer and Josh our next question is also from you go ahead or will stick\nWith the mechanics of working with the legislature our governor you said you don't think like a legislature and you know it could be argued that it shows in your record a lot of the high profile policies you've asked lawmakers to back right to work education savings accounts ... law the Internet sales tax fix\nFailed and that was despite your strong public support\nAnd the legislature and two hundred and fifty and alleged allegedly did pass okay but I mean these are not going to be the ones who got out there on I mean you know you didn't walk around with her and everything\nWhen you believe passionately about something I Will fight for every single issue even if I think it's an uphill battle even if I think it can't be one you gotta put what you you got to believe and what you believe and fight hard for it when you brought up martial law right when it came to the issues of assault\nAnd abused women I stood right they're side by side with ... we knew was taught battle bomb had lost his daughter brutally raped and murdered was terrible\nAnd we stood out I was the state leader on it my opponent sat silent said nothing that's shameful frankly and that that hurt so to be out there fighting for something you believe in is very important even if you think you can't get past in the legislature 'cause you're gonna come back\nTo why he couldn't find them again why couldn't these things get passed so that's that's what the question is what should the public because they know what will go out and everything you and you're asking me why every issue I Believe in didn't get to know about about let's say we're out front on and yeah and a war because all human labor legislature\nVotes not me I didn't I didn't veto or vote on family medical leave I didn't tell her vote right to work or nurses all these issues they never actually got to my desk so you're passionate you work with the committees you go out there you testify you work with advocates\nI mean that's how it gets done not everything is going to be on your complaining 'cause I didn't have a hundred percent success rate developing legislation done\nIn this administration than any governor in Twenty years any governor and Twenty years go look at the record it's absolutely their child welfare reform mental health reform what we're doing at the opioid crisis is what we've done with business taxes and the economy I mean\nI think that's all you have a follow up I don't follow up on your on your advocate\nYou said companies or we're going to try to force business a year to collect taxes would be in for the fight of their life you call the special session with ... along with the legislative leaders went on special social is taking place you are to Republican Governors Association meeting in Colorado that bill failed you said we're going to keep on fighting and like you know look at old\nPass through the Senate unanimously if I ever you're right because if I ever thought in a hundred years that the Democrats the majority of Democrats would stand up and kill a bill for political reasons essentially putting the burden of small businesses to have to pay other state sales tax you're right I was shocked that I think we were all shocked that that they were celebrating in the halls afterwards\nTimes reporter Susan Craig Ross Buettner breakdown what taxes were

I'm nor can only along with any PR senior political reporter Josh Rogers were coming to you live from Manchester community college and in addition to listening tonight you can also watch us on Facebook Live Josh the next question comes from you please\nLet's talk about education funding as you both know the states required\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from revision energy a local employee owned company helping thousands of granted staters go solar\nRevision energy is currently growing their team of electricians and plumbers learn more at revision energy dot com slash careers\nA donor towns and receiver towns the form of sometimes work to change the formula\nBut we were in the process we've removed what is essentially the most um parliamentary bought the most representative body in the world foreign represented for a million people that's the voice of the people they should have the power of the purse in determining a you know we're funds might need to be a look at X journal variables that might not show up in a formula\nRight maybe up a business moves from one town to another or business comes into a town or town's property taxes move for a certain reason but the legislature look at all those variables to make the decision of where the funding needs to go it's it's ensuring that the people have the final say\nSo you said you'd support a constitutional amendment to essentially what the legislature decided\nI'm ... I mean the whole point of having such a representative legislature why would we I mean right now we have a sense of courts dictating that why would the why should we look judges dictate our our education funding is decided\nBut so do you see any role for judges in the courts to guarantee protections for for individuals\nI think the constitution needs to guarantee those protections yes\nSo you don't think that if an individual you're\nAn individual judge making a determination how on a single formula how every town is going to be funded and I I don't think anybody agrees that that makes logical sense\nSo you don't think that the court should have any role when it comes to education funding\nJust an ensuring knows well she quit ensuring that the constitution is upheld and again I'm you know we talked about advocacy and cherish and all that I Would love to see a constitutional amendment that ensures that the legislature has the power of the purse so communities and people have the real voice\nOkay center Charles or turn to you um you know the states picking a twenty percent of what district starts we pay to educate children do you think that needs to change\nI I think that uh uh and it it has been for me in the Senate and it will be as governor that education which is my priority and we do need to fund education a as a priority [noise]\nUm and you know a couple of things come to mind right away and say I heard my point and say we have more money than we know what to do to do with a you know in my budget my budget and like all of us when we make a budget we put at the top what's most important to have a education will be at the top and a\nAnd I think that we do have to increase the funding on education I Would not I would not\nEver support and I would veto any school voucher program that took money from public education\nAnd moved it to a private and religious school which weakens public education and raises a property taxes as governor I went to strengthen our public education and certainly not raise property taxes we ... we lips or I was gonna say we also\nUm my opponent has a\nA given tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations reprint is the wealthiest corporations are and uh\nUh here we are at a point where what we need is an educated in a prepared workforce our businesses are crying out for our young people are leaving our state because they don't think there are opportunities we need to invest money and the funding instead of the tax breaks into education into job training and to make college affordable\nAnd we'll go to you for sort of you know so I can go to clarify your vision of costs just run because as a senator you voted for a constitutional amendment that would have limited the state's responsibility route of course we get fifty percent do still believe\nThat the amendment that I support it in the intent of that amendment or what to make sure that the communities who needed a the funding them both received the funding and it did not reveal remove the courts\nSo I I I Want to do\nLike oh no let's be very clear the school choice school choices on public versus private school choice is allowing a student in the public schools in our public schools are phenomenal I'm the first governor twenty five years to come up to New Hampshire public schools they're phenomenal but they don't work for everybody\nAnd the bill that we looked at provided opportunity equal opportunity on the same principle wife fought so hard for kindergarten to make sure that low income families only those are the poverty line and below had the same opportunity to use a small portion of funds to to allow their child to go somewhere and we we kept\nThe liability on each town and we made sure that again even her on her own to attack\nAd or get another attack ad for my opponent says I I Know it just it's less than one percent of our budget spending less than one percent of the budget to provide an opportunity for kids were the four walls of the classroom don't work is a tremendous opportunity for them as individuals and by the way it allows my bill a lot of the local money to stay in the school\nThe dollars per child went up\nIn every school because the local money stayed even though the child had another option to go somewhere else it was a great time and unfortunate politics and bureaucracy took over and and in the show that will come back if you ...\nWhat the legislature puts it back sure I'd love to see it come back you know why because it helps the most needy it provides equal opportunity for those that don't have other opportunities out there All right I Want to move on\nTo energy and climate we've got lots of questions about this from our listeners this when it comes from a listener Gerald who says\nClimate change is happening faster than projected and brings with it huge economic consequences Gerald says what should our governor do to address it Joe thanks for the question and Senator Kelly you first what is the state's role if any in helping communities deal with climate change\nWhat climate change is real or it is real and we need to act urgency urgently on this uh\nOn climate change and you know we also know that climate change is caused by human behavior uh my opponent has real doubts about that and doubts about uh the reality of climate change as governor as governor I Would put forth at an energy policy that is based on science and it's based on fact\nUm and I would move our state away from fossil fuel towards a more to a renewable energy and you know I Know how to do that I did it when I was in the Senate we talked about that\nA little bit earlier um New Hampshire prides itself\nOn the environment we know that uh\nUh all of its here uh want to continue an environment that provides clean air clean water up for all of all of our uh the people who live here in New Hampshire so yes I have been progressive and moving forward addressing the issue of climate change and we need to be able to to continue sitting\nGovernors and they'll give you better talk about look she went up contributed to come to climate change what her ... her assessment of music is completely unfair\nI'm an environmental engineer that's what I did for a living the care of the environment and clean drinking water cleaning up hazardous waste sites and that is what I spent my career doing\nSo again when you look at issues are that can affect the state were incredibly responsible state when it comes to the environment we have some of the cleanest air in the world right here\nI spent again my career cleaning up groundwater has contaminants out of groundwater which is why when we have a problem with ground water which we do in the state we're putting two hundred and Seventy five million dollar to clean drinking water infrastructure were making the biggest investment ever when they threatened to drill off of our coast that I pick up the phone no I got on a plane and I flew down\nAnd I sat with secretary Zinke ... and I got a commitment\nThey won't be drilling for oil off the New Hampshire coast\nSo when their issues to beer we move forward on them when you look at the Paris climate accord you know we have some stricter standards in the Paris climate accord even calls for\nShow our state has taken these issues incredibly seriously we're moving forward and everybody should be very proud they live in a place where the environment is so\nCherish well let's turn back to the idea of fossil fuels and I'll give you thirty seconds I'm Senator Kelly and then come to send you thirty seconds as well because it's new to it\nAlternative energy projects such as the ones that you promote um will cost low income grand staters more money that we need to be careful when we move away from fossil fuels because there could be an expense for struggling families so I Wonder how you move from fossil fuels to some of these alternative in um a cost effective way\nI disagree with that uh you know my experience with the group net metering in renewable energy bill that that pass\n'em and that was then detailed for an expansion I traveled to state and talked to many communities that actually had put forward\nPut forth a solar hydro for example and that's what they own their own hydro plant and they now are devastated that they can't move forward because the veto of my opponent if they had been able to move forward they would have been\nProducing clean energy and being able to supply that energy to their town meetings and to their town building some sorry and to their schools which would have lowered\nWu BJ Jackson Ninety nine point five W ...

[laughter] I don't know why that was [noise]\nBut I didn't have the money so I didn't send it and I kept putting them off enough that they finally gave up calling me\nOkay so they gave up but uh it was pretty scary and he was pretty upset and trying to say he I Wonder how frequently you hear about the grandparents came and how often it it's successful\nYeah or oftentimes people are just inclined to talk about when they get scammed there and there is there an barest you know because people want to feel particularly or older folks who wish to stay on uh\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members on from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked ... in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think is a Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here\nThere was an art history and what they do we can talk about that a little later there's nothing beautiful about the art necessarily but it's certainly artistic and we can talk about why the artistry works and why it gets people where they get where they\nWell yeah and an A. R. P. did a fascinating story on I'm interviewing people who actually have been caught and prosecuted um which you know attorney but that he would tell us later he was a very hard crimes to catch A R P did\nInterview a few of these people who had been caught and they talked about those emotional strings that they pulled what ah what did you find out on one interview these folks\nWhile they talk about the ether and if there is something that the listeners should remember today it's the ether and you think about ether when you're used to go to the dentist and good either I don't know where one gets ether today but\nI'm ... ether in this discussion is is a heightened emotional state and it makes it hard to think clearly and make rational decisions so it's worth repeating it's a\nIt's a heightened emotional state that makes it hard to think clearly make rational decisions\nAnd what it does is it that a master closer call them the scam artist put you in this position and they hit their hitting the buttons of fear and greed and urgency and then that puts people in the state of wanting to do what it is that's being asked of them\nAnd that's that's that's the artistry of it isn't the various as it is that's the artistry of it and and our goal is to work to make sure we can combat that like today\nYeah so I'm a former going what are you hearing about in terms of senior scams besides the grandparents games what other sort of elders scams tend to come to your attention\nOr we do see the grandparents scam in Hudson and I would assume any local law enforcement department but we also see the IRS phone calls of a threatening to be arrested um at least the more recent ones that we've been seeing are the um the local utility\nYour utilities aren't paid and you need to pay them quickly um they're asking for payment and gift cards um and rather than sending the gift cards what are the victims are doing is they're reading the serial numbers off of the back which is extremely hard to trace at that point um so those are the things that were saying on a local\nLevel so what is senior say when they call your office I'm officer down and you know do they say I was taken end do they say this happened to me can you check it out what are they hoping to get from you\nIt's it's kinda hard to answer that question just because there's so many different scams going on out there and so depending on the scam sometimes we are able to investigate it more thoroughly\nAnd from the valley and Middleton building supply offering all types of flooring including hardwood vinyl tile limited and carpet installation available location information ... valleys dot com\nThis is an age PR\nThis is the exchange on Lorch annoy today elder fraud the scams that come in through the mail or over the phone or on line\nThat especially targets senior citizens and we're hearing about a lot of these IRS scams arrest charges against these scams the grand parents scam join us have you or family or friend\nA experienced is like to hear your stories and get your questions in send us an email exchange it an H.

I think that's exactly right and and uh you have to be vigilant if if you have a senior relative\nYou know you should check on that person you could check their their um their their voice mails my mom is Ninety five and she's in the assisted living in Massachusetts and then when I go to visit her the first thing I Do is check her phone messages [laughter] 'cause that's not to monitor what\nAgain and I'm a big but you have to have to sort of just be in touch with people isolation is that is a terrible thing and it really is one of the things that fuels a lot of these scams that allows them to happen to you know of friends or family who has\nUm had experience with these types of elder scams ah well we certainly have talked to a lot of the ages officer sure we've I'm\nA ... I mean it's it's just it's such a common thing and the stories of hot breaking you know when you when you listen to it some of them involve you know thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars by the time it's all over\nAnd um so it's if you really have to have to be very careful you have to watch and be and care for the people your neighbors your relatives and make sure that they're not being victimized\nAnd you seem to be saying Todd too that this is an underreported crime because some senior citizens\nDon't want it known that they got taken in because they don't want people to say oh you know mom you really you've got taken and maybe it's time for you to just you know\nMoving to the nursing home right I think that's right before we started we all sort of talked about stories where we could name people end up to not embarrassed them or I Would never do that but there are some prominent prominent people who have done phenomenal things in New Hampshire that I Know personally who were\nWho were either victimized are so close to what they were a just a hair away but they decided to breed before they acted and that's the thing is you take a breath and again if it's too good to be true probably as well it's like\nYou said it's hard to breathe when you're under the ether when you're in that emotional our diversity anxiety\nState let's go back to our listeners all of you and again our number one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven and a Janice calling from dairy Hi Jenna thanks for calling exchange you're on the air\nHi thanks for sure\nAnd Congress where they attempted to recognize that real time there were a white picket guy like I don't remember it won something I Believe that anyone from things that give them money in order to collect multimillion dollar\nPrize process and see something like that I\nWas going to come to that\nJanet Leigh I'm his commonsense wind over his ... and he called my older sister and so\nOf us is five daughters for ever showed up at his house that morning and we also call the police\nAnd ah they came and they talk to him at length about you know these kinds of scams and things but\nI'm so fortunately nothing came of that and my dad was embarrassed and that's what happens often I mean he's a\nHard working man he was in World War two that he raised seven children and here he was being victimized by the skin the this very embarrassed and um so I think sometimes we don't hear about them because they're so embarrassed\nThey've that's happened to them or other I'm\nKind of thing that I haven't heard your matching it and that's all them ailing that they get my dad opened every single piece of mail that he got and he had it was very intelligent he was very well read any add political interests and so he would send money into every single\nPolitical cars out there that sounded like it with what he's supported and we tried to tell him that for many of these\nFor all of them he didn't know how much of the money was actually going to support that cars ... and we you know would show him article saying you know maybe only dine out of every dollar that you sent to actually goes to the cause and we tried to convince him to\nWell yeah and Jenna I'm Glad you called because we've been talking a lot about phone scams but boy the male scams 'em and you know older people maybe I'm stereotyping do tend to look at their mail and open it and some of these men scams of Tim a gallon\nI mean I get some of the stuff in the mail and it looks like it is from Social Security the IRS um conquered police I mean it looks super legit I Wonder what you think about John his little\nAbsolutely and you know not only the males that you also see a lot of a Web sites online that will mimic\nLegitimate banks or federal agencies or whatnot you just you have to be careful and do you mean research if you if you are generally nuts to donate your own money um I just I strongly encourage people to to do their own research\nUm you know it's one thing for someone to reach out to you asking for a donation um but like I said you just you just need to do your research and make sure let's legitimate most websites will actually tell you how much of your donation goes to administration fees um or the actual charity or cause or whatever you're trying to\nPromote the one thing I wanted to know it was when general had said she called the police and I I Can't\nI Can't encourage people to do that enough even if you didn't fall victim to the scan it's still a good idea to call your local you want to know about it the police department wants to know about it a lot of police department's use social media for alerts\nAnd they'll let folks know when they're seeing a lot of um calls about the IRS scam other grandparents can just to keep people are prize of what we're seeing on a local level\nSo even though James told us there's really nothing we can do practically once you send in the money if you guys know that this has happened in your community you could at least put the word I absolutely\nAbsolutely and you know I give presentations all over the state and I always kind of you know comes back to one thing education education education don't be afraid to tell your stories because someone else is going to learn from that right\nGo ahead James so a couple of things one is at the age is office has a charitable trust unit that did the regulation monitors charities so if you're being solicited for for charity they have to register with the charitable trust unit\nDetails that had rally Subaru dot com and from harvest he'll Lebanon New Hampshire is senior independent and assisted living community and the upper valley information at six zero three four four eight seven four five eight\nThis is an HBO are\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... this hour we're looking at scams targeting the elderly and let's hear from you been hearing lots of stories from our listeners\nVarious types of scams on the phone on line in the traditional male our number is one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven send us an email exchange and each PR data work you can respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange\nAnd I'm tired say he before we go back to our listeners so how are you guys at a A R P hitting back on this it seems to be a rise in scams targeting the elderly sure\nHum the springs a big smile to my face so\nThat the the best the best ... is a good defense as you heard a ops from a Gawain and attorney buffet id say once that money has gone it's going to be very hard to get it back so um\nAnd it's not just that there's the emotional shame and everything else that goes along with it it's not just an economic last person I think there's a loss of you know self esteem sometimes and and and what not\nWhat we're trying to do is to educate people and we do that in a few ways we do it with our um we have a we have dozens of people who go around the state and they do fraud presentations to alert people to the scams they talked about the ether in more detail than we can get into this morning to talk about the scams the scams that target veterans\nUm the scams that it hit younger people I mean there's a whole set of scams that just hit veterans never just never mind older people\nAgain pulling on those heartstrings and getting people in that emotional ether that you keep talking shower sure\nBut it's just it's it's it's exploiting our vulnerability of people I mean sometimes people\nTo get they'll try to\nDefraud them from their benefits with the promise of a bigger and quicker pay out and it's it's it's it's hard enough to navigate the world we live in without having to feel that your your home minding your own business and then people are actually actively coming to you through electronic machines trying to do harm financial or otherwise\nSo we're doing this with them we work with the attorney general's office to and Jim can speak a little bit more about that\nUm but we also have something called the fraud watch network and it's it's a free thing it doesn't have to only be for a A R P members it's for anybody but we have you know several hundred thousand members and New Hampshire so what we do\nIs we people who joined us network can actually go in and they can report they're frauds and scams and you can actually see in real time in New Hampshire what's happening and where you when you say go in you mean online online they can go online I may go people don't have access to computers male people don't but that's another point I mean this is\nYou know an FTC Federal Trade commission study came out and early Eighteen and and actually\nYou know people who are younger than fifty were more likely to be built than people over fifty and because there was an optimism bias they figured they wouldn't be scammed now\nI'm older people were hit for more money probably because they have more money to lose in many cases but it doesn't just hit older people so I don't want the younger listeners to think this is only a problem for your mothers and fathers or your grandparents because\nThe numbers were really high I'm so anyways ... with the whole idea is giving people a sense of where to go so we've given some good information the local police department safe place charitable trust human safe place attorney general's office safe place fraud worked ... network safe place\nThree three places but but it's too late if you've already acted and you've given the money\nYeah and all those resources you know if you're driving down the road and didn't catch that we've got lots on our website when H. P. R. dot org slash exchange our producer and grim put us at the links and information if you didn't catch all the information it's therefore you on the website did you jump into attorney but Sadie on sort of how you can hit back against is\nSo ah again I think I'm calling somebody that you can trust call your local police department and the first instance call it was an officer there who will listen to that call the uh the agency's hotline can I get that number ... sure so it's eight eight eight four six eight\nFour for five for the\nCall a a pie called the bureau of elderly an adult services in New Hampshire all those people there and can help and talk you through it\nAh and we have a unit at the age of ... office just dedicated to elder fraud and abuse and so there are people there that will will help you and try and uh and see if this is a case that we could actually prosecute 'cause that's the end of it for us that's the end of the day we'd like to be able to catch these people if we can and prosecute them to the full extent of\nLaw and gave up the phone number put that on our website to just in case folks didn't write it down go ahead Todd real quick and it'll go back to our listeners\nSure and I have another one too it's the A R P fraud watch network help lines so you can call in and this is um it's a slightly broader scope so it could be national maybe somebody's visiting somebody in Maryland maybe they're out of town that's one eight seven seven nine zero eight thirty three sixty eight seven seven nine zero eight thirty three sixty\nAnd you can talk to somebody you know again if you're a person is concerned about\nUm being judged or losing your independence that might be an opportunity for you to take matters into your own hands\nBut but not not in the ether\nOkay let's go back to our listeners and Alex sent us an email who says\nI've been working in the banking industry here in New Hampshire for almost a decade and have to say I'm always impressed how often branch employees are detecting these scans and stopping people who have fallen into the ether from sending money on multiple occasions Alex says we have deterred people from wiring money\nKnow or have stopped and spoken to customers before they get ready to mail their life savings wow in cash to scammers alec says we stop these transactions by talking to our customers and having a genuine relationship Alex wow that's great that's good for your the role of local bankers joined jumping attorney but\nThey look like exactly right and we've done a lot of work with the New Hampshire Bankers Association they have been terrific\nAnd so they're training tellers to to identify fraud that's the right there so you have an elderly person who's coming in with with a stranger or the interactions seems a little odd or they're withdrawing large amounts of money they have in many cases they have stepped in and they have stopped really bad things from happening\nBut here's another email came in from Glen my dad was scanned last year the age of eighty eight he's very embarrassed they told him his grandson was in a car crash and broke his nose in the hospital needed nine thousand Glenn that's exactly what happened\nTo my dad or Glenn says he bought gift cards and lost the money before he thought to call my sister my dad has always been Sadie with money and a good investor he is completely in the dark about the way the world is changing Glen I'm so sorry to hear what happened to your dad um if it's any comfort it sounds like he's absolutely\nNot alone um let's take another call this is Paul and Charlestown go ahead Paul you're on the air welcome\nThank you I was wondering about the calls come in claiming to be from an officer of the police department either local or state word are asking for money for some police related a function or organization or charity\nAnd how do you know whether you're getting in fact a call from a police officer\nWell Paul I really appreciate this call I myself have gotten those calls you know ... ... firefighters it's a fundraiser yeah what about that the officer a gallon\nYes so um I work for the Hudson police department they may do our union does fundraising we hire and outside company 'cause it's against the law for us to collect money I'm so if you do get those phone calls and your curious if it's legitimate or not\nCall the police department they will know about the fundraiser that's ongoing and they usually have a point of contact from the police department who will ... call you back and let you know the details of the fundraising or whatnot if you ever had have that feeling that something's just not right don't give them any call the police department\nAnd say are you guys in the midst of a hat or anything and pain outlined out okay Paul I'm sure it's a question a lot of people had um did you want a jumping on that taught or an earlier point\nSure just on the misery in company point um every two seconds every two seconds a con artist deal someone's identity and last year alone Eighteen billion dollars was lost scammers so these these folks who are listening and who maybe I've been been the victims they're not alone there's there's lots of people who were in the same boat\nHer about another type of scam actually to other types of scams I just want to throw up there so that folks listening are aware of these um one is um from information it's very easy to get some criminals will see funeral notice is in the paper\nGo to the funeral and pose as a person that the deceased owed money to have you guys heard of this one this is just I'm just wondering how low people can go\n[laughter] I'm Glad to say a world that I have not her okay and I've read about it but it's not something that I've seen you put it to between journalism and I've heard about the romance scam now what is that a turning pathetic that is one that we deal with unfortunately a lot and I think this is one of the most insidious of the scams because\nThe the scammer spends a huge amount of time a nurturing grooming a relationship with a person a of any age but often times it's someone again who is isolated\nWell and they just develop a relationship this is a very long term kind of a scam and eventually they ask for money and ah because they have to the ... the traveling overseas or they're they're in France and they need to come in and they need to pay for certain costs than fees", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "25"}
