Clark has as mentioned this is a problem in terms of regulation I Know that I I sometimes use air being be myself to to stay a places and\nI'm a lot of times it's like a a person renting out or you know to see my daughter in Washington DC and there's somebody\nOh renting out five different rooms\nThat I don't even know they live there anymore um they can get ... you know about a thousand dollars a night if you're\nGoing out of ... a couple of hundred a room um and uh\nCompared to you can charge rent for that even in Washington DC [laughter] so it is a lot more profitable if you can get them filled up and if you want to do that and uh and there is a big crisis and um and affordable housing I think you're being be contributing to it\nAnd that's why some cities right Bob around the country have started imposing restrictions on air being beat what are you hearing there\nUm there are some some ... are not New Hampshire so much but other places are saying that the owner has to actually be there um you can kind of rent it out or if it's like running as a motel that has to be regulated as a motel\nThere are some um bills here um I have not gone anywhere that have said that they are being used to be license and uh and compete with other um there's a notice store thing about taxes\nAnd I'm from Massachusetts General hospital using research to develop treatments for complex conditions all the help their patients get back to their lives Mass General\nRevolutionizing care while he was some showers today high temperatures in the fifties cloudy showers this evening clearing in the overnight lows tonight upper thirties to mid forties [noise] this is an HBO or\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... today is more cities around the country put restrictions on air B. and B.\nWe're gauging the pros and cons here in the Granite State from the tourism economy to local housing markets let's hear from you send email to exchange it and H.

[laughter] well richer it's good to hear from\nYou and again our number one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven email exchange at an H. P. R. dot org so Bob who is a typical host here in New Hampshire\nWhere a typical host is still your typical hosts as a person living but that is changing living in the property living in the property but that has been changing and the percentage of their being bees that are are there ... or at least according to one study and it is a couple of years old but it has\nAh been shifting to more of a commercial enterprise show that even though most er\nAre still that way a lot of the money is now going to apps and the owners\nWell it's interesting and definitely the profile that are being be puts out there is if you know this kind of an elderly couple who just has this big house and you know they need to rent out a couple of rooms and make some money and the rooms are empty 'cause the kids are grown our producer Christina Philips talk with Elaine a listener who does rent rooms in her Hopkins in home an air being be\nAnd a link to Christina how she became a host\nUm her story I think is typical for a lot of New Hampshire hosts let's hear\nOur children are grown and it's a fairly large house but it's also an older house and I'm Seventeen Seventy nine in fact [noise]\nAnd it does seem like an ideal setting for an herb ... situation so I'm thinking cord retirement I thought well experiment a little bit and\nJust kind of see what comes of it and see if it might be something that could supplement an income [noise] so and and make sure it wasn't going to be an overwhelming amount of work so that's really how I got started\nAgain that's a lane a listener who rents up rooms in her Hopkins in home so lord that's the image that we have of this you know nice older person who just wants to make a little extra cash from those empty rooms\nYeah and I I'm sure that there are probably several properties like that um\nI I'm not you know I Can't say exactly how many people actually are in their homes or in the area it seems like the majority are more of the vacant homes where people rent them for\nYou know a week at a time um you know a month at a time even so if if that's the case um what were kind of seeing is that more people are coming up and they're using it\nSort of like a hotel but usually for more of an extended period of time or they have a lot of people and they want to stay altogether I'm so we see more house rentals\nOr which is great because you know there's again there there's pros and cons you know and the hotel we don't have full kitchen so if you want to stay somewhere and you want to watch your budget and make your meals or even if you just want to do it as a family type you know activity cooking in the kitchen [noise]\nUm we can't offer that but at home can so what we have seen\nIs is more of that type of um\nGroup coming in that it is like a big family maybe they're in for a wedding maybe they're in for a week at a time um and they're still younger crowd to that they're looking for something that's a little more budget friendly um which\nMaybe maybe not but um it it is it it does seem to kind of run the gamut of all different types with all different kind of aspects of what they want out of their vacations\nWhelan Amy the impression that you get you know when you read and talk to people is I'm very few people have a problem with you know people like that listener Elaine who rent out a couple of spare rooms in her big old farmhouse but some people's backs to kinda get up when they think about\nSomeone coming in buying up five apartments that would have gone to residents of will spur oh for example I'm burning now being rented out on air being be and you know people kinda go oh I don't like that on the other hand the free market\nCapitalist economy people can buy property and do whatever they want with it right so should we really have a problem with corporate air B. and B. rentals [noise]\nAgain I think it also goes back to that balance um because you have this older person renting a room out of their house and they're bringing in income um however um they're also bed and breakfast country ends in ... that have rooms for rent and this person not with their\nRegulations the same tax says the same licensing licensing\nThat we expect of our country ends in bed and breakfast and hotels and so is it a fair market you know and the the prices are going to be less that goes back to kind of the same thing with ... burn taxi drivers you know ... or less because they don't have the same tax it's licensing regulations\nAnd so they can undercut the market but again we need to also protect those that are paying in our taxes and and having to be mandated by the state on regulations in and licensing and they're hardworking property owners that we need to protect as well because they are the backbone of our economy\nHim from St Joseph hospital now she was a member of covenant helps specializing in breast health inexperience in partnering with women on their health need to\nLearn more

I guess the mother in law house or whatever you call it a but it was a separate place and the people or ride down the block and when we came in they they built a little fire forest collected would\nYou know I mean it's very nice you know they you know and they did show us everything but they weren't there they weren't we weren't renting a room in their house so it's it's a\nIt is very diverse is nice when you can be with the owner but I I found that actually that's usually not the majority of the cases are so so it's a\n... the more the case if you're familiar with Bob are just you know again somebody bought the place up not really sure who they are but you know somehow you get in there\nRight a lot of times we never meet at one time we we went police and we were supposed to be get a key in the lock box in the person didn't put the key in the lock box and we were waiting and you know eleven o'clock at night and a neighborhood in Washington DC that we wouldn't want to be hanging out and [laughter] so they have those problems\nI had a similar experience that in Montreal so anyway we could all share stories and um I Want to invite again jak cutty on with us again jak is executive director the mount Washington valley economic council good morning jak thanks for being with us\nLike for the a ... year to talk about this subject to important a sporting issue in the Washington as\nWell and you told us in an interview earlier this summer on our going local series that um you were worried that air being babies affecting your regions housing market tell us a little bit more about that a jak\nSure I'm ... the situation is ... or ... or something like that than unintended consequences and uh the situation in the mall Washington salary is that ...\nI waited years I'm In the in the valley or not that that high and so affordable housing for first time homebuyers\nAre a ... a very low and was what's happening is that the market um\nPeople from outside of the area um want to buy a second home and instead of\nHaving 'em in the competition is between the second homeowner and the the ... you know the young residents first time homebuyers and what happens there's the the ... the second homeowners beat out the first time homebuyers because it's been a lot of that's just a cash\nThey're the ones that are entering a wouldn't lose the opportunity to purchase\nThese that's always been the case though jak hasn't it that you know second homes are are a force in several areas of New Hampshire so how was this really different from the second home market that people complained about for a long time you know taking a housing for year round residents\nAlone what happened was well then the the situation is is that\nThe um the second homeowner now is used in the European be opportunities to um provide housing for visitors to the valley and most of these houses are and residential neighborhoods\nSo when there's an abused of the number of people that are staring at the European be\nIt has an impact on the surrounding neighbors are wearing it to that problem also\nSo what kinds of changes would you like to see jak our guests have talked about a communities elsewhere and how they've you know impose different requirements or discussed different requirements so I Wonder what you would like to see happen in the mount Washington rally\nWell that's a good question and this is my thought on that I don't think landowners should be federalized for their their use it's their land it's their property however I think that the\nState of New Hampshire the deer and should be looking at opportunities or allowing towns where there were the origin issue to be able to give a\nCommercial property owner a seasonal rental or wherever the opportunity if they're willing to do a shock the long term rental service shock tremor does actually get maybe a credit on their checks the property tax bill um for doing that\nSo instead of imposing a restriction you create an incentive for people to open up their property to long term housing\nExactly which I think would be much at the impact on the ... probably would be\nMinimal and the um what you're doing that as you're saying um okay fine if you're we want to give you a ... ... reward for being able to provide housing for the workforce and the horses out okay or other other towns in the states that are running in ...\nWhich I can really appreciate you being with us thanks a lot that's jak cutting again executive director of the mount Washington valley\nEconomic council um well let's bring you in on this as well you know we're wrestling with this because you know if you buy a property we do have property rights in this country um what about the idea of instead of saying you can't do this you have an incentive\nTo keep your property open to um to long term rentals to residents to workers\nYeah I mean I think that's a fantastic idea um anything that you can incentivize versus tantalizing seems to usually do matter for most people [noise]\nUm and I think that would be kind of nice that that would hopefully maybe open some of that property back on to people that are looking for a long term rentals versus\nYou know running into this massive shortage of um you know the it small apartments or actual homes you know it's not just rental property it's actual um for sale property so\nOr anything that I think helps that would be big not only for\nA folks looking to either relocate or just purchased a property or you know if they're living with their families you know move out on their own into rental property but then that also helps I think impact businesses that are looking to draw you know workers from around the state because again if you have a house\nDifficult to bring in a good people to work and that that's kind of across the board we've seen that\nA lot not just that our property but at all the businesses around in town we've talked to them um there has been a shortage of employees and you know you can't necessarily pinpoint and [noise] you know blame it all on on one thing or a shortage in housing but that definitely contributes to Palin doesn't help threat they're saying\nWell and here's a great question from Fran in Nashua who says\nOther than the digital infrastructure and making it easier for government organizations to track what is the difference friend asks between between ... transactions and the real estate rental sections of the old one ad catalogs my parents used\nUsed to use to find cottages to rent for

Clark has as mentioned this is a problem in terms of regulation I Know that I I sometimes use air being be myself to to stay a places and\nI'm a lot of times it's like a a person renting out or you know to see my daughter in Washington DC and there's somebody\nOh renting out five different rooms\nThat I don't even know if they live there anymore um they can get your nose fire you know about a thousand dollars a night if you're\nGoing out of ... a couple of hundred a room um and uh\nCompared to you can charge rent for that even in Washington DC [laughter] so it is a lot more profitable if you can get them filled up and if you want to do that and uh and there is a big crisis and um and affordable housing and I think you're being be is contributing to it\nAnd that's why some cities right Bob around the country have started imposing restrictions on air being beat what are you hearing there\nUm there are some some ... are not New Hampshire so much but other places are saying that the owner has to actually be there um you can kind of rent it out or if it's like running as a motel that has to be regulated as a motel\nThere are some um bills here um I have not gone anywhere that have said that they are being used to be license and uh and compete with other um there's a notice store thing about taxes and whether they're paying their share of taxes out of go into that a little bit\nI'm from St Charles was hospital now show a member of covered in health specializing in breast health experience in partnering with women on their health needs more and more in the euro best you can age ... or [noise]\nThis is at age we are\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... today is more cities around the country put restrictions on air B. and B.\nWe're gauging the pros and cons here in the Granite State from the tourism economy to local housing markets let's hear from you send email to exchange it and H.

[laughter] well richer it's good\nTo hear from you and again our number one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven email exchange at an H. P. R. dot org so Bob who is a typical host here in New Hampshire\nWhere a typical host is still your typical hoses a person living but that is changing living in the property living in the property but that has been changing and the percentage of their being bees that are\nAre there are at least according to one study and it is a couple of years old but it it has ah been shifting to more of a commercial enterprise so that\nEven though most are still\nUm are still that way a lot of the money is now going to apps and the owners\nWell it's interesting and definitely the profile that are being be puts out there is it's you know this kind of an elderly couple who just has this big house and you know they need to rent out a couple of rooms and make some money and the rooms are empty 'cause the kids are grown our producer Christina Phillips talked with a lane a listener who does rent rooms in her Hopkins in home an air being be\nAnd a link to Christina how she became a host\nUm her story I think is typical for a lot of New Hampshire hosts let's hear\nOur children are grown and it's a fairly large house but it's also an older house and I'm Seventeen Seventy nine in fact\nAnd it did seem like an ideal setting for an herb in the situation so I'm thinking cord retirement I thought well I'll experiment a little bit and\nJust kind of see what comes of it and see if it might be something that could supplement and income [noise] so and and make sure it wasn't going to be an overwhelming amount of work so that's really how I got started\nThat's a lane a listener who rents out rooms in her Huffington home so lord that's the image that we have of this you know\nFrom those empty rooms\nYeah and I I'm sure that there are probably several properties like that um\nI I'm not you know I Can't say exactly how many people\nActually are in their homes or in the area it seems like the majority are more of the vacant homes where people rent them for a week at a time um you know a month at a time even so if if that's the case um what were kind of seeing is that more people are coming up\nAnd they're using it sort of like a hotel but usually for more of an extended period of time or they have a lot of people and they want to stay altogether I'm so we see more house rentals\nAh which is great because you know there's again there there's pros and cons you know in the hotel we don't have full kitchen so if you want to stay somewhere and you want to watch your budget and make your meals or even if you just want to do it as a family type you know activity cooking in the kitchen [noise]\nUm we can't offer that but at home can so what we have seen\nIs is more of that type of um\nGroup coming in that it is like a big family maybe they're in for a wedding maybe there and for a week at a time um and they're still younger crowd to that they're looking for something that's a little more budget friendly um which\nMaybe maybe not but um it it is it it it does seem to kind of run the gamut of all different types with all different kind of aspects of what they want out of their vacations\nWhelan Amy the impression that you get you know when you read and talk to people is I'm very few people have a problem with you know people like that listener Elaine who rent out a couple of spare rooms in her big old farmhouse but some people's backs do kind of get up when they think about\nSomeone coming in buying up five apartments that would have gone to residents of wills Perot for example I'm burning now being rent it out on air being be and you know people kinda go oh I don't like that on the other hand it's a free market\nCapitalist economy people can buy property and do whatever they want with it right so should we really have a problem with corporate Caribbean be rentals [noise] again I think it also goes\nBack to that balance um because you have this older person renting a room out of their house and they're bringing in income um however\nUm they're also bed and breakfast country ends and Hopkins ... that have rooms for rent\nAnd this person not with their air being be they don't have the same regulations that same taxes the same licensing licensing that we expect of our country ends in bed and breakfast and hotels\nAnd so is it a fair market you know and the the prices are going to be less it goes back to kind of the same thing with ... burn taxi drivers you know ... or less because they don't have the same tax as licensing regulations\nAnd so they can undercut the market but again we need to also protect those that are paying in our taxes and and having to be mandated by the state on regulations in and licensing and they're hardworking property owners that we need to protect as well because they are the backbone of our economy\nFoundation support or cross wrote an age ...

looking back to the exchange good to have you\nJackie with us\nOkay Jack ... are you on the air with us\nAll right we seem to be having a Monday morning phone line I'm with jak cutting and that's fine hopefully we'll get him back soon lots of comments coming in on Facebook and through email and on Facebook says the people that I Know who do this do it to help pay high property taxes they take pride in their home and his base they offer\nThe people who stay there really love staying where owner onsite can give them info on where to eat hike shop at sat around so um but that's the kind of you know I'm host that are being the likes to promote you know this is the local owner and they're going to you know put their arm around you and show you where to go\nWell you know and Barbara is uh is is not actually staying at the place of love previous caller but she was a renting a house right next door so she's there so again this definition of what the owner is and and what's an absence\nCan watch or just someone renting out a room uh we've stayed in a place actually it was in Ireland where um it was just the I guess the mother in law house or whatever you call it a but it was a separate place and the people or ride down the block and when we came in they they built a little fire for us collectively would\nYou know I mean it's very nice you know they you know and they did show us everything but they weren't there they weren't we weren't renting a room in their house so it's it's a\nIt is very different is nice when you can be with the owner but I I found that actually that's usually not the majority of the cases are so so it's a\n... that more of the cases that you're familiar with Bob are just you know again somebody bought the place up not really sure who they are but you know somehow you get in there\nRight a lot of times we never meet at one time we we went police and we were supposed to be get a key in the lock box in the person didn't put the key in the lock box and we were waiting and you know eleven o'clock at night in a neighborhood in Washington DC that we wouldn't want to be hanging out and [laughter] so they have those problems\nI had a similar experience that in Montreal so anyway we can all share stories and um I Want to invite again jak cutty on with us again jak is executive director the mount Washington valley economic council good morning jak thanks for being with us\nLike Florida or the or a ... year to talk about this subject to important a sporting issue in the Washington about as\nWell and you told us in an interview earlier this summer on our going local series that um you were worried that air being beat was affecting your regions housing market tell us a little bit more about that jak\nSure um their situation is ... or ... or something good but there unintended consequences and uh the situation in the mall Washington salary is that ... our wages I'm In the in the valley or not that\nThat high and so affordable housing for first time homebuyers\nAre a ... and the majority is very low and was what's happening is the mark here um people from outside of the area um want to buy a second home and instead of having 'em\nAnd the competition is between the second homeowner and the the ... you know the young residents first time homebuyers and or what happens is the the ... the second homeowners beat out the first time homebuyers because of them a lot of it's just the cash still sure and so\nThey're the ones that are renting out a winning the the opportunity to purchase\nThese that's always been the case though jak hasn't it that you know second homes are are a force in several areas of New Hampshire so how is this really different from the second home market that people complained about for a long time you know taking a housing for year round residents\nYeah well what happened was ... ... you got the situation is is that\nThe um the second homeowner now is used in the European be opportunities to um provide housing for visitors to the valley and most of these houses are in residential neighborhoods\nSo when there's an abused of the number of people that are staying at the European be it has an impact on the surrounding neighbors that were running into that problem also\nSo what kinds of changes would you like to see jak guard gas have talked about a communities elsewhere and how they've you know impose different requirements or discussed different requirements so I Wonder what you would like to see happen in the mount Washington rally\nWell that's a good question and this is my thought on that I don't think landowners\nThey're huge it's their land it's their property however I think that the state of New Hampshire the deer and should be looking at opportunities or allowing columns where there were the origin issue to be able to do a\nCommercial property owner of seasonal rental or whatever the opportunity if they're willing to do a shock to the long term rental service shock tremor does actually get maybe a credit on their checks the property tax bill um for doing\nSo instead of imposing a restriction you create an incentive for people to open up their property to long term housing\nExactly which I think would be much at the impact on the tax roles probably would be minimal and the um what you're doing that as you're saying I'm\nUp here to find a cure we want to give you a ... ... reward for being able to provide housing for the work force and the horses out okay or other other towns in on this to run against ...\nWill jak really appreciate you being with us thanks a lot that's jak cutting again executive director of the mount Washington valley economic council um well let's bring you in on this as well you know we're wrestling with this because you know if you buy a property we do have property rights in this country\nUm what about the idea of instead of saying you can't do this you have an incentive to keep your property open to um to long term rentals to residents to workers\nYeah I mean I think that's a fantastic idea um anything that you can incentivize versus tantalizing ah seems to usually do matter for most people\nUm and I think that would be kind of nice that that would hopefully maybe open some of that property back up to people that are looking for long term rentals versus\nYou know running into this massive shortage of um you know be at small apartments or actual homes you know it's not just rental property it's actual um for sale property so\nOr anything that I think helps that would be big not only for\nA folks looking to either relocate or just purchase a property or you know if they're living with their families you know move out on their own into a rental property but then that also helps I think impact businesses that are looking to draw\nYou know workers from around the state because again if you have a housing shortage\nThat makes it very difficult to bring in a good people to work in that that's kind of across the board we've seen that a lot not just that our property but at\nAll the businesses around in town we've talked to them um there has been a shortage of employees and you know you can't necessarily pinpoint and you know blame it all on on one thing or a shortage and housing but that definitely contributes to shadow of housing\nDoesn't help right there saying well and here's a a great question from Fran in Nashua who says other than the digital infrastructure and making it easier for government organizations to track what is the difference friend asks between between ... and be transactions and the real estate rentals sections of the old one ad catalogs my parents used\nUsed to use to find cottages to rent for cheaper than hotels and bed and breakfasts back in the eighties and friend it's a great question and\nI don't know if you want to take that first Damien you Bob as well I mean we've always had short term rentals we've always had sort of\nI own this cabin and the lakes region so I'm going to rent it out except for the two weeks that I Want to go there myself so what's the difference really", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "city":
