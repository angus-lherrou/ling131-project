H. P. R. dot org\nIt's gone on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange or give us a call one eight hundred\nEight nine to six or seven seven\nAnd a Jason just before the break I was giving you a chance to respond to Leonard's concern he feels like the restrictions on beaches on his pond or too tough I'm On the other hand he says the town doesn't restrict you know sort of um water running off the roads and and being dumped in the pond as well and the roads being assaulted in the winter\nJust a touch on the on the beach peace I'm under ... or send can be replenished up to ... cubic yards every six years with the ... through the permitting process though Diaz is looking at a construction of the beach in it making recommendations on how to better routine that soon on land in the future\nBased activities that that ... that occur um the shoreline protection are just looking at impervious surfaces certainly um I mean you know payments have been where water is not allowed to smoke and all those services that can't absorb a a rain event\nUm and so really all land base activities do you do put pose some some threat or or harm to to water quality\nSo not get too technical on the air but um you know I've read again people making the complaint that Leonard makes how far back do you go I mean if I live\nI don't know a quarter mile from a big lake or an eighth of a mile from a big lake um I'll Try to first estimate anybody jump in does my land usage get caught up in the shoreline Protection Act if I don't live right on the shore land but I live close\nBy sure of great question the the stroller Protection Act extends to two hundred and fifty feet Lambert roughly from from the water's edge that doesn't sound like very much\nIt it's a fair amount you've now um but it's also important to recognize that the shoreline Protection Act isn't just a law that's looking to protect trees there's real Protection Act is looking at\nA like a ... a moment ago impervious surfaces low surfaces that can't absorb storm water because impervious services have the tendency to concentrate storm water which in turn has negative effects of water quality\nSo looking at it that area of two hundred and fifty feet to the ones which were patrolling protection are looking at\nGetting a better handle on her on her impervious services and also in addition to keeping a will distribute standard trees but better managing the storm water that is associated with those impervious services do you want to jump in a ...\nYeah well I think that um we don't want to miss the important point that uh because of our state the state mission in the lens around our lakes\nUm anything we do as I said a ... on any of that landscape that is a contributing area to run office is going to have an impact it just that the Charlotte area is the last area in terms that we can we can catch it and\nUm we are dealing with there are laws that are they're our stormwater laws and and different types of drainage laws and things like that that that impacts developments away from the shore land\nUm the the most critical thing is that where every everything we try to do we're trying to minimize the creation of this run off and we're trying to minimize the flow we're trying to spread out\nSo that it it can actually get back into the ground before it gets to receive and water and um so that that's what we're looking at but if you're a show on property and you're getting drainage coming off of the road that you're on\nYour driveway or that goes into a boat ramp your sense of giving it at all that stuff that generated above you a pathway to get into the er the lake and and that's definitely not good for what's going on\nA little bit later I Want to ask you how much development roads as well as homes um\nIs grandfathered into this law because there's a lot of old homes and I'm thinking of a lake that I go to every year and there's a road right by the lake um\nSo I Want to ask you guys about that in a moment but I Want to go down to the lake level in our conversation and let's bring in\nMitch Elias and she's been working on like centipede for many years she's a resident there longtime citizen scientists steward of the lake where she's been collecting water samples and Mitch really nice to have you so you've been testing like somebody's letters for a little more than a decade now is that right\nYes thank you um I have been taken daily samples for a little more than a decade but I've also been involved in another monitoring program that actually cash washed started years ago and I've been doing that for making twenty\nMonthly fat phone daily samples so I'm picturing image you know cutting a hole in the ice and ... and October okay [laughter]\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked ... in your community was convenient locations throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think there's a dark myth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nDorms Hitchcock is here\nSo it's just the growth of this cyanobacteria and in order to do that we really found that taking weekly collection wasn't enough we really need to know how this presents sort of fluctuating from day to day\nIn Santa bacteria is the nasty stuff that can make you sick and you can ask those judge that\nYou know can create a green scum and you know there's a lot of research into it but it's health effects are but you know it's not a sign of a healthy like when it gets out of balance which is what's been happening on many of our lakes\nSo what have you found about leaks Sanofi in terms of what\nWe've found that um the cyanobacteria ms actually been pressing on in like ... feet back into the Eighteen forties they've looked at sediment from the lake bottom to figure that out and uh it but it has been more prevalent over the past\nTen twelve years than in the prior years and we're trying to figure out why it's out of balance\nAnd yeah so there's been an increase in Santa bacteria and that's since shuttered down the signs of not just residents of New Hampshire but people who work in the tourism industry because our lakes are so important um such an important tourism or what have you seen manage in your years I'm On the lake and studying the lake in terms of short land development\nWell then obviously increase the um ... there's been a sort of aesthetic change\nAs get little summer camp so they're sort of you know cut out of them would have become much more um substantial year round houses and there's been a\nAnesthetic change in\nThe kind of landscaping that goes on along the shoreline you know it used to be that you sort of cut a little path down to a dock\nAnd a little view and now it tends to be a lot more sort of wide open broad lawns big granted staircase steps down that her and pervious that kind of change\nSo how do you feel about that I mean I Know you sound disappointed but we're talking about the shoreline Protection Act I'm Wondering why they surely Protection Act doesn't prevent these big giant lawns that you know I can ... bacteria yeah go ahead\nExcuse me I think that they surely and Protection Act really attempts to um keep that kind of change tamped down\nI'm I'm not sure it's really observed I think that there is a lot of sort of creeping change\nThat you know is not necessarily permitted or you know it's sort of well I if I just cut down one more tree on my property is not going to make any difference but\nWho's going to notice humid a lot of the fact of that attitude makes a lot of change\nWow so what do you want to see happen Mitch\nLike to see I'd like to see the act more enforced I'd like to see 'em you know I think that's a very difficult thing for de yes they do paperwork processing but they are on the lake\nIt falls back to the town the town have various levels and the ability to go out and actually see what's happening on the land and too often you know things sort of go along a little on check\nRat on their neighbor but the cumulative effect as part of this crazy thing development that's beyond what the shore land jak Hoekstra see\nI have read Mitch that um after the legislature dial back the shoreline Protection Act that some lakeside towns amped up their own ordinances what about your town\nI Would say definitely I have property in both on the New London and I think they have both tried to sort of fill a gap and keep things you know a little a little tighter and a little more control but they also do not have the manpower to watch what's happening\nLearn more North Atlantic fuels dot com\nOr at least mostly cloudy today chances some showers southern areas of the state because see some sunshine in the afternoon high temperatures in the ...\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... tomorrow night show we sit down with New Hampshire fish and game executive director Glenn Norman do send us your questions for directing Norman do in advance of the show if you'd like exchange\nAt an H. P. R. dot org and it'd be sure to join us tomorrow morning live at nine this hour we're revisiting the short land Protection Act aimed at keeping New Hampshire's water bodies clean\nBut still the subject of some confusion and controversy let's hear from you on this send us an email exchange at an H. P. R. dot org Facebook or Twitter is an HBO exchange our phone number is one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven so Jason just before the break we hear from Jerry in freedom who said he feels like the show that Protection Act\nIsn't followed closely enough isn't tough enough he said you know people just\nThen you know ... the next day and you were saying not that\nNo that's not the case in ... and what I was saying was that you know the department's first approaches to is to get a restoration plan for the property on or develop British show us how the um the certain areas will be restored to the minimum standards I also wanted to touch on um you know starting for Memorial Day weekend we receive\nHundreds of complaints throughout the summer and what we're finding is oftentimes what folks perceived to be\nI'm a U.S really egregious a significant violation of the shoreline Protection Act turns out that the folks actually did obtaining surely a permit and the project I'm occurred as permitted example is right you're talking about\nA great example is ah looking from say a bird's eye view of the property I'm as the shoreline Protection Act has written today Seventy five percent of the area that exist safe from fifty feet to a hundred and fifty feet land where it can be clear cut today\nIn from afar that looks really aggressive in in it appears to be a violation of of the shoreline Protection Act\nTurns out it's not um so a new home could be constructed a new law it can be constructed provided doesn't encroach\nCloser than fifty feet to the water's edge um you may see a new lawn or all all very permissible under the shoreline Protection Act today looks aggressive from afar but um is often a very legal what do you think to\nSee in that instance would someone who's done has taken a twenty five percent remaining vegetation and split it in half and left a twelve and a half percent of visual barrier on the sideline and this is where the they have virtually Seventy five percent of the profit\nOkay literally left the numbers that can you just explain that a little bit more hands on aid for like\nA miniature bowling alley as I mentioned earlier yeah with the remaining vegetation is strictly on the sidelines and at the center part of the property and often I'm very steep slopes so that it had\nA certainly because then you don't have this roughness associated with the natural shrubs and enforced\nBuffer that's going to slow watered down and let it infiltrate so these roadways that a back of the property of the outside of the property that may contribute water through the property to the lake on slowed down as a result of that so that that vegetative buffers what we're trying to retain its when we talk about enforcement\nOf a big part of it is that the laws isn't in the standards for my work and do or perhaps when when the spirit of those laws are met if people are trying to figure out a way around and I'm like so many laws then we end up with this this\nBowling alley if you will where people are still ... the standard so we strongly encourage naturally strongly encourages me ... all these local communities to take matters into their own hands if they value their legs that much more than say a state wide legislative processes will will set\nThen determine those standards for themselves we work very aggressively locally to help people do that\nThat's interesting I got an email to that point that I have a minute but I can see like I think I just wanted to say something we say we seem\nTo be pounding on line and there there there are kind of good lines in bad loans that belongs that we don't want to see the ones like the hundred percent Kentucky bluegrass where there's really no benefit that we're getting and we're having to put down and highlights of nutrients from actually add water to the system\nUm there are there are lots of different ... and rice and things like that at that time ... different types of species of grasses that that that mixes that are specifically designed for this area that can be that are low maintenance like that can be grown in and and I are fine as part of the landscape that would be on a show on property\nOkay and spoken like a landscaper who knows what you should plant and let you shouldn't but to\nA bull ordinances a versus\nThe um the state laws uh we got an email to this effect I'm from someone who says you know he doesn't think municipalities should be putting in their um their own laws Rogers says I served in my local zoning board the shoreline Protection Act he says allows municipalities be more receptive\nThan the Protection Act provides for\nGiven that the Protection Act is comprehensive and based in science Rogers says what is the rationale for allowing municipalities to be more restrictive I'm so Tom your thoughts first but anybody else can jumping should\nI mean the way it works from statutory standpoint is that it's enabling legislation and under which and along with many other parts of law cities and towns can enact more restrictive witnesses is their right to do\nAnd I think the the thing with the Shirley water quality Protection Act is a standard shoes I Would respectfully disagree with the with the caller the emailer that in fact they are having the desired effect\nIf people meet them in a way to that are also understand how they're protective water quality and have that same vision of the same intent or perhaps they can be sufficiently protective\nOf what we've seen in reality is that remove all the vegetation is occurring in such a way that complies with the letter of the standards so the water quality Protection Act\nFor not protective of water qualities plain and simple so the evidence is pretty clear on the landscape and we just simply say the towns have the right to particularly when you think atomic wolf or thirty percent of the tax lodge have waterfront property those tax laws to provide over sixty percent of the property tax income\nSo how'd the links go so goes that town and that's when we want to so many towns that are highly dependent on clean lakes and the and the economic values associated with that\nSo respectfully disagree with Roger he feels like the shoreline Protection Act is good enough and should not be supplemented by the town's you'd say ... I I disagree with that correct\nSo to the point about um towns having their own ordinances and I have read that a lot of them do does that make your job Jason a more difficult to sort of explain what this means to to people\nNo it doesn't um you know working for the department you know our our duty is to force the provisions of the shoreline Protection Act\nOr has it's written today I'm certainly in our outreach efforts we make an effort to educate everybody all stakeholders to make them cognizant of of the fact that some municipalities have much more stringent standards\nTo most of them what's your perspective on that do you think half of them do or their own do or\nIt's a much smaller maybe maybe ten ten percent really okay if that yeah but some of the big ones like well that's a lot of people and a lot and not necessarily like\nThe big ones but but I'm the seems the more progressive municipalities that seemed to recognize the value of their water and and they feel that they need to provide a a a greater level of protection to these to these resources right\nWell rounded we appreciate the email thank you you can email us as well exchange at an H. P. R. dot org again exchange at N. H. P. R. dot org you can give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven sat and here's an email from Debbie in the ... she says we have dozens of ducks and Canada geese\nLiving on the lake given the amount of excellent excrement they produce why are there no attempt to eliminate or at least limit the number of them on our lakes and that Debbie everybody wants to jump [laughter] go ahead Jeff\nThat was one of the points that I was making before in terms of what happens when you clear the land when when we have this natural shrub and forest buffer on the shores\nActually about gays which are probably the most efficient bird to pack waste that I've ever seen or if you've ever been on a on a lawn where there's there's even been a small amount of them\nI'm actually if you allow for most of your shoreline to have higher shrubs on that show land and water interface geese won't come up on to a property if they can't see over\nThe vegetation Alice how interesting it can actually keep them from going onto a won by just planting a straw buffer and you don't have to make a continuous you can actually often ate it so that you can actually walk through it by ... what you could actually you don't have to put any any chemicals down enough to do anything you won't get geese\nIf they can't see over the shrubbery so they because they're afraid of being poached from both sides from the water side and from the land side they're not going to come up on a property and that's probably the most simplest way to keep\nThose those types of birds off your property\nThat's fascinating so plant a couple of bushes and you get rid of the games\nGet some high Bush isn't there except for where you want to have that pass to get down to the water and you're not going to have these coming on your long\nWCBS Nashua eighty eight point three W.

P. R. dot org again exchange it any PR dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an age PR exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six\nOr seven seven we have three guest in Studio Tom O'Brian is here he's president of New Hampshire lakes competency uh thinking being here\nBut you for having me also with us Jason obey shoreline program outreach coordinator within half department of environmental services and address and looking back thank you for it starts ... and also with us jets lost natural resources chair at UNH cooperative extension and coauthor of the book landscaping at the water's edge\nAnd ecological approach and Jeff thank you for being here as well I really appreciate it when people are so here's the basic tension a gentleman and I'm sure you know this well New Hampshire waters belong to everyone to us the general public but the property along the water is often privately held\nSo Jeff what are some of the major priorities for sure land protection what are we worrying about what are we asking property owners to worry about\nAlarmed virtually everything that we do on the landscape will have some effect on border collie given the the slope and and the U.S the small amount of drainage or is that all are receiving waters of lake streams rivers\nOr even the ocean so um what were concerned about is that true in area is that last place that um anything can be done to kind of hold back\nAll of the different types of materials and pollutants and um and ah ah different types of floodwaters are still more income and that will\nEssentially impact the water either through water quality or by modifying the habitat of the show on which is extremely important habitat that we have a New Hampshire\nFill the shoreline Protection Act basically is the last effort to prevent gunk pollutants stuff getting into the water you know it is through a series of requirements that written you know for Bush's and trees and so forth um to slow things down\nBottom line in the best thing we can do is kind of put nature in the way of of the kind of storm runoff and things that we get a ...\nBreaking up the power of raindrops as they hit the ground in absorbing nutrients before they get to the water\nAnd love your thoughts to chase and not just that the fundamental way that the Protection Act tries to slow things down so that last stuff runs off into the water sure I\nThink Jeff touched on a nicely but really in a nutshell what you're looking at is a combination of of trees siblings are native shrubs natural ground covers that natural system that acts to intercept storm water and also provide\nI'm critical wildlife habitat as well as just maintain the natural uh aesthetic beauty over water bodies\nWhen you say I'm a storm water just to remind us what that most people now are\nA storm water you know some folks to look at it as just dirty water brown water but it it has all those agents like nitrogen phosphorus silk sediments those are the critical components that\nAre accelerate the natural aging over water bodies in ah have the tendency to significantly decrease water quality\nAnd we're seeing heavier rainstorms in recent years so it's one thing if there's a gentle rain all day right track Jason it's another thing that all of a sudden water is just jumping out of this guy kinda rushes off the pavement ...\nThat's right so we're looking at two pieces here in New Hampshire we only are we impacting our buffers by removing a lot of the natural ground coverage and trees and siblings but\nOver the last decade or so we've we're seeing an increase in store Vince to produce more than two inches of a liquid precipitation and a twenty four hour period so uh that too is\nIs having an impact on our our water quality and that's why sometimes after heavy rainstorm you try to go to your favorite lake and they said no you can't have you contaminated Sienna bacteria algae blooms and if you're going to be more than ... okay\nSo to you more broadly I think Tom O'Brian there certainly Protection Act as we said has been on the books for almost Thirty years Nineteen Ninety One how much of a difference do you think it's ...\nOr ... made a huge difference on it if if if nothing else raised awareness among landowners construction industry landscape industry real estate is industry um lake advocates about the importance of that land adjacent to leaks\nAh so I think it's the fact that there may be some creative tension around the ebb and flow of standards a relative to the cause they get dialed up or dial back\nThe proud of it it's been a learning process as a you know did the standard have the desired effect\nDid this percentage that was established for\nYou know remaining vegetation have the desired effect or did in fact people still\nCreate virtual bowling alleys of of of develop watch with us we're run off can can run unimpeded into like\nBowling alleys that's a good analogy so that just means an open smooth lane for all sorts of stuff to be dumped into the lake I think you're also referring Tom to the fact that in the almost Thirty years that this has been on the books um the legislature is kind of go back and forth on this law haven't they\nIndeed and I give them credit for the process and that is that uh there's been in multiple occasions [noise]\nA committee or commission an advisory committee a formulated\nThat has legislators that has the various ah represented some industry from like advocates from the agencies and we've worked in in in several cases for years as a shoreline devised a committee to try to sort it out um so that in fact\nThe real regulations are the standards of smart they are going to have the desired effect and the process the permitting process is is consistently and ... and we usually navigated on the proud of applicants\nAnd consistency has been a complaint\nKnow they certainly Protection Act you know says this for this case and then you know that for that case and that different owners seemed to be treated differently any consistency has been a problem with that\nYeah I I don't know about people being treated differently so much as there are certainly different conditions we have a thousand lakes in New Hampshire than the public domain and no shoreline and those those those environments uh drastically different you may have Sandy shows me a rocky shows me steep may have\nRelatively low in shallow and some folks are very different needs to recognize it as you say someone needs more accessible um access to the water does a a redound in a way to get to the water from the home of say in a wheelchair or say something is not as mobile\nSo the expectation that somehow kept entirely forested condition where they have to clamp down over rocks may not be realistic\nUh so can they make that more accessible for themselves in a way that doesn't affect water quality we think so we think that can be done and and I think frankly they can speak for the agency but they they work hard to find the results based approach\nSo uh irrespective of their respective but but as the end of the end result needs to be the what people do in the landscape doesn't have a negative effect sure\nWell and it's not it's hard to figure out 'cause people see things and they may not understand some of the subtleties show that you talk about I Want to let our listeners to join us and then there's so much more that we need to talk about again today in exchange we're revisiting the short land Protection Act and we'd love to hear from you your questions and

I'm a student can be replenished ... cubic yards every six years with the weapons permit through the permitting process though Diaz was looking at\nA construction of the beach in it making recommendations on how to better routine that soon on land in the future\nUm ... land based activities that that ... that occur um\nThe shoreline protection are just looking at impervious surfaces certainly\nUm I mean you know payments have been where water is not allowed to smoke and all those services that can't absorb a a rain event\nUm and so really all land base activities do do pose some some threat or or harm to to water quality\nSo not to get to technical on the air but um you know I've read again people making the complaint that Leonard makes how far back do you go I mean if I live\nI don't know a quarter mile from a big lake or an eighth of a mile from a big lake um I'll Try to first estimate anybody jump in does my land usage get caught up in the shoreline Protection Act if I don't live right on the shore land but I live close\nSure of great question the stroller Protection Act extends to two hundred and fifty feet Lambert roughly from from the water's edge that doesn't sound like very much\nIt it's a fair amount um but it's also important to recognize that the shoreline Protection Act isn't just a law that's looking to protect trees there's real Protection Act is looking at it\nSupport for an HBO or comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked ... in your community was convenient locations throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think is a Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nDarkness Hitchcock is here\nIn addition to keeping a will distribute students trees the better managing the storm water that is associated with those impervious services do you want to jump in and just\nYeah well I think that um we don't want to miss the important point that uh because of our state the steep mission in the lens around our lakes\nUm anything we do as I said oh come on any of that landscape that is a contributing area to run off is is going to have an impact it's just that the ... area is the last area in terms that we can we can catch it and\nUm we are dealing with there are laws that are there are still more than ... and and different types of drainage laws and things like that that that impacts developments\nAway from the shoreline um the the most critical thing is that we're ever everything we tried to do we're trying to minimize the creation of this run off and we're trying to minimize the what we're trying to spread out\nSo that it it can actually get back into the ground before it gets to receive more and I'm so that that's what we're looking at but if you're a true in property and you're getting drainage coming off of the road that you're on\nYour driveway or that goes into a boat ramp viewer simply giving it up at all that stuff that generated above you a pathway to get into the er the lake and and that's definitely not good for what's going on\nA little bit later when I was going to you how much development roads as well as homes um\nIs grandfathered into this law because there's a lot of old homes and I'm thinking of a lake that I go to every year and there's a road right by the lake um\nSo I Want to ask you guys about that in a moment but I also want to go down to the lake level in our conversation and let's bring in Mitch Eliason she's been working on Lake ... for many years she's a resident there\nAmong time citizen scientists steward of the lake which she's been collecting water samples and made a really nice to have you so you've been testing like some of these waters for a little more than a decade now is that right\nYes thank you Laura I'm I have been taking daily samples for a little more than a decade but I've also been involved in another monitoring program that actually Jeff washed started years ago and I've been doing that for maybe Twenty years\nAgo the monthly sat phone daily samples so I'm picturing humid you know cutting a hole in the ice and ... your sample you feeling turtle October okay [laughter] I could do that so what are you looking for him it\nWell I'm part of a um big scientific study that's been runs through the like to be protective association L. S. P. AIDS research director\nAnd it's looking at the presence of cyanobacteria Mm called ... in like ...\nAnd it's trying to figure out what influences the growth of this cyanobacteria and in order to do that we really found that taking weekly collection wasn't enough we really need to know how this present sort of fluctuating from day to day\nAnd Santa bacteria is the nasty stuff that can make you sick and you can is the first shot that\nYou know can create a green scum and you know there's a lot of research into it but it's health effects are but you know it's not a sign of a healthy like when it gets out of balance which is what's been happening on many there are like\nSo what have you found about lake ... in terms of ...\nWait we've found that um the cyanobacteria has actually been pressing on in like ... feet back into the Eighteen forties they've looked at sediment from the lake bottom\nUh it but it has been more prevalent over the past ten twelve years than in the prior years and we're trying to figure out why it's out of balance\nAnd yeah so there's been an increase in Santa bacteria and that sends shutters down the signs of not just residents of New Hampshire but\nPeople who work in the tourism industry because our lakes are so important such an important tourism or what have you seen manage in your years I'm On the lake and studying the lake in terms of short land development\nWell then obviously increase the um ... there's been a sort of aesthetic change\nAs get little summer camp so they're sort of you know cut out of them would have become much more um substantial year round houses and there's been a\nAnesthetic change in the kind of landscaping that goes on along the shoreline you know it used to be that you sort of cut a little path down to a dock\nAnd a little view and now it tends to be a lot more sort of wide open broad lawns big granted staircase steps down that her and pervious that kind of change\nSo how do you feel about that I mean I Know you sound disappointed but we're talking about the shoreline Protection Act\nI'm Wondering why they surely Protection Act doesn't prevent these big giant lawns that you know ... ... bacteria yeah go ahead\nExcuse me I think that they surely and Protection Act really attempts to um keep that kind of change tamped down but I'm\nI'm not sure it's really observed I think that there is a lot of sort of creeping change\nThat you know is not necessarily permitted or you know it's sort of well I if I just cut down one more tree on my property is not going to make any difference but\nWho's going to notice humid a lot of the fact of that attitude makes a lot of change\nWow so what do you want to see happen Mitch\nI'd like to see I'd like to see the act more enforced I'd like to see 'em you know I think that's a very difficult thing for de yes they do paperwork processing but they are on the lake\nIt falls back to the town the town have various levels and the ability to go out and actually see what's happening on the land and too often you know things sort of go along a little and check\nYou know like the rat on their neighbors but the cumulative effect is sort of this creeping development that's beyond what the shore land jak hopes to see\nI have read managed that um after the legislature dial back the shoreline Protection Act that some lakeside towns amped up their own ordinances what about your town\nOr I Would say definitely I have property and both son to be in New London and I think they have both tried to sort of fill a gap and keep things you know a little a little tighter and a little more control but they also do not have the manpower to watch what's happening\nAnd from Land Rover Bedford announcing their brand new Land Rover show romance state of the armed services that are had for all for South river road in Bedford more Land Rover bed for ...\nThis is an HP are\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... tomorrow night show we sit down with New Hampshire fish and game executive director Glenn Norman do send us your questions for directing Norman do in advance of the show if you'd like exchange at an H. P. R. dot org\nAnd there'd be sure to join us tomorrow morning live at nine this hour we're revisiting the short land Protection Act aimed at keeping New Hampshire's water bodies clean\nBut still the subject of some confusion and controversy let's hear from you on this send us an email exchange at an H. P. R. dot org Facebook or Twitter is an HBO exchange our phone number is one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven so Jason just before the break we hear from Jerry in freedom who said he feels like the show them Protection Act\nIsn't followed closely enough isn't tough enough he said you know people just build these big lawns and take the fine and then you know happily go out and play on the next day basically and you were saying not though\nNo that's not the case and and what I was saying was that the department's first approaches to just to get a restoration plan for the ... or develop British show us how the um certain areas will be restored to the minimum standards I also wanted to touch on um you know starting for Memorial Day weekend we receive\nHundreds of complaints throughout the summer in what we're finding is often times what folks perceived to be\nUm a really egregious a significant violation of patrolling protection it turns out that the folks actually do to obtain the shoreline permit and the project I'm occurred as permitted to sample you're talking about\nA great example is ah looking from say a bird's eye view of the property I'm as the shoreline protection or just written today Seventy five percent of the area that exists safe from fifty feet to a hundred and fifty feet landlord can be clear cut today\nIn from afar that looks really aggressive in and it appears to be a violation of of this world Protection Act\nTurns out it's not um so a new home could be constructed a new law it can be construct\nFeet to the water's edge um you may see a new lawn or all all very permissible under the shoreline Protection Act today looks aggressive from afar but um is often a very legal what do you think to\nSee in that instance with someone who's done has taken a twenty five percent remaining vegetation and split it in half and left the twelve and a half percent of visual barrier on the sideline and this is where the they have virtually Seventy five percent of the profit\nOkay literally lesson number so can you just explain that a little bit more hands on for like\nA miniature bowling alley as I mentioned earlier yeah with the remaining vegetation is strictly on the sidelines and at the center of proud of the property and often I'm very steep slopes\nSo that it had certainly because then you don't have this roughness associated with the natural shrubs and enforced\nBuffer that's going to slow watered down and let it infiltrate so these roadways or the back of the property of you know when the outside of the property that may contribute water through the property to the lake on slowed down as a result of that so that that vegetative buffers what we're trying to retain so we were talking about enforcement\nOf a big part of it is that the laws isn't in the standards might work and do or perhaps when when the spirit of those laws are met if people are trying to figure out a way around them like so many laws then we ended up with this this\nBowling alley if you will where people are still ... the standard so we strongly encourage naturally strongly encourages ... local communities to take matters into their own hands if they value their legs that much more than say a state wide legislative processes will will set\nThen determine those standards for themselves we work very aggressively locally to help people do that\nThat's interesting I got an email to that point that I shared with a minute but jak I think I just\nWanted to say something we say we seem to be pounding on lines there there there are kind of good lines in bad loans loans that we don't want to see the ones like the ... a hundred percent Kentucky bluegrass where there's really no benefit that we are getting on we're having to put down the highlights of nutrients from actually add water to the system\nUm there are there are lots of different ... and rice and things like that and that's a cute different types of species of of grasses that that that mixes that are specifically designed for this area that can be that are low maintenance like that can be grown in and and I are fine as part of the landscape that would be on a show in poverty\nOkay and spoken like a a landscaper who knows what you should plant in what you shouldn't but to your point I'm Tom about municipal ordinance says uh versus\nThe um the state live um we got an email to this a fact I'm from someone who says you know he doesn't think municipalities\nShould be putting in their ... their own lives Rogers says I served in my local zoning board the shoreline Protection Act he says allows municipalities be more receptive than the Protection Act provides for\nGiven that the Protection Act it's comprehensive and based in science Rogers says\nWhat is the rationale for allowing municipalities to be more restrictive I'm so Tom your thoughts first but anybody else can jump in\nThe short I mean the way it works from statutory standpoint is that it's enabling legislation and under which and along with many other parts of law cities and towns can enact more restrictive witnesses is their right to do\nAnd I think that the thing with the Shirley water quality Protection Act is standards that I Would respectfully disagree with the with the caller the emailer that in fact they are having the desired effect\nIf people meet them in a way to that are also understand how they're protective water quality and have that same vision of the same intent or perhaps they can be sufficiently protective of what we've seen it\nRemove all the vegetation is occurring in such a way that complies with the letter of the standards of the water quality Protection Act\nFor not protective of water qualities plain and simple so the evidence is pretty clear on the landscape and we just simply say the towns or the right to particularly when you think atomic wolf or thirty percent of the tax lots of waterfront property those tax laws to provide over sixty percent of the property tax income\nSo how'd the legs go so goes that town and that's when we want to so many towns that are highly dependent on clean lakes and the and the economic values associated with that\nTo respectfully disagree with Roger he feels like the shoreline Protection Act is good enough and should not be supplemented by the town's you'd say ... I I disagree with that correct\nSo to the point about um towns having their own ordinances and I have read that a lot of them do does that make your job Jason a more difficult to sort of explain what this means to to people\nNo it doesn't um you know working for the department you know our our duty is to force the provisions of the stroller Protection Act\nOr as it's written today\nI'm certainly in our outreach efforts we make an effort to educate everybody all stakeholders to make them cognizant of of the fact that some municipalities have much more stringent standards to most of them what's your perspective on that do you think half of them do or throw him do or\nOh it's a much smaller maybe maybe ten ten percent really okay if that yeah but some of the big ones like well that's a lot of people and a lot and not necessarily like the big ones but but I'm the seems the more progressive municipalities that seemed to recognize the value of their water\nAnd and they feel that uh they need to provide a a\nA greater level of protection to these to these resources right\nWell rounded we appreciate the email thank you you can email us as well exchange at an H. P. R. dot org again exchange at an H. P. R. dot org you can give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven sat and here's an email from Debbie in the ... she says we have dozens of ducks and Canada geese\nLiving on the lake given the amount of excellent excrement they produce why are there no attempt to eliminate or at least limit the number of them on our lakes and that Debbie everybody wants to jump [laughter] go ahead Jeff\nAll that was one of the points that I was making before in terms of what happens when you clear the land when when we have this natural\nShrug and forest buffer on the shoreline and the interesting thing especially about gays which are probably the most efficient bird to pack waste that I've ever seen or if you've ever been on a on a lawn where there's there's even been a small amount of them\nI'm actually if you allow for most of your shoreline to have higher shrubs on that show land and water interface geese won't come up on to a property if they can't see over\nThe vegetation elderly interesting can actually keep them from going onto a won by just planting a sharp buffer and you don't have to make a continuous you can actually alternate it so that you can actually walk through it ...\nWhat you could actually you don't have to put any any chemicals down enough to do anything you won't get geese if they can't see over the shrubbery so they because they're afraid of being poached from both sides from the water side and from the land side they're not going to come up on a property and that's probably the most simplest way to keep those those types of birds off your property\nThat's fascinating so plant a couple of bushes and you get rid of the games\nGet some high Bush isn't there except for where you want to have that pass to get down to the water and you're not going to have these coming on your long\nWhile and this has been a big problem in recent years right Tom for New Hampshire lakes I mean people complain about this all the time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "17"}
