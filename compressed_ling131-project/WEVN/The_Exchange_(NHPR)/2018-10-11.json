McKinley\nIt now known as Denali but an Alaska twenty thousand plus foot mountain and as I was talking to this was only a few weeks after arriving he said well [noise] I Do my training I trained for mount McKinley in the top of mount Washington\nAnd I I'm from buffalo in New Jersey and I thought how absurd how why would you train\nFor twenty thousand foot mountain in the top of his six thousand foot my that didn't make any sense to me so that sort of began my interest in figuring out um why this short stubby little mountain in the top of a mountain range near the top of the country\nUm is so significant [noise]\nAnd the significance as it turns out has to do\nWith the people um whose own aspirations are reflected back at them if you're an artist if you're a car driver if you're a motorcycle effects you know if you like railroads if you like whether\nOr if you're a painter there's something there for you and uh so that's what I I tried to accomplish in\nWell in a couple set of facts and figures since you mentioned the side that mount Washington I mean you're right it's it's good for you know this part of the country but it's not that bad no\nNo not at all six thousand two hundred eighty eight feet um some will tell you in two inches\nA it sits at the top of the presidential arrange um you know I'm sure all your listeners are more aware of a lot of these numbers but compared to a lot of the other mountains around the world that enjoy the same sort of legend and mythology Everest foods use the Kilimanjaro\nUm mount Washington is is a is just short and study\nSo how did not Washington gets so you know super wicked amazing right raw kind of you know that'd be rock\nPile yeah it's a well it's there's two things um\nUh they're very specific to mount Washington into that area to the to the president's ... one of course as it is it's extreme weather um it sits at the at the it's sort of forms of wall between three whether fronts in Atlanta\nAnd they're constantly letting heads up there that's how the the servers in kindergarten speak explained it to me um is that there's always these two or three weather friends that are always coming together right at that rate\nOK to ... well yeah because again it's not that high so why is the weather yeah that's a fact fly that\nOne reason so that's what draws a lot of people is of course it's it's how extreme it as um you know for being an alpine zone at five thousand feet that's that's unusual it's been because of the cold weather in the extreme weather and the wind and so forth [noise]\nUm and the other thing is it's accessibility Redmond, Washington is four hundred and fifty years now over ... six years now mount Washington has been a mountain\nThat regardless of your age or ability or disability um um regardless of you of of how much coins you have in your pocket you can go to the top of that mountain\nAnd experience that view along with anybody else along with every other hiker along with everybody motorcyclists along with everybody who's driving to the cog so it's it's a magnet which means that tourism magnet of course\nBut um it\nIt pulls 'em it pulls skill and talent right if you're a painter you can go to the top\nYou know if you love motorcycles you can go to the top you know if you love railroads you can go to the top so regardless of what your you don't have to just be a climber were hiker to share that view to touch that some it's\nI'm much I think to the frustration sometimes at the door to me to do but uh uh anyone can get up there so those two things the extreme weather and it's it's um\nA over a century of accessibility make mount Washington incredible draw\nWell and it's in this area of the country where there are a lot of major metro area people in general talk about the White Mountains in half white is a heavily used in partly it's because I'm the lights and mount Washington or within a relatively easy drive a lot of people\nYeah and the numbers are going up I'm In a two hundred and fifty thousand people a oh your\nTouch the summit signed at the top of mount Washington really allow a twenty something weddings at the observatory deck and many many more engagements at the observatory deck every year I'm\nA ... and and those those you know they both the auto road and the cog 'em and you know the AMC\nRegister higher and higher numbers every year as people more and more people go up in fact there was a [laughter] and which of course we didn't we can talk about later but which leads to more and more rescues and more and more work for the search and rescue teams there was there was one just yesterday in fact\nWell and you and I talked about that on the show a couple of months ago the search and rescue so forth and that area and as you're talking about ... for mount Washington you know so many visitors um the weather the wind speeds\nAdd danger to that list is ... um you write for a relatively small amount compared to the Rockies or the Himalayas or whatever\nUm what makes this mountain a place where you know a lot of people have died\nA to a there's a great book out by Julie boardman called death in the White Mountains they just came out a couple of months ago\nWhich is a sort of a statistical analysis of of all injuries and fatalities\nShe she lifts two hundred and twenty over the course of the mountains lifetime which is over the course of about a century a little bit over a century that's a lot um and I think part of it is um it's accessibility is a double edged sword right it's anyone can go up but anyone can go up\nIncluding people who who aren't ... yeah\nAmazes me how um you know I mean I I I mean I where I had to take my garbage out at night I [noise] I Can't believe [laughter] surprising to me that people climb this mountain or any mountain and the lights\nAfter school administrators association co sponsors of the Christa McAuliffe technology conference in Manchester November twenty seven twenty ninth NHCD MTC dot org [noise] a lot of rain on the way today possibly one to two inches high about fifty seven friday looks better partly sunny temperatures in the mid ...\nThis is an HP are this is the exchange I'm more annoying today we're talking with author Dan says me about his new book the White Mountain it's about his year with mount Washington\nAnd the story of the people who love it send us an email with your stories experiences questions about mount Washington\nOne eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven is the number email exchange at an H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at ... each PR exchange again our email address is exchange\nAt and H. P. R. dot org also be sure to check out our Web site today for more stories articles by Dan some pictures and some more history again it's an H. P. R. dot org slash exchange that's our website and check it out today so Dan I'm couple big pieces of this book\nHave to do with your time at the weather observatory and as you told us before the break you lived up there in April so you know still wintertime you you talked about what it feels like to be outside um and the wind and so forth\nTalk about rhyme ice ... that's a big theme up there on my way out is Ryan ...\nWho all its um when a there's a lot then and now I'm not a meteorologist so\nOr listening to please call in and correct me\nWhen the the temperature when is enough humidity in there\nBut there's heavy winds are strong wins um it actually will create sort of sideways sideways snow sideways ice forms disease\nI'm back in the in the Eighteen Seventy is the one of the first groups that were up there to experience ... called it\nFeathered sculptures right there are these ... sculptures\nUm the form off the side of buildings and offer their equipment and\nAnd it's all very delicate and light I'm In it or as soon as you break it away\nIf the wind is blowing it it forms again in some cases the ice the rhyme ice can form you know six seven eight ten inches and it's just it's it's it's unlike anything you know that that you've ever if you're ever going to see\nWhen I went out into the wind the humidity was high enough that when we finally went back into the tower after about\n... maybe twelve or Thirteen minutes when we finally went back into the weather room rhyme I said started to form a parka my black park I had started the formed his little his little feathers these little sliver of of ice on my shoulders and on my hands it was a really cool\nHow did they even um had even happened that an observatory was built up there\nYeah the well back in the um Eighteen seventies through the Eighteen nineties that's a long time ago yeah the original ... that they weren't called it back then but the ... eventually became the U.S signal corps I'm actually putting observatory into the tip top house which is one of the the original sort of ... hotels up there\nAnd they um they did some and then I go to a little bit of detail about how that all happened um which is a very complicated process because for a long said nobody thought you could survive up there I'm In the wintertime\nAnd then uh that sort of petered out I think Eighteen Ninety two early Eighteen nineties and nothing happened uh as far as an observatory again until Nineteen thirty two and there was four founders of the observatory um everybody's heard of one of them Joe dodge which is you know there's been books\nFor a whole bunch of really good at it now um I mean he's in\nHis his his fame proceeds him you know there's really no way to know whether he did wrestle that buried with his bare hands are not um but the other three guys uh Alex McKenzie us alpaca Pagliuca and Bob moynahan\nHow the for them along with that at ... the cat their first mascot who was up there so there I guess there's five founders um formed observatory Nineteen thirty two and\nI'm a uh\nIn Nineteen thirty four was one day recorded the the world's actually how I've written it down because you have to actually say it properly the world's fastest surfaced wind speed ever observed by man I'm at two hundred and thirty one miles an hour\nHere you have to be careful because there's some other places than people who want to declare that\nYou have to say it that way because uh in the late nineties uh cycling off the coast of Australia I'm an unmanned booby registered higher wind speeds so I bet that scene that's cheating that's not fair\n[laughter] well and I read in your book that not move so lucky and I love mountain I'm In the upper valley which is that right here we're gonna talk about actually tomorrow and exchange OK okay get them out Washington at every tore off the ground yeah at first people were like I don't know if people can really up there all year round so I was lucky helped out like\nThat there was a lawyer in Manchester I'm a little um William little who was an amateur meteorologist eleven weather\nAnd he happened to own the land at the top some land inventing New Hampshire that included the top of mount was lucky and hit a little summit house up at the top of my list lucky so in some of these first um meteorologists are scientists were looking to go up there including I'm Joshua Huntington Huntington ravine is named after\nSet up an observatory in those early days up at the top of mount Washington and everyone was like well we liked the idea but you know I don't\nI don't want to be a sponsor of a an expedition where everyone dies over winters [laughter] so um the lawyer little said well why don't you go up to ... like do that first set of set it up there\nAre still you know five thousand seven hundred feet or whatever it is and if you survive that then then everyone will see that it can be done and sure enough they survived that and then everyone saw that it could be done\nIs go to our listeners again Dan our number one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven send us an email exchange at an H. P. R. dot org we're taking your questions and comments\nAbout not Washington but the mountain itself the many people who have loved this mountain who'd been inspired by it joined us one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven and a non is calling in dance so we'll go to him on the line Hi Ron welcome\nThank you very much for your great program when I first went up to Washington and tomorrow tomorrow I'm Seventy seven now and I'm like in Germany\n[noise] and I'm going to be playing back five an\nHour [laughter]\nSomething for the bucket list I'm sure you've got lots of things like that but I just wanted you know this is great and I love them out and I'm looking for\nA lot that's been tested grown up what what ... what route are you taking\nYour are are you actually going to play bagpipes up ...\nNo no no no I'm On the\nDarn it but you're going to hike it round you know and why the auto Roeder ...\nThere's a debate going on even at this moment [laughter]\nOh I think we lost Ron oh I'm so sorry Ron we lost you there um maybe he was you know hiking while while he was doing something I wanted to ask him and I'm really sorry that we lost him because um you talk in the book about killed ten hiker yeah maybe Ron's I'd kill to hike\nOr there's an there's amazing collection of a new ... when I was we'll talk about hikers in an ultimate legal Iran would probably fit really well with salt and we'd all day on this amazing collection of hikers out there uh the observatory does a yearly an annual I'm a fundraising event called seek the peak\nWhere hikers from all over the world come together and either they hike so low they register or any of the ... groups\nUm to raise money and awareness for the observatory and it's an amazing it's a crazy amazing day hundreds and hundreds of hikers up there the ... working daughter road is going so I'm Anders groups like the killed the tigers to John Donvan in fact I had mentioned earlier as a member of that group\nAnd there's ten or twelve of them and they all were killed and they hooked up the mountain or during ultimate legal day I I if if we miss from the auto road is listening or you can call tell us whether or not or there's been a I'm a bagpipe or record set hiking up the mountain because maybe round it would be interested in doing that\nSo we seek the peak is a fundraiser for the observatory and tons of people go yes um dress up and we're cause I'm dressed\nUp and weird costumes um some like there was um what are the people that I interviewed her name as a a ... who's a Seventy something sort of legendary hiker she dressed up in all Hawaiian\nHawaiian clouds whining lays and why an outfit says she hiked up um some of the groups have specific themes um that I feel like I feel for the tigers um you know others just come up with their families and a lot of people do solo hiking but it's always fun to hike in the group and you know you you create a fundraising\nContribute your fundraising Bijan all goes to the observatory it's one of them it's their major fundraiser\nSo and then on a similar theme of people doing slightly odd way than listening in on this falls in legal case so you participate in this year year with mount Washington um who is often we go oh boy\nHow much time do you um [noise] ... every year the Washington auto rode a holds alternate legal day and I also legal day I'm\nToys and coffee counter of author book signing at events\nGibson's bookstore dot com\nTough to help freedom plan at northeast delta dental partnership created for better or all at overall health right here in New Hampshire learned more it teeth to toast dot com [noise]\nIt's nine forty is the exchange continues I at age PR [noise]\nThis is the exchange I'm or canoeing this hour it's a new look at Mount Washington through a new book by Granite State writer Dan says and he called the White Mountain send us an email exchange and H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter and each PR exchange or give us a call right now one eight hundred\nEight nine to six or seven seven\nAnd Dan now here's an email from Tom in rye would your guest care to comment on the maze of property rights and land ownership of the top of mount Washington Tom says there's often a misconception it all the land is owned by the state of New Hampshire\nWhen in fact there are several private nonprofit owners that dot the area at the top a fascinating history of the land can be told Tom thank you so much and I'm Wondering about that too right like this is the top of that Washington is a state park yeah that's the hot licks the clouds is ...\nAre federal ... August private as ... I'm guessing is non ... yeah now he ran right that\nYeah it's a a a book in of itself could be written about the sort of land history of the top of mount Washington because it's changed a lot there was a time when Dartmouth College owned the top the mom watches a time when that was called the ... way we really don't realize\nI'm so yeah it it's gone back and forth I talked to 'em there's a historian out of um a Conway a guy by the name of Tom ... who ... who knows a lot about this history I don't get into it that much in the book but it's amazing that I'm\nSo there's the Appalachian Trail conservatory there's the Appalachian mountain club there's the um national forest there's the state park there's fishing game there's the cog does the observatory there's the auto road and all of these entities I'm sort of have to\nAbide by each other and I live ... at the top yeah and you know and and occasionally there's disputes\nUm and uh um but generally speaking considering and you know some as nonprofit it's state it's federal it's private um so that they get along pretty well all things considered so\nYeah Tom thank you for that I um maybe that'll be the the White Mountain park too will be a a land history of the top of the mountain because it is very interesting\nTom thanks for the email Jerry in Dover sent us an email as well he says sometime in the early seventies while on active duty\nI flew ... looking for a lost hiker he was eventually found dead but I did not know anything about him into reading a Yankee magazine article about my Washington fatalities and my dentist office I'm ... years later so Jerry\nThank you for that because you know again we keep talking about not Washington it's so popular and that's great I mean wow things happened thanks Jerry for the email and let's go back to our callers Sebastian calls in from Greenfield Sebastian go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm I've been thinking and writing and researching about I'm\nA great ... chief pass the\n... ... who read all the\nWay from um the status quo than Connecticut River and he claimed mount ... to ...\nI Believe it's the indigenous name for Washington I may have it a bit wrong\nBut there's a wonderful having a he missed about how in the end of his life he's carried off to the top of mount Washington to live\nWith the spirits up there and there was also mention and I would like you know if you're offers ever come across that or something called some doubles and people believed on top of the mountain they could find these round balls like small bowling balls split it open\nAnd it has it's sort of lightning like effect inside the lightning was trapped trapped inside the some of the bowls\nWow Sebastian on top of the mountains and play some doubles\n[laughter] thank you so much for calling because we should talk about um how Native American half view this mountain approach this mountain you right in the book for example Dan that Europeans like to say well those Native Americans they were afraid to go to the top of the mountains we really know\nDon't really true and that is true or not um in Sebastian thank you for that I actually wrote down or a ... with a question marks because\nNext book [laughter] ...\nThat's fascinating I'm definitely gonna look that up so yeah the the natives um Darby Field um was the first European um that we know of to some of the mountain way back in\nSixteen forty to sixty in forty two and uh he actually did it to the merchant out of um the ports in Missouri out of Dover I Believe are you also owned a uh a ferry across the great bay and he went twice in one summer\nBack then\nIt's unclear why he went\nTo a lot of you most ... most historians will tell you well you you know there was an expedition originally you know the ... the top of the mountain where the snow um you know was thought to perhaps silver jewels or whatever\nBut he couldn't have done it without Native American gods yet you know Native American gods who who went up there with him\nAnd he writes a little bit about how uh you know they stayed down below that didn't go way up to the top with him because it's the best and said they were afraid of a angering you know the the great spirit I'm not a I asked to learn earlier to please please don't make me hope pronounce this but I'm gonna try anyway\nUm I Believe it's pronounced as you could do that you could choose which is the origin ... or ... was called up there and then that's known as the place of the great spirit or the place of the concealed one so\nI'm the story the legend is that they are referred to go up there because that's the place of the great spirit but they could have just been afraid to go there because the nasty weather and they didn't you didn't want to\nMaybe they did go up there and they didn't go why does it really bothered you ask her to write it down so yeah\nWell Sebastian ... thank you so much and let's go to Susie in Berlin Hi Suzy go ahead you're on the air welcome\nThere I was telling your screener that um during the summer of a sixty eight I worked at the summit when they still had the old hotel uh it was a great experience we'd have one day off\nWhere we could go down to the base or go to ... have a pizza\nDo the laundry [laughter] there are times\nWhen we come back up at night and ... it being so foggy and so I'm up there that that we need you know just one of us walking in front of and to get back to the Senate\nWe use to party at the top house which was a wreck at that time and obviously no I'm electricity or light so it just for the sweet I'm hanging out there and\nDo what we did and it was a lot of fun we were employed by the Koch railway people at the time so it was quite a lot of fun not as many people\nYou know surrounding the summit during the summer uh now it's just totally over run but you know it was just a lot of fun for young kids\nWell I didn't realize that there was still a hotel at the top leaders Nineteen sixty eight is that what you said\nYes yes I Believe it might've been close to the last year they might have had it running perhaps you know in sixty nine I Know there was a very tragic accident where um maybe one third I could be off on my own measurements but\nVery soon after you left the summit a there was a train that jumped the tracks I think this switch manner there was some confusion of\nSwitching the tracks and it slid off and luckily landed\nStill you know on the summit where you're there is a flat area where the I think air force used to do do some some kind of testing or what have you but several people were um or kill\nTo remember we were actually yeah yeah my father was the sheriff at that time of course county so he was up\nYou know obviously assisting with\nSupport for any ... life's dream comes from you our listeners and from Congress regional visiting nurse association\nA home health in hospice agency serving people of all ages more than forty one communities

book a guy by the name of a rush staples who also worked maybe she he knew Suzie I'm worked at the uh for the cog he worked at the summit house\nAnd that was the name of the law yeah sixty four sixty five and a employed a lot of young people back then you know early teenagers are sort of the crew of Washington\nAnd ... that's ... he was right there would actually be on for a week there one day off and\nIn that one day off or you know they would scramble back off the off the summit to get down to the\nW.

McKinley\nIt now known as Denali but in Alaska twenty thousand plus foot ... and as I was talking to this was only a few weeks after arriving he said well [noise] I Do my training I trained for mount McKinley in the top of mount Washington\nAnd I I'm from buffalo in New Jersey and I thought how absurd how why would you train\nFor twenty thousand foot mountain in the top of his six thousand something that didn't make any sense to me so that sort of began my interest in figuring out um why this short stubby little mountain in the top of a mountain range near the top of the country\nIs so significant\nAnd the significance as it turns out has to do\nWith the people um whose own aspirations are reflected back at them if you're an artist if you're a car driver if you're a motorcycle effects you know if you like railroads if you like whether\nOr if you're a painter there's something there for you and uh so that's what I I tried to accomplish\nWell in a couple set of facts and figures since you mentioned the side that mount Washington and mean you're right it's it's a big for you know this part of the country but it's not that bad no\nNo not at all six thousand two hundred eighty eight feet um some will tell you in two inches\nA it sits at the top of the presidential range um you know I'm sure all of your listeners are aware of a lot of these numbers but compared to a lot of the other mountains around the world that enjoy the same sort of legend and mythology Everest foods use the Kilimanjaro Z\nUm mount Washington is is a is just short and study\nSo how did not Washington get so you know super wicked amazing right raw kind of you know this is Debbie rock\nPile yeah it's well it's there's two things um\nUh they're very specific to mount Washington into that area to the to the president's ... one of course as it is it's extreme weather um it sits at the at the\nIt's sort of forms of wall between three whether fronts in Atlantic from Canada and from the Ohio Valley and they're constantly butting heads up there that's how the the servers in kindergarten speak explained it to me um is that there's always these two or three weather friends that are always coming together right at that rate\nOK to ... well yeah because again it's not that high so why is that what ... that's a that's why that\nOne reason so that's what draws a lot of people is of course it's it's how extreme it as um you know ... for being an alpine zone at five thousand feet that's that's unusual it's been because of the cold weather in the extreme weather in the wind and so forth\nUm and the other thing is it's accessibility Redmond, Washington is for a hundred and fifty years now over ... six years now not Washington has been a mountain that regardless of your age or ability or ...\nRegardless of of of how much coins you have in your pocket you can go to the top of that mountain and experience that view along with anybody else along with every other hiker along with everybody motorcyclist along with everybody who's driving the the cog so it's it's a magnet which means that tourism magnet of course\nBut um it\nIt pulls 'em it pulls skill and talent right if you're a painter you can go to the top\nYou know if you love motorcycles you can go to the top you know if you love railroads you can go to the top so regardless of what your you don't have to just be a climber or a hiker to share that view to touch that ...\nI'm much I think the frustration sometimes of the outdoor computer do but ah ah anyone can get up there so those two things the extreme weather and it's it's um\nA over a century of accessibility make my Washington credible draw\nWell and it's in this area of the country where they are a lot of major metro area people in general to talk about the White Mountains and half white is a heavily used and partly because I'm the lights and mount Washington or within a relatively easy drive a lot of people\nYeah and the numbers are going up I'm In a two hundred and fifty thousand people a oh your\nTouch the summertime at the top of mount Washington really allow a twenty something weddings at the observatory deck in many many more engagements at the observatory deck every year um [noise]\nUh the and and those those you know they both the auto road and the cog 'em and you know the AMC\nAre registered higher and higher numbers every year as people more and more people go up in fact there was a ... and which of course when we could talk about later but which leads to more and more rescues and more and more work for the search and rescue teams there was there was one just yesterday in fact\nWell and you and I talked about that on the show a couple of months ago in a search and rescue so forth in that area and as you're talking about the ... caves form out Washington you know so many visitors um the weather the wind speeds add danger to that lifted ... Dan I'm you write for a relatively small amount compared to the\nRockies or Himalayas or whatever\nUm what makes this mountain a place where you know lots of people have died\nOr to a there's a great book out by Julie boardman called death in the White Mountains who just came out a couple of months ago\nWhich is a sort of a statistical analysis of of all injuries and fatalities\nShe she lifts two hundred and twenty over the course of the mountains lifetime which is over the course of about a century it was a little bit over a century that's a lot um and I think part of it is um it's accessibility is a double edged sword right it's anyone can go up but anyone can go up\nIncluding people even people who who aren't ... yeah and it amazes me how um you know I mean I I I mean I where I had to take my garbage out at night I [noise] I Can't believe [laughter] surprising to me that people climb this mountain or any mountain the whites without\nWoodstock in brewery announcing autumn ale made with apple and cinnamon flavor\nFor the pumpkin intolerant available at the brewery ed in stores Woodstock in an age dot com bust your school administrators association co sponsors of the Christa McAuliffe technology conference in Manchester November twenty seven to ... died NHCD MTC dot or\nThis is an HP are this is the exchange I'm more annoying today we're talking with author Dan says any about his new book the light mountain it's about his year with mount Washington and the story of the people who love it send us an email with your stories experiences questions about mount Washington one\nEight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven is the number email exchange at an H.

R. dot org also be sure to check out our Web site today for more stories articles by Dan some pictures and some more history again it's an H. P. R. dot org slash exchange that's our website and check it out today so Dan I'm couple big pieces of this book\nHas to do with your time at the weather observatory and as you told us before the break you lived up there in April so you know still wintertime you you talked about what it feels like to be outside um and the wind and so forth\nTalk about rhyme ice that's a big theme up there I'm Out what what is Ryan ...\nSchool it's um when a there's a lot then and now I'm not a meteorologist so if if you know one of the observers or listening to please call in and correct me uh but my understanding is that when the when the the temperature when there's enough humidity in the air\nBut there's heavy winds are strong wins um it actually will create sort of sideways sideways snow sideways ice forms disease\nI'm back in the in the Eighteen Seventy is the one of the first groups that were up there to experience for him was called the\nFeathered sculptures right there are these ... sculptures\nUm the form off the side of buildings and offer their equipment and it's all very delicate and light I'm In it as soon as you break it away if the wind is blowing it informs again in some cases the ice the rhyme mice conform you know six seven eight ten inches\nUnlike anything or you know that that you've ever if you're ever going to see when I went out into the wind the humidity was high enough that when we finally went back into the tower after about\nWho maybe twelve or Thirteen minutes when we finally went back into the weather room rhyme I said started to form a parka my black park I had started the formed his little his little feathers these little sliver of of ice on my shoulders and on my hands it was really cool\nHow did they even um had even happened that an observatory was built up there\nYeah the well back in the um Eighteen seventies through the Eighteen nineties that's a long time ago yeah the original it that they weren't called it back then but the ... eventually became the U.S signal corps I'm actually putting observatory into the tip top house which is one of the the original sort of ... hotels up there\nAnd they um they did some and then I go to a little bit of detail about how that all happened um which is a very complicated process because for a long said nobody thought you could survive up there I'm In the wintertime\nAnd then uh that sort of petered out I think Eighteen Ninety two early Eighteen nineties and nothing happened uh as far as an observatory again until Nineteen thirty two and there was four founders of the observatory um everybody's heard of one of them Joe dodge which is you know there's been books for\nA whole bunch of them that that's a really good at it now um\nI mean he's in his his his fame proceeds him you know there's really no way to know whether he did wrestle that buried with his bare hands are not um but the other three guys uh Alex McKenzie us alpaca ... and Bob moynahan\nHow the for them along with a a picky the cat their first mascot who was up there so there I guess there was five founders um formed observatory Nineteen thirty two and\nI'm a uh\nIn Nineteen thirty four was one day recorded the the world's actually how I've written it down because you have to actually say it properly the world's fastest surfaced wind speed ever observed by man I'm at two hundred and thirty one miles an hour\nHe has to be careful because there's some other places in people who want to declare that\nYou have to say it that way because uh in the late nineties uh cycling off the coast of Australia I'm an unmanned booby registered higher wind speeds so I bet that scene that's cheating that's not fair\n[laughter] well and I read in your book that not move so lucky and I love mountain I'm In the upper valley which is that right here I'm going to talk about actually tomorrow in exchange OK okay get them out Washington at every tore off the ground yeah at first people were like oh I don't know if people can really up there all year round so I was lucky helped out like\nThat there is a lawyer in Manchester I'm a little um William little who was an amateur meteorologist eleven weather\nAnd he happened to own the land at the top some land inventing New Hampshire that included the top of mount was lucky and hit a little summit house up at the top of my list lucky so in some of these first um meteorologists are scientists were looking to go up there including I'm Joshua Huntington hunting ravine is named after\nWe're looking for a way to set up an observatory in those early days up at the top of mount Washington and everyone was like well we liked the idea but you know I don't\nI don't want to be a sponsor of a an expedition where everyone dies over winter [laughter] so um the lawyer little said well why don't you go up to like do that first set set it up there\nAre still you know five thousand seven hundred feet or whatever it is and if you survive that then then everyone will see that it can be done and sure enough they survived that and everyone saw that it could be done\nIs go to our listeners again I Dan our number one eight hundred eight

I'm guessing is non ... you know run right but\nYet it's a of a book in another itself could be written about the sort of land history of the top of mount Washington because it's changed a lot there was a time when I start with college owned the top the mom watches the time with our with called ... railway we really don't realize\nI'm so yeah it it's going back and forth or talk to them there's a historian out of um a Conway got by the name of Tom control who taught who ... who knows a lot about this history I don't get into it that much in the book but it's amazing that I'm\nSo there's the Appalachian Trail conservatory there's the Appalachian mountain club there's the uh\nThere's fishing game there's the cog there's the observatory there's the auto road and all of these entities I'm sort of have to\nAbide by each other and I live ... at the top yeah and you know and and occasionally there's disputes\nUm and uh um but generally speaking considering and you know some as nonprofit it's state it's federal it's private um so that they get along pretty well all things considered so\nYeah Tom thank you for that I um maybe that'll be the the White Mountain park too will be a a land history of the top of the mountain because it is very interesting Tom\nThanks for the email Jerry in Dover sent us an email as well he says sometime in the early seventies while on active duty I flew ... looking for a lost hiker he was eventually found dead but I did not know anything about him into reading a Yankee magazine article about my Washington ... ... and my dentist office I'm ... years later so Jerry\nThank you for that because you know again we keep talking about not Washington it's so popular and that's great I mean wow things happened thanks scary for the email and let's go back to our callers Sebastian calls in from Greenfield Sebastian go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm I've been thinking and writing and researching about um [noise]\nThe great ... chief pass the ...\n... ... away\nFrom 'em ... Connecticut River and he claimed mount ... months to call\nI Believe in the indigenous name from um Washington I may have been a bit wrong\nBut there's a wonderful having a he missed about how in the end of his life he's carried off to the top of mount Washington to live with the spirits up there and there was also mentioned and I would like to know if you're offers ever come across that\nOr something called some doubles and people believed on the top of the mountain they could find these round balls like small bowling balls split it open and it has for the lightning like effect inside as the lightning was trapped trapped inside some doubles\nWow Sebastian\nOn top of the mountain play some doubles\n[laughter] thank you so much for calling because we should talk about um how Native American half view this mountain approach this mountain you right in the book for example Dan that Europeans like to say well those Native Americans they were afraid to go to the top of the novel we really never\n... drew and that is true or not um in Sebastian thank you for that I actually wrote down or a thunder balls with a question marks because\nNext book [laughter]\n... that's fascinating I'm definitely gonna look that up so yeah the the natives um Darby Field um was the first European um that we know of to some of the mountain way back in\nSixteen forty two sixteen forty two and uh he actually did it to the merchant out of um the Portsmouth area to Dover I Believe or he also owned a I'm\nA ferry across the great bay and he went twice in one summer um in fact there's a considerable effort and a trip back then\nIt's unclear why he went\nUm a lot of you know most sort of like mountain historians will tell you well he you know there was the expectation of riches you know the Mica at the top of the mountain or the snow um you know was thought to perhaps silver or jewels or whatever\nBut he couldn't have done it without Native American guides he actually had Native American guy to who went up there with him um [noise]\nAny rights a little bit about how uh you know they stayed down below they didn't go all the way up to the top with him because as Sebastian said they were afraid of a angering um you know the the great spirit um now I asked a lot earlier to please please don't make me help me pronounce this but I'm gonna try anyway\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked ... in your community was convenient locations throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think is a Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nDorms Hitchcock's here they didn't want to\nMaybe they did go up there and they didn't go by what I'm really bothered you ask her to write it down so yes\nWell Sebastian ... thank you so much and let's go to Susie in Berlin Hi Suzy go ahead you're on the air welcome\nThere I was telling your screener that um during the summer of ah sixty eight I worked up at the summit when they still had the old hotel uh it was a great experience we'd have one day off\nWhere we could go down to the base or go to ... have a piece or do\nThe laundry [laughter] there are times\nWhen we come back up at night and it being so foggy and so I'm souped up there that we need you know just one of us walking in front of the ... and to get back to the Senate\nWe use to party at the tip top house which was a wreck at that time and obviously no I'm electricity or light so\nJust for the coup freed 'em hang out there and\nDo what we did and it was a lot of fun we were employed by the Koch railway people at the time so it was um quite a lot of fun not as many people\nYou know surrounding the summit during the summer ah now it's just totally overrun by it you know it was just a lot of fun for a young kid\nWell let me I didn't realize that there was still a hotel at the top in as late as Nineteen sixty eight that what you said\nYes yes I Believe it might've been close to the last year they might have had it running perhaps you know in sixty nine I Know there was a very um tragic accident where um maybe one third I could be off on my um measurements but\nVery soon after you left the Senate or there was a train that jump that tracks I think this is a switch men are there was some confusion over from switching the tracks and it slid off and luckily landed\nStill you know on the summit where you're there is a flat area where the I think air force used to do do some some kind of testing or what have you but several people were um or kill\nTo remember we were actually yeah yeah my father was the sheriff at that time of course county so he was a fear you know obviously assisting with all that but um\nWow was it'd be a lot of stories thank you so much for calling and first of all I mean working at a hotel the hobby a young person I'm Nineteen sixty eight but it does little bit more about that I didn't realize that there was out there that\nWas really common story of of if you're a teenager early in the sixties I heard this from a lot of folks who are now would probably be in the sixties now I Would guess\nI'm In fact I interview one in the book the name of a rush staple who also worked maybe she he knew he worked at the for the call you worked at the summit house or not that was the name of the hotel yeah sixty four sixty five and a employed a lot of young people back then you know really the news or sort of the crew\n... that's ... he was right there would actually be on for weeks or even a one day off and in that one day off or you know they would scramble back off the off the summit to get down to the", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "11"}
