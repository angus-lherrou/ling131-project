Canada and they cross country ski that all the way across the one of the I don't even know what it is they said cool things that I Do not do\nAnd not to compare isn't it it yeah it is and what we need to remember is that\nOne of us does something that's that's cool you you are doing you like there's something that you guys are doing as a family and whether it's that you love to bake and you bake regularly or you make a huge thing out of Halloween [noise] um I I heard a great one the other day a parent of kids who were actually adults now\nYou know what it her kids look back on and sort of see is the big thing in their family and they were like oh we had these great conversations around the dinner table no simple as that you can't put that on the interest\nYou know you're you're not ... but her kids and their friends remember that they had these in depth and detail dinner table conversation so that is her doing her and I'm sure that she felt like\nYou know well but if we were really cool I'd be playing the guitar and you know we'd all be on the [laughter] actually happen to me and we were at a party recently and um it was Carol done she's the\nHead of the northern stage in I'm In the upper valley in New Hampshire and she got other guitar and her daughter got a guitar and they played a song and we all ... there's never happens to me before in my whole life and it was so wonderful I turned him I said I said\nI Wish we could do that with the guitar and he said me too and I said except I just wish we could do it I actually wish me had to learn how to do it and he was like yeah [laughter] you can't do everything you you're not supposed to do everything but you are doing something that is used that as like the thing\nFor you I really appreciate that because a couple of weeks ago you know beautiful weather you know end of summer early fall day and I ran into a friend and her daughter and\nThey're like oh we just knocked off three more for thousands of\nSomething we're doing together and I was like oh I'm not I am not doing that\nBut I think maybe I'm doing other stuff I don't know you learn their thirties [laughter] it's really hard to see our own things um but everybody has got them and that's why I Love that conversation example because that's who would who would see that like you're not going to be like\nAnd to know we had another of our great conversations here's the into back I made I mean you know yeah right and you can't put great family conversations on Instagram I Wonder what you think about social media kind of increasing this\nCompetitiveness for look at my awesome fan you know it's funny because I hear that a lot but it isn't my um it's not really my experience on social media of the\nI ... and you know obviously I'm pretty\nFollow it and and follow a lot of people I I it's it's I see a lot of honesty I think um some of the problem is that we don't even look at the honesty we only look\nAt the pretty pictures so I frequently see people sort of you know posting that their kids had a screaming fight on Instagram and stuff like that I don't think it's as bad\nUm I think again it's a question of what our mind is focusing on and we do tend to focus on wait if they're climbing the four thousand peaks in four thousand foot or I don't want to be like Oh absolutely that's how I felt that just natural helpful thanks brains there yeah right another way we're making our battles are up\nUm I don't know if you do use so part is what you just said kj you know um [noise]\nYou know don't compare to self so much other families look at what your family is doing that makes you kind of cool that the other thing that I took out of that is um parents who feel like they're selfish if they do their own thing um you know I\nGet together with a friend I Would love to read a book but I have to drive Johnny and Suzie too you know six places I'm so that to me feels like you do you as well as any none of them you know you can set aside you can set aside some time for yourself\nYeah that is another great meaning of that and one of the things I didn't I didn't put it on my list of ... but another thing that I frequently say is don't put your kids first all the time you know if they're not leading your needs your the grown up\nUh Linda from east end over says truth in reporting interesting programming and I've got three people who say just unbiased unbiased think that's a word that that captures a lot of what we do here in New Hampshire Public radio and it's probably a reason that you listen to you like New Hampshire public radio even if you don't think about it that way all the time\nWell today we're asking you to think about it that way to be intentional about you're listening and to make a choice to decide if you like step programming it is unbiased and that's the reason you like it didn't support it with a gift right now at an H.

only was I writing myself so odd interviewing talking to experts really I'm Out there I was also I'm editing so I Would get essays not just the ones that you actually saw fewer reader of of the mother lode but easily for every episode or every um essay that we published you know fifty\nPlus probably that we didn't and that the tone was\nSort of really it was this this sense of being really fraught and there was this overwhelming um\nIdea that this is really hard and you know it takes wine and you should be kept to get through it and we're we're all really we're in the trenches and all that you know the metaphors we used an everything they were all kind of like\nLike negative like this is work this is really an and it is hard it's not like you know having kids is not like not having kids but I don't think any of us went into it with this idea of I Know I'd like to spend the next Fifteen Years driving people places and making doctors appointments\nSo a lot of the stories\nYou heard from people were just like give like digging ditches yeah I'd just daily grind sort of a joyous\nSlug and you didn't the shows that too like we answer research surveys in way and you know we tell people would rather do laundry than spend time with our kids um you know we we end up with these headlines that are like how having children robs parents of all joy and that's a real headline\n[laughter] it's it's um you know we're we're seeing it as real as a chore [noise] so\nYou have your own story in here yeah too about how you know twelve years into raising these four kids and you say you know despite the blessings of for healthy children and a reasonable income you found yourself complaining a lot grumpy a lot\nYou and your husband you know would get into bed at night and sort of you know trade stories about who had the worst day with the\nPeople and it really kind of you than you know so why bother having a family I mean so what was going on in your own life I just\nUm well you know I had a fulltime job my husband had a fulltime job leave these four kids and we of course we've signed him up for everything and it will tell you a classically a New Hampshire thing about my oldest child who is now Seventeen that when he was\nA you know in a ... second grade he played hockey\nAnd he did downhill ski racing and he'd do Nordic swell racing and then my second child played hockey\nAnd she tried the race you know and then the third and fourth child um you know they ... they they love to snowboard which is what they ended up doing 'cause we live here and you got to do stuff\nThey can Nordic ski but gosh knows we we weren't in any organized pro I mean you know we we we did all the things with the first one and then we tried to do all the things with the second one and then you're sort of hauling the third and fourth went around and it's just\nUm it's just it got to be too much what did it feel like describe the sort of daily slog that you found yourself well we ... we call it into work by the way in addition to to work which was you know it it it was it the full time\nJob as a lovely flexible job and and my husband has a pretty flexible jobs and we had good right\nBut every day we were just sort of get up and lace up our skates and start running and we didn't seem like we didn't feel like we stopped until nine or ten o'clock at night at which point we

how to be happy either had to be happy or so um you know I I sort of I\nI heard myself touted as a parenting expert which makes me wants to crawl under tables certainly my children will laugh because why would I Am as a journalist who had a problem and a way to get at that problem in a way to research at end to talk to a lot\nOf people and come up with ideas so what I mean what the book in some ways just boils down to it what if if if\nUnhappy and some area of your parents ... and ... I have definitely found that most of us are\nWhat which area is it and what is making un happier which areas are there and what is making them on you and happy and then it's the sort of question of well is there something that you can do differently or is there a way to think about it differently and one of the other of those is\nBecause a lot of what we we don't get everything right when we don't always let our brains do this you know our our brains can can really mess with our happiness sometimes so it's not\nYeah I I Can't really get up and say here is the answer to your morning crisis here and stuff you can do to make this better and it's it's made things better for me\nWell and we're going to get into that mindset because really beyond the sort of you know you can do this for mornings you can do this about chores that's not really what it's about it's about a different mindset I'm I wanted by the listeners to join us as well cage you the number for you to be part of our conversation we'd love to hear from you\nOne eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven one eight hundred eight nine to\n... and H PR send us an email exchange\nAt and H.

P. R. dot org or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven so kj you write that happier parenting is largely about your mindset also the mechanics and the rules and so forth you establish a new home but really\nYou say the mindset is where it all begins\nSo what's the what's this um magic mindset that will\nTurns dressed up parents had ... it's totally magic so everybody really close I mean now okay quick somebody finds daddy [laughter] it it's I'm\nA big part of this battle of being happier and your family and a happier at home is wanting to be happier and deciding to make the changes or to think about things differently that will make you happier and it's funny\nFunny thing because it sounds really obvious like well of course everyone wants to be happier and the pursuit of happiness and this was in fact maybe we're too concerned about happened out there we go we're sliding off down the slippery slope of well maybe happiness is bad um\nI talked to one researcher I'm Rick Hanson he's written a book called hard wiring happiness and it's all about how our brains are\nGeared to look for bad stuff and and so it's about the different mindset but what really struck me about our conversation and what hit one of the things that has stuck with me and\nHe said sometimes when I talked to Americans I feel like they're afraid to be happy really like we don't think it's okay we don't think we have er and I think this is goes deadly so for parents we think we have\nBut I'm a little harder to get a kid who has a big disappointment or you know who fail the test that they could have staying and maybe you said there's little study a little more instead of playing Fortnite um you know it's it's hard\nBut I feel like once you've practice did some and realized how great it feels to keep your own um your own little a little distance to be a little separate then it gets it gets easier it's something that gets easier with practice\nThe other one that um there's a lot of these that are very helpful to sort of flip that mindset switch cage a um another one you have is\nPeople and especially children change and that's hard to remember when your kid has done something unkind or even truly awful you know you can easily spin out of scenarios you know because he did this he's going to do this and he's going to do this and he'll never get a job and he'll end up in\nJail and you know it's easy to go there yeah no it's it's easier to go there than it is not to go there our brains are designed to see all the worst possible for you know possible outcomes of\nAny given thing because that's in theory how we're supposed to be able to avoid them which works great if you're trying to go around the tiger that's behind Bush but not so great you know if if you're just having a panic because your child is not going to make the fifth grade advanced math class which means they won't be an algebra the right time and they won't get to take calculus in high school and they want you know so\nUm it's it's harder when when the thing is not not a real tiger I'm [noise]\nI'm Sorry I lost track could well and I just idea\nOf it and it's super interesting it's it's sort of brain science is that we didn't really ... to to awful live to go to the worst possible scenario\nBut now in our society you know there's all these like scary warnings kind of like what you said if you don't get into the math class you won't get it out and then murdered a you know and then harbors out of the question and you know we could talk for an hour about who cares I mean a lot of other options\nBut let's begin a you know we we are and if we don't care specifically about that thing we care you know it's just this weird dichotomy of wanting your kid to\nBe happy all the time and yet knowing that being happy all the time is not the right thing for them so you you've got that piece of it and then you've got this deal training your brain to not react in a huge way when\nThings seem scary because they're probably most of the things we do as threats for our kids aren't\nInstinctively every parent listening would agree they say well of course I Know my kids are not supposed to be happy all the time but at the moment and ... it will just this one just this one All right we will talk a lot more after a short break I'm going to ask you about you do you that's another um\nMonterey and they get into some of the biggies that I Know parents ask you about all the time screens chores homework and\nSibling fights will talk about all that coming up so stay with us

R.\nDot org or give us a call we'd love to hear from you one eight hundred\nEight nine to fix for seven seven one eight hundred eight nine to ... and H PR so Katy before we go to our listeners um one more mindset Montreal if I could call it that I'm about parental happiness is\nYou do you what are you trying to say there um you know\nPeople do such cool things which when as parents\nSay you know they take their kids and they live abroad for a year or they climb every you know all the major peaks and New Hampshire or you know they go to ... Canada and they cross country ski that all the way across the one of the I don't even know what it is such cool things that I Do not do\nNot to compare isn't it yeah it is and what we need to remember is that\nEvery one of us does something that sets you you are doing you like there's something that you guys are doing as a family and whether it's that you love to bake and you bake regularly or you make a huge thing out of Halloween um I I heard a great when the other day a parent of kids who were actually adults now\nYou know what it her kids look back on and sort of see as the big thing in their family and they were like oh we had these great conversations around the dinner table now\nYou know you're you're not ... but her kids and\nTheir friends remember that they had these in depth detailed dinner table conversation so that is her doing her and I'm sure that she felt like you know well but if we were really cool I'd be playing the guitar and you know we'd all be actually happened\nTo me and we were at a party recently and um it was Carol done she's the\nHead of the northern stage in I'm In the upper valley and in New Hampshire and she got out of guitar and her daughter got a guitar and they played a song and we all ... this was never happens to me before in my whole life and it was so wonderful I turned to my son I said\nI Wish we could do that with the guitar and he sent me too and I said except I just wish we could do it I don't actually wish me had to learn how to do it and he was like yeah [laughter] you can do everything you you're not supposed to do everything but you are doing something that is used that as like the thing\nFor you I really appreciate that because a couple of weeks ago you know beautiful weather you know end of summer early fall day and I ran into a friend and her daughter and\nThey're like oh we just knocked off three more for thousands of this is something we're doing together and I was like oh I Am not I am not doing that but I think maybe I'm doing other stuff I don't know in our learn their thirties [laughter] it's really hard\nTo see our own things um but everybody has got them and that's why I Love that conversation example because that's who would\nWho would see that like you're not going to be like and to know we had another of our great conversations here's the into back and I made I mean you know yeah right and you can't put\nGreat family conversations on Instagram I Wonder what you think about social media kind of increasing this competitiveness for\nLook at my awesome fast you know it's funny 'cause I hear that a lot but it isn't my um it's not really my experience on social media of the people I ... and you know I obviously am pretty follow it and and follow a lot of people I I it's it's I see a lot of honesty I think\nSome of the problem is that we don't even look at the honesty we only look at the pretty pictures so frequently see people sort of you know posting that their kids had a screaming fight on Instagram and stuff like that I don't think it's as bad\nUm I think again it's a question of what our mind is focusing on and we do tend to focus on wait\nIf they're climbing the four thousand peaks four thousand foot or I don't want to make like absolutely that's how I felt that suggests natural helpful thanks brains area right another way we're making our ... up up I'm part of this you\nDo use so part is what you just said kj you know um [noise]\nYou know don't compare to sell so much to other families look at what your family is doing that makes you kind of cool\nBut the other thing that I took out of that is um parents who feel like they're selfish if they do their own thing um you know I Would love to go to the gym I Would love to get together with a friend I Would love to read a book but I have to drive Johnny and Suzie to you know six places I'm\nSo that to me feels like you do you as well as I Know them you know you can set aside you consider that some time for yourself\nYeah that is another great meaning of that and one of the things I didn't I didn't put it on my list of ... but another thing that I frequently say is don't put your kids first all the time\nThat the boyfriend who comes home and gets up after dinner and says may I help you clear the table is way better than the one that leans back and you know or or grabs his his ... the the kid that brought him there and says oh we're heading to them now you know you don't want to raise that kid\nYou don't want to raise the college roommate who thinks ferries come and do the dishes you know they don't even I have to get to this thing and we've all had that room mate so you know there there's some important stuff for kids here as well that they need this they need to be a part of it\nWill be getting to the title of your book so you know maybe there's research showing that kids who do chores are you know more self sufficient adults and so forth but definitely you don't even tell you this if your kids are contributing to the household you will be happier in the head of the book is how to be happier parent not how to be happier\nKid now ... is that you probably will just feel happier because you know it's the right thing to do because I'm research that showed that will take approximately five years for your children to learn to clear their dish off of the table without being asked\nAnd the fact that that research was done by me on a sample set of four and my kitchen should not be the last ... you know it's gonna take forever I'm getting kids to do their chores\nAnd especially if it's not something that you've sort of really started as a super young age and and had ingrained in the family is hard it's it's um it's actually maybe ...\nIn itself maybe not can get a contribute to your immediate happiness this this is a long term happiness project I was a lot of the parents that I talked to who felt who felt good about this you know who felt like they were on the right track or that their kids you know that they'd gotten there yet adult kids and it worked out what they told me was to separate that isn't to to\nTo want you want your kid\nTo put
