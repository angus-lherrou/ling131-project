R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at an HBO exchange or calling one eight hundred eight nine to fix\nFor seven seven our guests are Jeff find gold editor of and half your business review Jeff thanks for being here if I Survived the law also with us Brian ... principal of ... research and economic research firm based in Dover Frankenstein thank you for it to be here Laura and also with us ... president of applied economic research\nAnd economic and real estate consulting firm in the county and reflecting back with the banks well gentleman just sort of put us in the time machine and go back a decade\nLet's hear a little bit from a speech from then President Bush\nThis was on September twenty fourth\nTwo thousand eight so right around this time and here he is acknowledging the deep deep economic anxiety many Americans were feeling at that time\nWe've seen triple digits swings in the stock market major financial institutions have cheated on me\nAs an certainly has grown many banks have restricted the lending credit markets frozen and families and businesses are founded harder to borrow money\nWe're in the midst of a serious financial crisis and the federal government is responding with decisive action\nAgain that's President Bush September twenty four two thousand eight and in a minute God's will talk about what that decisive action what the rest of the time machine what do you remember from that time as an economist what were you looking at\nWhat was really frightening when Lehman Brothers collapsed we were on the verge of really an international pressure and and I think that the the interesting thing and looking back from today is that it really did become a bipartisan type recovery\nUh Bush started it and Obama continued it\nBut it was very when Lehman Brothers failed Burr Stearns right on the verge of failing banks just pulled back and weren't lending people were a\nA nationally you know a a having a very difficult time finding credit here in New Hampshire during the downturn we had maybe twenty twenty five thousand homes go through foreclosure we lost personal income for the first time in years thirty thousand jobs evaporated so it was really um [noise]\nUh it's called the great recession and that there wasn't a big difference between the great recession and another depression at that time that was the fear\nWell a little bit later we'll dig into some of the state focus details you mentioned um rats and I'm Glad you mentioned housing and financial institutions which definitely talked about those what are you looking at ten years ago Brian uh [noise]\nI feel like I was a fighter pilot I've never flown a jet\nFighter but um when all those alarm start going off you know and all the the light start blinking that's kind of the way\nI felt there was so many things that we are going wrong at that time uh five days before the stock market crashed I did a presentation September twenty four to a bank board of trustees day we played that clip from yeah go ahead sorry I said I was really nervous um you know you saw\nA that delinquent sees that were rising you saw banks that we're starting to get runs where depositors were so worried there are withdrawing their savings and I said you know this is really\nScary um uh you know and I wonder if this is going to happen in New Hampshire and to be president interrupted me and he said Brian I spent all morning talking to my depositors who had called wondering if they should take their money out of our bank that's how scary it was and that's a small community bank in New Hampshire\nWow what were you looking at Jeff ... actually it's interesting because I Know that we did a lot of reporting going back about two thousand seven about eight or more over a year before that about a ... a rash of a lot of people who who homeowners will be under water and they had these a\nFancy mortgages they're with that that we later found out that he gave the names subprime and people who really probably should have mortgages and they probably shouldn't have had an home August said they'd been buying homes for three hundred thousand dollars in their income was nowhere near that ability to pay for that and it was mostly throughout one ... one company called country why which was one of the casualties of this uh [noise]\nI guess they called the great recession but it was at the time we felt like it was a depression and it was that kind of a frightening a era the the other thing that that was striking was we tracked bankruptcies every month and\nGoing out around the time of leaving you know after that the ... all of a sudden you start knowing noticing an uptick in personal biography bankruptcies and business bankruptcies in New Hampshire\nAnd it was starting to rise it obviously became much worse oh nine ten eleven but it's not we started seeing that and and things have been going so well in New Hampshire and and around the country like it was almost like what's going on here is ... is like is like noticing something's wrong with you see dripping come out of your roof all of a sudden\nKilling at an age gee maybe I should have noticed that there yet we ... we were looking for their things and you know and then we talk to people who are saying well you know everything's fine you know the answer is going to be resilient you know they gave us the same old stuff they usually give us\nBut as Brian ... unless they're saying you know you know there's something would it have apprehension ... apprehensive\nGood right you know if we didn't know we were in a recession in September of of two thousand I mean things were looking bad and and the numbers were were falling off clearly but you know during that first nine months we lost a couple of thousand jobs in New Hampshire then you look at what happened after the end of September\n... eight nine ten thousand jobs were lost in the next four or five months it was incredible how rapidly it all fell off so nobody really knew in September that we were actually in a recession and you know they date the recessions it uh it's always a historical look back\nSo a lot of people and a lot of people were saying well it's it's a downturn but we didn't know was going to fall off the cliff the way it did yeah I was thinking that back then uh uh\nWhat I noticed as an early warning sign was the days on market for housing in New Hampshire which started was starting to increase [noise] but you also have to remember there was a tremendous positive momentum going into two thousand eight home prices had almost doubled since the year two thousand in New Hampshire was phenomenal\nFor days on market means how many days they would stay on the market\nYeah that was starting to rise up and I saw that in two thousand fry two thousand six and commented on it then that this is a little scary\nAnd then all of these no dark loans uh where people didn't have to document their income they could just say well I think I make about a hundred and fifty thousand a year well that's great you qualify for a mortgage\nSo the interesting thing about this recession I think one of the interesting things looking back is that it was a bottoms up recession meaning that it started\nIn the mortgage offices of people who were getting into mortgages that they really couldn't sustain that would be a teaser rate you only have to pay ... percent a an interest rate but what was in the fine print words that's going to go up to five or six percent in two years and when that happened people just pulled back\nYou started having our recession losing jobs losing income and ah one thing tripped over the other to the point where are we really got into a very serious mass\nWell and we heard President Bush in that clip earlier saying you know here's all the stuff that's happening but then he says I'm not mistaken is taking decisive action\nOn that financial and you mentioned Ross um so that decisive action was the troubled Asset Relief program better notice the tarp or the bank bailout and boy we did lots of shows about that that was very controversial so I just want to play a little clip from the president saying Congress really needs to pass this\nThis rescue effort is not aimed at preserving any individual company or industry it is aimed at preserving America's overall economy\nIt will help American consumers and businesses get credit to meet their daily needs and create jobs and it will help send a signal to markets around the world\nThat America's financial system is back on track\nAnd I know you all remember this and the big debate at that time in ... seconds he want to jump in is that you know is this for Wall Street or main street there is the president saying this is for main street but\nA lot of people thought okay this is a Wall Street bailout and we don't like that\nYeah we needed to have a Wall Street bailout unfortunately it would've been a lot better if the if the aid could have been direct to or those homeowners but what was happening was that these mortgages were packaged together a lot of them were unsustainable they were sold internationally and the entire financial um [noise]\nI mean who doesn't love I knew I had almost as much as you love the exchange right I mean when you make that donation those dollars go directly into programs just like the exchange\nAnd

P. R. dot org again exchange at an H. P. R. dot word you can always respond on Facebook or Twitter at an HBO exchange and gentlemen before we go to our listeners I Do have a couple of comments I Want to share with you\nWe've talked a lot of housing and and the financial sector Jeff let's look at manufacturing um during the recession was a lot of emphasis on the hit that manufacturing and construction took some even called it a man's sessions since these industries tend to be dominated by men I remember during the whole show on that\nOne of these sectors in particular tickets so hard just well first of all we were talking a lot about about the\nIn the U.S market in New Hampshire we had a serious issue and that without credit you can't get a mortgage and that really affected the housing market severely and when you can't win you can't get 'em or you can't buy a house you can't build houses and that that's\nIn a nutshell what happened with construction industry but manufacturing is a little more complicated but what it was that\nAre in New Hampshire in particular are manufacturing sector is very very much reliant on exports internationally\nAnd as I said this was an international uh a risk recession and what happened was we actually we started seeing signs earlier in two thousand eight in two thousand seven of some weakness in exports such slowing down and\nWhat happened was that just exacerbate it it became a major it's the you know it just exporting export market just tumbles and what that affected the uh the employment of people in in manufacturing\nYeah hold on to around all around the ... of the country the export sector and as long as people don't realize that you know you think exports soy beans or something but New Hampshire does have a strong experts\nHave to go ahead Brian well manufacturing always takes it in a recession um it's a you know if they want less stuff if it exactly demand falls it's cyclical sensitive\nNew Hampshire has still and at that time did still has a higher percentage of manufacturing in its economy than than most states I mean we were falling off a lot but we're still more manufacturing dependent\nI'm so in ... when you look at what we manufacture we manufacture a lot of capital goods capital goods as opposed to consumer goods there are things that are made\nThat are sold up businesses that use them to make\nOther products or component or larger products or services or provide services\nSo when you look at what happened in the recession or you know business investment fell off dramatically\nAnd as a result our manufacturing because it was so dependent on on Capitol goods\nWhat's it even harder so we saw about a Fifteen to sixteen percent decline in our manufacturing employment during the recession that's a lot yeah it it ... the U.S economy saw a lot too but we were worse in and construction we're a little bit thirty percent decline in construction during we lost about eight thousand manufacturing jobs was\nThirty percent of the major or the construction jobs in New Hampshire\nMaybe a lot of those people just left and you mentioned earlier that now that yeah orders of construction workers maybe a lot of them just to have a lot of it at first they you know they look they look for employment\nAnd other opportunities which are worth a lot of but a lot of them did moving in or they change careers and we have really never got them all back we haven't gotten that\nWell the other thing was that you have to remember in Nineteen Ninety One or New Hampshire went through a really much more serious and a real estate depression nearly a year and a lot of those people just left they moved to a ... areas west and in Ninety One so we already had an a deficit and construction workers because I had rats yeah I was\nGoing to say you know you look for early warning signs one of them was manufacturing I mean we lost twenty six thousand twenty seven thousand manufacturing jobs leading into the recession in New Hampshire so\nIt was an early warning sign that these good high paying breadwinner jobs were vaporizing and where they vaporized too was trying to\nThe economic policy Institute looked at jobs lost the China an estimated them New Hampshire was in the top five I think states in terms of the hit we took with the basically exporting of manufacturing activity to China or in during the decade of the two\nThousand so some of those jobs right ... people have said well maybe not all of them are lost to other markets they lost due to um automation and those jobs would've been gone anyway that it's a little too simple to just say they went over there well maybe outlets out\nOf them did if you look at some of the firm's we lost like cable Tron for example\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from community minded Fenton family dealerships serving keen swans and all of Chester county giving back to the community for over Thirty years ...

P. R. I'm Laura ... today or New Hampshire economic news round up his back and we've been digging deeper into the past looking at the recession which hit New Hampshire about a decade ago when the stock market crashed on September twenty two thousand eight and\nAll that has been out since then but we're also looking ahead to hound hamsters economy has changed and as we're hearing from our guests have been some very\nGood announcements about the New Hampshire economy recently we'd love to get your thoughts one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven send us an email exchange it and H. P. R. dot org again and H. P. R.\nDot org and um all of you so we've been talking about the announcement by be a systems four hundred jobs coming in we've been talking about dean Caymans\nA army the advanced a region or ...\nIt's jobs coming in we've been looking at the Manchester area larger than just the city itself and how ready it is and I wonder what you think ... the first but when he was never Betty how are these employment issues is workforce issues affecting the hamsters longstanding debates over our transportation system which is basically wrote in cars\nYeah I I think it's really significant because you know one\nCommuting times have gotten longer I sort of tracked us over the last few decades and almost every county\nIn the state in every community commuting times have gotten longer and longer um all these issues are inter related because if you can't have people living near where they work which you know we don't seem to do a great job of having\nYou know a lot of housing located in places that are are expanding their employment then you've got to move people from where they live to where they work and that's how you kind of balance out where there's places where there's extra excess labor or available labor with the places that are\nAdding a lot of jobs but don't have enough people I was in Keene doing a presentation last week\nAnd you know it's a wonderful place to live a love that community just great and they're you know they're they're complaining about and rightly so about the lack of jobs and lack of their housing prices are lower\nUm the problem is and they've got talent there the problem is it's really hard for those people to work in Manchester you know it's not easy to travel route one on one so you know\nMaybe the flip side of that is not such a bad thing because you you build it at home you can't get to Boston easily it we can't get to Manchester easily you can't get to ... probably like you build it at home\nYeah boil unfortunately they're not building it at home there but they continue to build it in the places where there is you know there is in a ... effect where there's\nA lot of employers so they're going to continue to build in the Manchester area they're going to continue in London there they're going to continue to build in Portsmouth and places like teen are are you know are are missing out and yet it's a it's a place that could help solve the housing\nSituation because there is available housing at a relatively affordable prices but you got to move people so we're not unless we have people living more people living where they work we're going to have to figure out how to move them hopefully not by just by cars public transportation which again\nIs a real mess in the state they're just really is almost no public chance with the exception to the seacoast has a little bit of it because you've got the train would shops in Durham Exeter in Dover right now three stops that he actually got the train we've got pretty good bus service\nAnd we've got inter community bus service over there so it actually is pretty effective but most places aren't like that\nSo when I Lived in Keene L A long time ago I'm Talking decades ago rafts there was better transportation to Boston back then and there is now and\nAnd when I Lived in Manchester decades ago there was better transportation around the city I took the bus to the library when I was a kid so I mean I think that the pattern a development in the state has been driven by the automobile\nWe've we're spending a zillion dollars on Ninety three were about to spend another ... billion dollars on the turnpike\nUh on uh the Ninety three through conquered but uh we were right in the news this week or last week about a firm in Salem that is leaving me it's not a large firm but his leaving because of the lack of a train access to a broader labor force so\nUm we continue to put a lot of money into the automobile that the parent in the development of the state favors the automobile this favors a public transportation and\nWell and we're having cars people say as these come on the market and more and more people will say forget sticking to that trainer bus schedule you know I'm I don't want to leave at six o'clock in the morning I'll leave it takes Fifteen\nA lot more on bicycles too\nSir and it will actually you know actually a lot of hurdles bike into peace to commute by by kind of the law says that we know they know that they work there or they weren't though right because they they buy into pieces this this I don't know how how\nMany people are but this does quite a few that do that every day uh it I have to say uh as I also was a ... I was a former resident of keen many years ago\nAnd this discussion gene it's not necessarily by choice that keen is so isolated one of the main reasons is that route one on one has expanded many years ago for Manchester the seacoast but ... one on one from keen to Manchester is uh is is\nA Nineteen forties wrote in and that's really a been one of the problems I Keenan says\nWell we did a whole series this summer I'm called going local where we looked at the different strengths and ah drawbacks of each region and that's definitely came up when we did our ... knock region show which actually to to to our own horn a little bit we did live before an audience that keen state college that was really great\nWABC Gore won a certain point one\nW E v J Jackson Ninety nine point five W\nE v a cobra Ninety going through and W.

rest ... president of applied economic research\nAnd economic and real estate consulting firm in the county and respond back with the banks well gentleman just sort of put us in the time machine and go back a decade\nLet's hear a little bit from a speech from then President Bush\nThis is on September twenty fourth\nTwo thousand eight so right around this time and here he is acknowledging the deep deep economic anxiety many Americans were feeling at that time\nWe've seen triple digit swings in the stock market major financial institutions have cheated on the edge of collapse\nAnd some of failed\nAs an certainly has grown many banks have restricted the lending credit markets are frozen and families and businesses are founded harder to borrow money we're in the midst of a serious financial crisis and the federal government is responding with decisive action\nAgain that's President Bush September twenty four two thousand eight and intimate God's will talk about what that decisive action was but rest just jumping in a time machine what do you remember from that time as an economist what were you looking at\nWas really frightening when Lehman Brothers collapsed we were on the verge of really an international pressure and I think that the the interesting thing and looking back from today is that it really did become a bipartisan type ...\nOr did it and Obama continued it but it was very when Lehman Brothers failed burst earns right on the verge of failing banks just pulled back and weren't lending people we are ah\nA nationally you know a a having a very difficult time finding credit here in New Hampshire during the downturn we had maybe twenty twenty five thousand homes go through foreclosure we lost personal income for the first time in years thirty thousand jobs evaporated so it was really um [noise]\nUh it's called the great recession and that there wasn't a big difference between the great recession and another depression at that time that was the fear\nWell a little bit later we'll dig into some of the state focus details you mentioned um rats and I'm Glad you mentioned housing and financial institution so it's definitely talk about those what you're looking at ten years ago Brian uh [noise]\nI feel like I was a fighter pilot I've never flown a jet fighter but um when all those alarm start going off you know and all the the light start linking that's kind of the way\nI felt there were so many things that we're going wrong at that time uh five days before the stock market crashed I did a presentation September twenty four to a bank board of trustees the same day we played that clip from yeah go ahead so I said I was really nervous um you know you saw\nUh the delinquency that were rising you saw banks that we're starting to get runs where the positives were so worried they were withdrawing their savings and I said you know this is really\nScary um you know and I wonder if this is going to happen in New Hampshire and the bank president interrupted me and he said Brian I spent all morning talking to my depositors who had called wondering if they should take their money out of our bank that's how scary it was and that's a small community bank in New Hampshire wow\nWhat were you looking at Jeff you know actually it's interesting because I Know that we did a lot of reporting going back about two thousand seven about eight or more over a year before that about this a rash of a lot of people who who homeowners would be underwater and they had these a\nFancy mortgages they were that that we later found out that he gave the names subprime and people who really probably should act mortgages yet and they probably shouldn't have had an home August they'd they'd been buying homes for three hundred thousand dollars in their income was nowhere near that ability to pay for that and it was mostly throughout one ... one company called country why which was one of the casualties of this uh [noise]\nI guess they call the great recession but it was at the time we felt like it was a depression and it was that kind of a frightening or era ... the other thing that that was striking was we track bankruptcies every month and\nGoing out around the time of leaving you know after that the all of a sudden you started knowing noticing an uptick in personal biography bankruptcies and business bankruptcies in New Hampshire\nAnd it was starting to rise it obviously became much worse oh nine ten eleven but it's not we started seeing that and and things have been going so well in New Hampshire and and around the country like it was almost like what's going on here as it is like is like noticing something's wrong with you see dripping come out of your roof all of a sudden like oh my God\nIt's going to cut thought gee maybe I should have noticed that there yeah ... yeah it's ... it's a little nicer there things and you know and then we talk\nTo people who are saying well you know everything's fine you know the answer is going to be resilient you know they gave us the same old stuff they usually give us\nBut as Brian and and Russia are saying you know you know there's something with an apprehension offense set of apprehension\nFed right you know if we didn't know we were in a recession and September of of two thousand I mean things were looking bad and and the numbers were were falling off clearly but you know during that first nine months we lost a couple of thousand jobs in New Hampshire then you look at what happened after the end of September\n... eight nine ten thousand jobs were lost in the next four or five months it was incredible how ...\nSo nobody really knew in September that we were actually in a recession and you know they date the recessions it it's always a historical look back so a lot of people and a lot of people were saying well it's it's a downturn but we didn't know it was going to fall off the cliff the way it did yeah I was just thinking that back then uh uh\nWhat I noticed as an early warning sign was the days on market for housing in New Hampshire which started was starting to increase [noise] but you also have to remember there was a tremendous positive momentum going into two thousand eight home prices had almost doubled since the year two thousand in New Hampshire was phenomenal\nFor days on market means how many days they would stay on the market yeah\nThat was starting to rise up and I saw that in two thousand two thousand six and commented on it then that this is a little scary\nAnd then all of these no dark loans uh where people didn't have to document their income they could just say well I think I make about a hundred and fifty thousand a year well that's great you qualify for a mortgage\nSo the interesting thing about this recession I think one of the interesting things looking back is that it was a bottom up recession meaning that it started\nIn the mortgage offices of people who were getting into mortgages that they really couldn't sustain that would be a teaser rate you only have to pay two percent a an interest rate but what was in the fine print what's that's going to go up to five or six percent two years and when that happened people just pulled back\nYou started having our recession losing jobs losing income and ah one thing tripped over the other to the point where are we really got into a very serious mess\nWell and we heard President Bush in that clip earlier saying you know here's all the stuff that's happening but then he says I'm ... taking decisive action\nOn that financial and you mentioned Ross um so that decisive action was the troubled Asset Relief program that I've noticed the tarp or the bank bailout what we did lots of shows about that that was very controversial\nSo I just want to play a little clip from the president saying Congress really needs to pass this\nThis rescue effort is not aimed at preserving any individual company or industry it is aimed at preserving America's overall economy\nIt will help American consumers and businesses get credit to meet their daily needs and create jobs and it will help send a signal to markets around the world\nThat America's financial system is back on track\nAnd I know you all remember this and the big debate at that time in ... seconds he want to jump in is that you know is this for Wall Street or main street there the president saying this is for main street\nA lot of people thought okay this is a Wall Street bailout and we don't like that\nYeah we needed to have a Wall Street bailout unfortunately it would've been a lot better if the if the aid could have been direct to or those homeowners but what was happening was that these mortgages were packaged together a lot of them were unsustainable they were sold internationally and the entire financial um [noise]\nBut it took us ten years and it was long and slow area ... now the second longest recovery in history but probably the slowest recovery and history so\nBut getting to um uh Brian's point about housing shortages new construction I did the math on how many jobs we've added since the bond trough of the recession which is around fifty or fifty five thousand that's that's really a good performance for the state [noise]\nBut if you do the math on how okay so how many houses should we are bad we come up with a shortage of around twenty thousand housing units to service the\nJob growth we've had and to put that into perspective I don't want to keep rattling off numbers because they're hard to listen to\nBut twenty thousand is the shortage and we're only building three or four thousand a year so we it would take six years if nothing else changed to get back to a balanced housing market the shorter and that's by one measure\nUp yeah go ahead and I say one of the thing what one of the other major hurdles in in the creation of a housing for you know work workforce housing for lesbian Michael is that\nCommunities still have this blind spot about building a multi family housing you know you see keep on saying let's have fifty five and older which is great but you know one thing the hamsters and they just want fifty five and older people [noise]\nBut I did they have this problem with ... they still have it it's it's it's not based on reality that you know that\nPeople with ... with a young family is going to cost you more money that's not that's not what the reality is as it used to be they seem less has been shown time and time again but communities have these these ah these planning and zoning laws that just prevent construction of these kind of housing unit\nYeah the sales you'd have a lot of companies that are some that have\nSome that have had that have got to have really come come up and and but that's but the problem is that is a state wide problem and it's not just in certain but\nOne a few but it's going to be at the community level that those decisions influence what happens demographically what happened ... population wise and you see it a ... you know we talk about these problems as if their state problems that they're really local issues\nAnd each community has a lot more control over what can happen in terms of its demographics than we give it credit we keep looking for state policies when in fact we should all that ... that was\nA real problem is that if you ask any bills or you know if they know what towns of stay away from other or they'll know towns all have a really hard time with\nWell eventually they'll Brian communities like conquered Dover I'm guessing that do invest in this moderate income housing they'll start to attract the younger families they'll start to have the vibrancy and the other countries will go whoa what's going on I mean at some point right\nYeah you know what you would ... that you hope there's there's a paper on out there\nCommunities and what they're doing their successes I'm I'm hoping\nYou never know [noise] All right well we have a lot more to talk about\nOn our New Hampshire economic news roundup in just a moment we come back to the final don't ask you about manufacturing\nWhat happened

P. R. dot org again exchange at N. H. P. R. dot org you can always respond on Facebook or Twitter at an HBO exchange and gentlemen before we go to our listeners I Do have a couple of comments I Want to share with you\nWe've talked a lot of housing and and the financial sector Jeff let's look at manufacturing um during the recession was a lot of emphasis on the hit that manufacturing and construction took some even called it a man's sessions since these industries tend to be dominated by men I remember doing a whole show on that one of these\nFactors in particular tickets so heart jak well first of all we were talking a lot about about the lack of a credit\nIn in in in the U.S market in New Hampshire we had a serious issue and that without credit you can't get a mortgage and that really affected the housing market severely and when you get when you can't get them you can't buy a house you can't build houses and that that's\nYou know I'm not sure what happened was construction industry but manufacturing is a little more complicated but what it was that\nAre in New Hampshire in particular are manufacturing sector is very very much relied on exports internationally\nAnd as I said this was an international uh uh ... recession and what happened was we actually we would start seeing signs earlier in two thousand eight in two thousand seven of some weakness in exports such slowing down and\nWhat happened was that just exacerbated it became a major ... you know\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think\nThis at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more starting with Hitchcock is here it\nExactly demand falls it's cyclical sensitive New Hampshire has still and at that time did still has a higher percentage of manufacturing in its economy than than most states I mean we we falling off a lot but we're still more manufacturing dependent\nI'm so in ... when you look at what we manufacture we manufacture a lot of capital goods capital goods as opposed to consumer goods there are things that are made\nThat are sold up businesses that use them to make\nOther products or component or larger ... or services or provide services so when you look at what happened in the recession or you know business investment fell off dramatically\nAnd as a result our manufacturing because it was so dependent on on Capitol goods\nWas it even harder so we saw about a Fifteen\nTo sixteen percent decline in our manufacturing employment during the recession that's a lot yeah it it ... the U.S economy saw a lot too but we were worse in construction we're a little bit thirty percent decline in construction during we lost about eight thousand manufacturing jobs was thirty percent of the major or the construction jobs in New Hampshire\nMaybe a lot of those people just left right and you mentioned earlier that now that yeah orders of construction workers maybe a lot of them just to have a lot of it at first they you know they look they look for employment\nAnd other up opportunities which are worth a lot of but a lot of them did moving in or they changed careers and we have really never got them all back we haven't\nGot it on the other thing was that you have to remember in Nineteen Ninety One or New Hampshire went through a really much more serious a real estate depression nearly a year and a lot of those people just left they moved to A L SATs southern areas west and in Ninety One so we already had a deficit in in construction workers because I had math yeah I was\nGoing to say you know you look for early warning signs one of them was manufacturing I mean we lost twenty six thousand twenty seven thousand manufacturing jobs leading into the recession\nIn New Hampshire so it was an early warning sign that these good high paying breadwinner jobs were vaporizing and where they vaporized too was trying to\nThe economic policy Institute looked at jobs lost to China an estimated them the hamster was in the top five I think states in terms of the hit we took with the basically exporting of manufacturing activity to China or in during the decade of the two\nThousand and some of those jobs right ... people have said well maybe not all of them are lost to other markets they lost due to um automation and those jobs that have been gone anyway that it's a little too simple to just say they went over there well maybe outlets out\nA lot of them did if you look at some of the firm's we lost like cable Tron for example that was building component says Brian said\nA lot of them were I mean you could almost say you can almost take a string and draw the line from Rochester New Hampshire to maybe Shanghai, China really contract not not all of them you are right Laura but but a a sizable portion of our manufacturing activity was vulnerable to a resurgence in the Chinese economy\nThe other thing that they did which was the purchasing other long term mortgage backed securities\nEr they provided liquidity if a a a bank and Germany was concerned about their their their mortgage portfolio that they had bought into properly erroneous lead the fed said look don't worry we'll buy it\nAnd we'll give you cash that you can link to other people will take that on ourselves and that still lives I was like an eighty trillion dollar balance sheet or the fed which is unprecedented\nSo the main thing is they gave liquidity to the market they gay validity little way out is cash yeah if you were trapped in a closet as they are locked the door so you could get out of the problem\nAnd and function more normally normally and it was a it was a great ... Ben Bernanke he did a great job and as I think a verdict really an international disaster\nThere were still international problems Greece we've heard remake remembers Spain\nOr where lenders just said look you're too risky you got too much debt we're not going in there anymore\nSo there were there were still problems and locally it was more um on the on the mortgage side of things so a local banks felt the crunch too yes\nBut ah the interesting thing is that the stress which I think primarily focused on Wall street the problems in New Hampshire word created by New Hampshire banks they were created by mortgage companies\nOut of state mortgage companies and I think New Hampshire banks are just mentioned the Nineteen Ninety downturn learned a lesson that and we didn't lose any banks in this downturn it became much\nMore cautious guy had to say though ... at one of the ... in the fall out of this was I remember talking to several bankers or if I guess it was about two thousand nine I mean maybe two thousand ten\nBut the the ... had been for at least a couple of years how difficult it was with small businesses to get any kind of financing that was going on for a long time it was really hard for a business to get financing from that banks because the rules have changed\nAnd they ... they ... the banks this community banks that they their hands were tied and they couldn't\nThey may maybe would have a few years earlier and that that was really something that they that that really hamstrung New Hampshire in terms of any kind of ability to for these companies to grow as with the way they want it to and\nI took all as taking a long time to to get out of that whole mess because it's was a mess was a very difficult to get any kind of low\n... thank you for the email and for the reminder I'd forgotten about\nSome of those things that you mentioned so thank you dean and coming up I Want to pull together all these trends that we've talked about um including the workforce trends and the housing trends and so forth and ask how it might affect debates over transportation\nHere in New Hampshire there a couple of interesting headlines about that just recently so that is coming up and keep it right here this is the exchange on HBO [noise]\nKnowing what's happening in the mid term elections before you vote in November is important\nBut what about what's going to happen in December or January Hi I'm Lawrence ... housing in policy reporter for any young when you give each month as a ... and you will an H.

R.\nDot org and um all of you so we've been talking about uh the announcement by be a system is four hundred jobs coming in with been talking about dean Caymans\nA army the advanced uh regenerative tissue manufacturing Institute and all those jobs coming in we've been looking at the Manchester area larger than just the city itself and how ready it is and I wonder what you think ... the first one here from everybody\nHow are these employment issues these workforce issues affecting you have to his longstanding debates over our transportation system which is basically rows and cars\nKnow I I think it's really significant because you know one\nCommuting times have gotten longer I I sort of tracked us over the last few decades and almost every county\nIn the state in every community commuting times have gotten longer and longer um all these issues are inter related because if you can't have people living near where they work which you know we don't seem to do a great job of having you know a lot of housing located in places that are are\nWhere they lived to where they work and that's how you kind of balance out where there's places where there's extra excess labor or available labor with the places that are adding a lot of jobs but don't have enough people I was in Keene doing a presentation last week\nAnd you know it's a wonderful place to live a love that community just great and they're ... you know they're they're complaining about and rightly so about the lack of jobs and lack of their housing prices are lower\nUm the problem is and they've got talent there the problem is it's really hard for those people to work in Manchester you know it's not easy to travel route one on one so you know maybe\nThe flip side of that is not such a bad thing because you you build it at home you can't get to Boston easily it wouldn't get to Manchester easily you can't get to ... probably like you build it at home\nYeah boil unfortunately they're not building it at home there but they continue to build it in the places where there you know there's been a ... effect where there's\nA lot of employers who they're going to continue to build in the Manchester area they're going to continue in London there they're going to continue to build in Portsmouth and places like teen are are you know are are missing out and yet it's a it's a place that could help solve the housing\nA situation because there is available housing at a relatively affordable prices but you got to move people so we're not unless we have people living more people living where they work we're going to have to figure out how to move them hopefully not by just by cars public transportation which again\nIs a real mess in the state they're just really is almost no public chance with the exception to the seacoast has a little bit of it because you've got the train which shops in Durham Exeter in Dover right sale three stops that exactly we got the train we've got pretty good bus service\nAnd we've got inter community bus service over there so it actually is pretty effective but most places aren't like\nThat so when I Lived in Keene L A long time ago I'm Talking decades ago rafts there was better transportation to Boston back then and there is now and\nAnd when I Lived in Manchester decades ago there was better transportation around the city I took the bus to the library when I was a kid so I mean I think that the pattern a development in the state has been driven by the automobile\nUh we were spending ... billion dollars on Ninety three were about to spend another ... billion dollars on the turnpike\nOn a Ninety three through conquered but uh we were right in the news this week or last week about a firm in Salem that is leaving because it's not a large firm but his leaving because of the lack of a train access to a broader labor force so\nUm we continue to put a lot of money into the automobile that the parent in the development in the states favors the automobile this favors a public transportation and\nWell and we're having cars people say as these come on the market more and more people will say forget sticking to that trainer bus schedule you know I'm I don't want to leave at six o'clock in the morning I'll leave it takes Fifteen we're seeing a lot more on bicycles too and I know that that person will last area that will actually you know actually a lot of her will buy\nInto peace to commute by ... is that we know they know that they work there all the work that we're a peace they bike into pieces to this this\nI don't know how how many people are but this this quite a few that do that every day uh it I have to say or as I also was a ... I was a former resident of keen many years ago\nAnd this discussion keen it's not necessarily by choice that keen is so isolated one of the main reasons is that ... one on one has expanded many years ago from Manchester the seacoast but ... one on one from keen to Manchester is uh is is\nA Nineteen forties wrote in and that's really been one of the problems I Keenan says\nWe did a whole series this summer I'm called going local where we looked at the different\nRegion and that's definitely came up when we did our ... knock region show which actually to to to our own little that we did live before an audience of ... state college it was really great lots more people in the jumping to our conversation I'm so let's go back to our listeners and Jill's calling in from Peterborough Joe good to hear from you you're on the economic round up welcome", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "01"}
