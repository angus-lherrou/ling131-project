P. R. dot org\nAgain exchange at an age PR dot toward respond on Facebook or Twitter at an HBO exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven and ...\n... what can the exchange going to feel good to see lower than it was at a time about this very ordinary event the guy comes over installs your water heater it's completely a normal thing that anyone might experience but it kind of made you go oh my gosh or a hot\nSo I mean the it happened obviously in a moment in that moment has you know for for years I had been reading headlines right about\nClimate change and global warming and this idea that we need to stop consuming so much and yet ah in two thousand Thirteen my wife and I were to younger children had bought a home in Durham New Hampshire a Nineteen sixty eight ranch and it needed some updating and as part of that seems to put it in a new natural gas\nAnd I was hanging out in the basement with Joel who was installing the furnace\nAnd he was saying this is going to be a you know efficient and it's going to be cheap because of a natural gas prices were low and it was all true and yet there was this kind of cognitive disconnect between this is the very thing that we're learning we're supposed to be doing less of right which is consuming fossil fuels\nAnd here I was paying thousands of dollars a to basically essentially connect myself\nMore permanently to that system\nAnd the second piece of that was an from Pennsylvania originally and a Pennsylvania is one of the areas that has essentially been re defined by fracking hydraulic fracturing and this drilling which on the one hand has provided a lot more natural gas has cheapened the cost of that energy but at the same time\nUh has again committed us sort of deeper down a road of fossil fuel consumption and so I was standing in my basement wondering like what's going on out there I'm I'm a journalist by background and I had done a lot of that kind of field reporting\nAnd I thought you know that's something that I could maybe offer in this conversation about where we are is to go to the source um and so\nYou know I sort of metaphorically and symbolically followed the pipe across the roof or the or across the feeling of the basement and out the door and thought you know I Want to go to sort of see what's happening in these places where all this has produced\nWell it's so easy to consume energy and here in New Hampshire we don't have a lot of home grown energy sources but if you travel anywhere you know California you see these\nGiant um wind farms on the brown hills I'm Out there traveled to other places Oklahoma you see this sort of you know rigs pumping up and down here in New England were kind of disconnected from where our energy comes from\nAbsolutely and so in a sense I mean that was that was at the heart of what I was feeling was almost this over insulation right I mean we live in this modern era and I'm thankful for modern medicine I drove over here in a car that all I had to do I could hold my coffee in my hand and push a little gas pedal and I I traverse the state right where the Jersey it'll effort [noise]\nUm but as you point out you know we don't often see the transaction of that where things come from\nUm obviously in an earlier era of people were chopping wood or you know out there a kind of getting their own fuel and in many parts of the world today still but in working hard to get that working hard to get it there was a sort of an involvement in the transaction right between sort of what you needed to survive and how you were living\nAnd now because of modern technology because of this industrial where we live in you know we're just we're insulated within that we don't see it and even\nMore conceptually many of us or if you work in an office and your paycheck goes direct deposit your bank account and if you have payment for your electric bill set up you don't even know how much you've consumed how much you've paid you've never seen the money you've earned you've never seen that go out to pay\nSo again a lot of convenience in some ways in those systems but the net result is\nThat we're we're over instantly like who you just don't feel that that sense in at a time sort of as a society I think when we need to be more aware of that\nWell why does closing that disconnect or opening up that\nInsulation I think as you put it Tom why does that matter some of these energy landscapes are quite an attractive and even unhealthy\nYeah I think that I mean you know for for a while we were able to maybe not let it matter as a society when we didn't know the costs right but we've learned I think at the heart of the\nKind of climate change can under him is that uh we've learned that we need to be more aware of what we're consuming and how and by the way I mean whether it's carbon based or not a man how much and so I think I just felt you know I think that collectively or we need to be more aware that so that we can follow certain policy pads\nBut also just individually I don't know about you I I teach at UNH I was talking to a group of college students about this but there is a certain uh helplessness to this ... this installation when we you know you read the headline it almost doesn't matter you know two weeks ago\nThe UN or international panel on climate change came out and said well this is happening faster than we thought\nOh we're going to be seeing some really significant impacts by twenty forty and I looked around the room with college students that how would you guys be twenty forty and they were like thirty eight now during the mind right so we're not talking just you know grandkids grandkids are we are talking now essentially\nAnd so I kind of felt I'm just on a personal level kind of helpless you know in the basement they're like wow I'm I'm paying you know lots of money for this I don't know how this all works\nUm and so for me as just a writer and in in this journey I mean I think what I was trying to do was almost to kind of you know information is power\nRight is it was the kind of try to understand it and feel a little less helpless\nWell is information power because um you're right it's so big and the predictions are so dire um is it power or is it power less ness to understand what's going on\nA little bit of both I mean I have to admit I mean we can talk about the journeys and a second but I'm you know being out there you know I sort of went to these fossil fuel landscapes first and it became a sort of a reckoning of of\nHow much we consume and I tell you I was on an oil rig and just seeing what is done on one rig or in one little corner of the United states which was one little corner of the world in terms of global oil production\nI'm On an afternoon I was there a Memorial Day twenty thousand two thousand fourteen\nUm to just to fill gas tanks for that moment um you know what I guess what it gave me though was a sort of an appreciation and a sense of what we need to overcome which in a way increased in my mind sort of the urgency of the situation um\nBecause it is that the amazing thing of living inside a our world of you know sort of on the receiving end of the fuel is it's pretty calm world you know you kind of these these problems seem theoretical and when\nI was in the bucket oilfield of North Dakota for example and thousands of people are drilling hundreds of rigs or you know for for oil which has increased by fifty percent us oil production that in ... in other places\nAnd again the you know in the short term has some potentially positive impacts people will say hey it's cheaper fuel energy independence et cetera\nBut you sit there and you and you kind of feel on an organic level that we're digging deeper at a time and we shouldn't be so I Do want to get in yeah if it landscapes\nThat you walk through and that's great and I want to let listeners oil fields of fracking natural gas\nSolar wind Tom kind of explored it all on foot and we'll hear about that in well I also want to remind you that you can join us our number here in the exchange one

H. P. R. dot org\nAgain exchange and each P. R. dot org was found on Facebook or Twitter at an HBO exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven and a time just before the break um we were talking about a year trip here first let's get that you walk through the oil fields of North Dakota\nAnd I was asking you about how the people there felt about the changes in their lives from this you know sudden rush of oil production and you said there were you know definitely negatives\nBut also a lot of positives yeah I mean first of all just kind of set the scene so this area of North Dakota is wide open right I'm rugged land\nI'm sort of the classic windswept prairie right and I'm over the last century there had been sort of a boom of family farming from the early Nineteen hundreds and there were communities sprung up I Walk to a place called Charleston North Dakota and McCain's accounting that had been home to more than three hundred people in the Nineteen forties and fifties um but since then\nThe big sort of a western reaches\nA it was hard to keep the family farm farming got more industrialized and so in Charles so now they're for families effectively farming the same amount of land\nUm so you know a lot of my point is that this is these are communities out of which a lot of people have moved a lot of young people have gone off to the release you know we're all the ... a lot of area a lot of areas and if you've ever seen one of those National Geographic issues of of North Dakota you know the sort of the sideways leaning barn with the roof started ... you know a lot of that right\nI'm at the same time a lot of big industrial scale farming going on soybeans or spring wheat or whatever but\nIt was into that that sort of a terrain that the oil boom came right and so\nUm you had basically then I you know I I just depended on who you talk to but there were some ranchers who um it's a place that has a tradition of kind of that land as a resource rates oil's a resource so yes if someone came in and drilled in their land there was a psychology of like that's what we're supposed to be doing\nA it gives us you know money my kids can stay around um but again as I was explaining to without getting too far North Dakota law there's mineral rights in some farmers didn't even own the mineral rights their land so\nThese are not a sort of subtle thing and they were talking two hundred and fifty foot a high a drilling rig coming in drilling two miles down two miles over and leaving an operating well sometimes within if I'm remembering correctly I think they can drill within two hundred and fifty feet or five hundred feet of a farmhouse\nSo there are as you know some people who\nWere used to the high lonely planes and their way of life to all of a sudden had an industrial zone right around the house well it's\nThat it's that the ... you talked about that disconnect between energy consumption and energy production um and how most of us especially here in New England don't really see that but if you're in North Dakota farmer and all of a sudden there's an oil rig in your visual backyard you're not disconnected anymore it's right there\nYou're not just going to even though that oil might be going off to a to a processing plant in Texas right but you were\nYou ... you were basically all of a sudden in the backyard of American energy industry right and so the other interesting thing about North Dakota is North Dakota farmers need water and they have a great appreciation for the table water and the water that as a ... also as a resource and clean water specifically\nSo there there was a lot more awareness and uncertainty of people I talked to a while this is great but boy we're pumping millions of gallons of water into these wells to frack them with chemicals\nAnd we're not sure what's going on there I talked to one rancher Donny Nelson who's you know third generation both grandparents kinda homesteaded et cetera um who just said look you're talking about human beings and machines and things will go wrong you know and so there was a\nI think on that kind of you know organic level of nervousness there among some people that um you know this is all this land is all we got right and they were ripping it up a literally to to get the oil out um you know they will be the ones who pay for that\nIt's going to our listeners then I'm going to talk about these other landscapes that you walk through although I'm really intrigued by some of these stories about North Dakota I've got a lot more about that but other landscapes that Tom Haynes walk through include um natural gas in Pennsylvania and New York where the sensibility about natural gas is different\nAlso hole in Wyoming Southern California so we'll talk about all that and you can join us to one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven send us an email exchange at an H. P. R. dot org I'm Tom Linda's on the line from Durham your home town highland go ahead you're on the air welcome\nAnd thanks for taking my call I just wonder why not one thing that we haven't talked about as a as a local source of energy which is still thermal uh I think most people don't realize that I'm\nAt just five feet down into the earth that earth at ... degrees and geothermal heating systems right like cats\nIt worked terrific and or in the northeast uh and I had a ... a system plenty out when I bought my house uh about four years ago and it's keeping the coasts\nEver sense why it replaced propane\nUm and it's harvesting heat and it can either be if you have some open land you could just take a thought what the trench or if you just have a small lot you can I have a well driller a drill a hole to put the piping down into the ground to harvest that he\nUh you do have a little more electricity to run the heat pumps that concentrates heat and bring it up a buck fifty thought to form your house um but I put in solar panels to harvest the sun to do that and now I'm basically not burning off the\nField to keep my home and it is very called New England winter\nAnd you are definitely not disconnected from your energy sources there Linda it's All right there in her home did you get to geothermal there isn't really a geothermal landscape that you can walk through right I I didn't look into geothermal but first of all I think you know when does absolutely\nRight and I think um you know that's awesome to be using that resource and I think that's a kind of thing we need to be doing is sort of exploring both local and industrial scale stuff or whether it's backyard energy out of something like geothermal\nUm and the reason why I did was I was primarily concerned is sort of just ... as sort of uh the yang to the you know fossil fuels to going to these\nI'm looking at sources that could kind of on an industrial level the degree in geothermal ... absolutely can't to um it was just I had to stop somewhere but I Do think to to Linda's point um it's important that places where we can be pushing the boundaries of both\nUm both the technology that's being used but also kind of the um the affordability of it the more people who are using geothermal in their homes that creates a market for it these companies will go after it [noise] um anyway that's a whole question of what we need to be doing but I think [noise] um\nYeah when we talk about the disconnect again Linda is an example of someone who is not disconnected 'cause it's right there right absolutely at her home level I Want to ask you about natural gas I'm Tom because that's really important here in New England is you know we rely heavily\nMany people say too heavily on natural gas and he went to New York and Pennsylvania um when did this region develop as a natural gas source just refresh\nI'm literally yeah I mean the Pennsylvania if I'm remembering correctly so quick dynamic in New York they had a moratorium and now in a in a central like a ban on natural gas fracking um and in Pennsylvania they embraced it essentially a sort of the political level and so in Pennsylvania\nAbout ... fourteen Fifteen Years ago two thousand five two thousand and six there was some sort of exploratory well drilling and particularly up in the northeast part of the state I walked from sort of near the town of Africa\nIn North to in a New York south across the border into such a county which had it was one of the most heavily\nDrilled a counties along it's it's a long walk it was Seventy mile law yeah so they in with your backpack with my backpack sleeping in a state forest a\nUm I I was I'm from Pittsburgh and I needed a place to stay one night and I passed the guy's house and he was wearing a Steelers hat and so I said hey Steelers you know next thing you know he's kind of leader you already are invited to his grown kids over for a barbecue that night so [noise]\nUm it was a yes but yeah it was a long walk but in ... county you know really over the last decade I'm In Pennsylvania and really recently and\nUh you certainly in the big sweep of time very recently but I'm a yeah I mean that that gas field went from an exploratory well well ... ... a little bit more than a decade ago to believe that President more well more than five thousand if not eight thousand well statewide\nSo what did the places in Pennsylvania that hosts fracking um look like\nThe towns nearby so totally different landscape to North Dakota North Dakota was the big wide open prairie or Pennsylvania if you've driven through it it's it's not dissimilar from New Hampshire for heavily wooded lots of ups and downs in the hills I never knew how many even though I'm from there until I Walk them\nUh but as one I actually had talked to a lawyer before I went down who was involved in sort of a representing people who didn't want fracking and he said it's very two dimensional you only see what I Would have been blocked and he was right you know I was walking down these roads cloaked in forest and\nLearn more Bedford team and dot com and from New Hampshire

P. R. dot org and Tom right back toward this just bill's calling from St them\nHad built you're on the air thanks for being with us [noise]\nChicken\n[laughter] hello to hear your voice that I had a house without wonderful woodstove and the and the natural gas water heater\n\nWhat a great idea [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nFeel good to hear from you absolutely I mean that is sort of the big takeaway for me is that we need to be and I am not a policy analyst at so I'm not going to say oh can we need to be doing X Y or Z but we need to be doing\nEverything we can to transition from fossil fuel store nobles\nAnd for example I Would just point to one [noise] the smarter people may have come up with the eye PCC report in two weeks ago pointed to the idea of what for lack of a better term is sort of a carbon tax write off putting a cost on the use of carbon forwarded by William North house and others who is a Nobel Prize winning economist\nI'm In the idea is that that ... and and this is being adopted ... different levels around the world I'm a by countries in in you by British Columbia different places\nAnd to some extent hearing in California um but but and there's a a ballot initiative in Washington state next week that a Washington state will vote on to sort of essentially\nA charge a producers of carbon based fuels right I'm a price to sell that because the west in the end end up in the right that'll get passed to us right and and what the what the point being that if we're ever going to kind of really um\nInvest in this transition we need to break the ... of the financial grip of the fossil fuel system\nAnd I don't mean that has any kind of radical overthrow thing I mean that as a sort of\nThat's the world in which we live in it is so powerful and it is such the status quo that unless we are willing to sort of de incentivized the use of that or incentivize the non use of it\nUm it too and then take some of that money and invest in whether it's wind or solar or geothermal or I'm a title or wherever you know the applications depending on where you are and what's going on\nIt's not going to happen there been some efforts in Texas is a place I went where there was some legislation and incentive is Asian and investment in wind and the wind it has the most industrial scale wind energy production in the nation and it's a really happy story Texas 'cause it's\nFascinating because when people think Texas they think oil but um you say no wind but I'm going to have an email here that kind of relates to what Bill is saying John sent us an email he says just finished reading the book\nWell written unique approach enjoyed it very much I'm John says in the world of energy followers we are divided into one of two camps do MERS or cornucopia ... ... look at our energy predicament include their conclude there is no way out and we are doomed\nCornucopia and see a vast array of energy alternatives we can turn to and carry on with little sacrifice or change\nCan't quite figure out where the author lands John says his book tries to leave us hopeful get their definite undercurrents of hopelessness and John says would like to hear his comments on this John well put a do murders or Conan cornucopia and um [noise] which one are you after reading\nYeah Thanks John first of all thanks for reading the book I appreciate um [noise]\nI mean so I I think I'm sort of in the middle looking at both sides as he describes it right I think the real estate in me having done this kind of reckoning of fossil fuels\nIs it sort of sees the sort of the scale of our dilemma right we consume so much energy as a nation still eighty percent of which is coming from fossil fuels\nThe international Energy Agency has done a did predict a sort of a forecast looking that by twenty fifty\nEnergy consumption will increase and the Porsche and we will be using to fuel that even though it may be a smaller percentage\nOn a raw level more oil gas and cold and we are today right so in less you know we just keep going seems amazing because we use so much right that's right so so that that part of me is is I wouldn't say that that doesn't make me feel doomed but I think it's important that we realize that that we as a society just sort of face the scale of what we consume\nAs a way of this is the information is not as power thing as a way of knowing the size of the problem because if we don't face it then we just think that nothing can be done or it'll be okay but the optimist and me the cornucopia ... is going to these places and specifically we're talking about Texas\nTexas has the most industrial scale wind energy development right in the state or in the in the in the United states\nAnd there was a night when I was there in March of twenty Seventeen I was walking through Carson county in the panhandle which is one\nHas had hundreds and hundreds of wind towers bill on these industrial scale wind farms is big business by the way for a hundred million dollars to build a wind farm with two hundred two megawatt turbans out to la turbans vilify nothing on that feeling like an author and he's like General Electric and Siemens financed by companies like city bank Morgan Stanley so you're starting to see\nSome of this economy shift right employing hundreds of people to build these things that really good rates so my point is like that's hopeful right maybe we can build an economy around this renewable energy but more to the point there was an evening where total energy consumption on the grid in Texas which is called are caught\nWas nearly fifty percent produced by wind to think about the Houston Dallas San Antonio Austin every little town in between every hospital every convenience store every home every air conditioning running nearly half\nOf the energy that was powering all of that was coming from wind power that's like that's not theoretical that's not cornucopia or the unicorn or whatever that is a real applied example and it's not perfect and there are people will say oh well you couldn't do that everywhere and they're right you know there are reasons where you can't do it everywhere but you can do it a lot of places so\nCould those Texans um you know harness all that wind power and put it on the grid for us here in New England\nOr over the papers you know ... so ... yes and no I mean there there could certainly be more wind and other parts of the country there's a lot of wind in the Appalachians in an offshore wind is booming earlier I was just talking to us a fellow who's involved in a huge offshore wind projects off the New Jersey and\nNew England and um but the other thing is that um\n[noise] yeah I mean transmission and storage or the two big kind of technical hurdles and again I'm not an engineer but I talked to a bunch\nOf 'em and you know we need better battery storage that's one of the big questions like great minds and our sort of racing toward how can we store so when it's really windy how can we store that so that three in the morning when it's not well actually it is when did three in the morning but it you know six in the morning when it's not\nI'm a ... we can feed the grid and similar with solar how can we basically store these renewable energy so that we can feed the grid at peak demand time and how can we also transfer it and so you know that does mean more power lines that means you know and we're talking about this alert unite that\nUm I I feel like you know we're beyond a the time of of perfect solution ...\nMean I think it's not ... yeah it's going to be a compromise because with wind here in New Hampshire any way um you know there are a lot of complaints\nUm the turbans they're big they're ugly they make noise that it just the complaints I'm not saying this is me talking I'm you know they hurt birds they hurt bats um you know we care a lot about bird migration in the states so um you had a lot of pushback against the wind here in New Hampshire I Wonder\nHow people in Texas that you talk to him and you walk through their backyards in their neighborhoods how did they feel about living side by side I'm In this giant it sounds giant I Can't even imagine how well it yeah again this is wide open prairie and picture sitting or if you've ever\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and

P. R. dot org\nAgain exchange at an H. P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter\nAnd HBO exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven and ...\n... what can the exchange going to feel good a sealer thanks for months at a time about this very ordinary event the guy comes over installs your water heater completely a normal thing that anyone might experience but it kind of made you go oh my gosh or a hot\nSo I mean the it happened obviously in a moment in that moment has you know for for years I had been reading headlines right about\nClimate change and global warming and this idea that we need to stop consuming so much and yet ah in two thousand Thirteen my wife and I were to younger children had bought a home in Durham New Hampshire a Nineteen sixty eight ranch and it needed some updating and as part of that some ... put it in a new natural gas furnace\nAnd so that's what we're doing and I was hanging out in the basement with Joel who was installing the furnace\nAnd he was saying this is going to be a you know efficient and it's going to be cheap because of a natural gas prices were low and it was all true and yet there was this kind of cognitive disconnect between this is the very thing that we're learning we're supposed to be doing less of right which is consuming fossil fuels\nAnd here I was paying thousands of dollars a to basically essentially connect myself more permanently to that system\nUm and the second piece of that was I'm from Pennsylvania originally and a Pennsylvania is one of the areas that has essentially been re defined by fracking hydraulic fracturing and this drilling which on the one hand has provided a lot more natural gas has\nBut at the same time uh has again committed us sort of deeper down a road of fossil fuel consumption and so I was standing in my basement wondering like what's going on out there I'm I'm a journalist by background and I had done a lot of that kind of field reporting\nAnd I thought you know that's something that I could maybe offer in this conversation about where we are is to go to the source um and so you know I sort of metaphorically\nAnd symbolically followed the pipe across the roof or the or across the feeling of the basement and out the door and thought you know I Want to go to sort of see what's happening in these places um where all of this has produced\nWell it's so easy to consume energy and here in New Hampshire we don't have a lot of home grown energy sources but if you travel anywhere you know California you see these\nGiant um wind farms on the brown hills I'm Out there traveled to other places Oklahoma you see this sort of you know rigs pumping up and down here in New England were kind of disconnected from where our energy comes from\nAbsolutely and so in a sense I mean that was that was at the heart of what I was feeling was almost is over installation right I mean we live in this modern era and I'm thankful for modern medicine I drove over here in a car that all I had to do I could hold my coffee and my hand and push a little gas pedal and I I traverse the state right where the Jersey it'll effort [noise]\nUm but as you point out you know we don't often see the transaction of that where things come from\nUm obviously in an earlier era of people were chopping wood or you know out there a kind of getting their own fuel and in many parts of the world today still but in working hard to get that working hard to get there was a sort of an involvement in the transaction right between sort of what you needed to survive and how you were living\nAnd now because of modern technology because of this industrial where we live in you know we're just we're insulated within that we don't see it and even\nMore conceptually many of us or if you work in an office in your paycheck goes direct deposit to your bank account and if you have payment for your electric bill set up ... you don't even know how much you've consumed how much you've paid you've never seen the money you've earned you've never seen that go out to pay\nSo again a lot of convenience in some ways in those systems but the net result is\nThat we're we're over instantly like who you just don't feel that that sense in at a time sort of as a society I think when we need to be more aware of that\nWell why does closing that disconnect or opening up that uh insulation I think as you put it Tom why does that matter some of these energy landscapes are quite an attractive and even unhealthy\nYeah I think that I mean you know for for a while we were able to maybe not let it matter as a society when we didn't know the costs right but we've learned I think at the heart of the\nKind of climate change conundrum is that uh we've learned that we need to be more aware of what we're consuming and how and by the way I mean whether it's carbon based or not I mean how much and so I think I just felt you know I think that collectively or we need to be more aware that so that we can follow certain policy pads\nBut also just individually I don't know about you I I teach at UNH I was talking to a group of college students about this but there's a certain uh helplessness to this ... this insulation when we you know you read the headline it almost doesn't matter you know two weeks ago\nThe UN or international panel on climate change came out and said well this is happening faster than we thought it's going to be worse than we thought\nWere going to be seeing some really significant impacts by twenty forty and I looked around the room a college students how would you guys being twenty forty and they were like thirty eight now during how I write so we're not talking just you know grandkids grandkids are we're talking now essentially\nAnd so I kind of felt I'm just on a personal level kind of helpless you know in the basement they're like wow I'm I'm paying you know lots of money for this I don't know how this all works\nUm and so for me as just a writer and in in this journey I mean I think what I was trying to do was almost to kind of you know information is power\nRight is it was the kind of try to understand it and feel a little less helpless well\nIs information power because um you're right it's\nOh dire um is it power or is it power less ness to understand what's going on\nA little bit of both I mean I have to admit I mean we can talk about the journey is in a second but I'm you know being out there you know I sort of went to these fossil fuel landscapes first and it became a sort of a reckoning of of\nHow much we consume and I tell you I was on an oil rig and just seeing what is done on one rig or in one little corner of the United states which was one little corner of the world in terms of global oil production\nI'm On an afternoon I was there a Memorial Day twenty two thousand fourteen\nUm to just to fill gas tanks for that moment um\nYou know what I guess what it gave me though was a sort of an appreciation and a sense of what we need to overcome which in a way increased in my mind sort of the urgency of the situation um\nBecause it is that the amazing thing of living inside a our world of you know sort of on the receiving end of the fuel is it's pretty calm world you know you kind of these these problems seem theoretical and when\nI was in the bucket oil field in North Dakota for example and thousands of people are drilling hundreds of rigs or you know for for oil which has increased by fifty percent us oil production that in ... in other places\nAnd again the you know in the short term has some potentially positive impacts people will say hey it's cheaper fuel energy independence et cetera\nBut you sit there and you and you kind of feel on an organic level that we're digging deeper at a time and we shouldn't be so I Do want to get in yeah yeah different landscapes\nThat you walk through and that's great and I want to let listeners fields of fracking natural gas\nSolar wind Tom kind of explored it all on foot and we'll hear about that in well I also want to remind you that you can join us our number here in exchange one eight hundred\nEight nine to fix for sat on fat and send us an email exchange it an H. P. R. dot org we're talking about a new book that explores this disconnect that Tom Haynes talks about\nBetween the extreme eve most of us have with energy consumption and the real difficulty and challenges and\nCost of energy energy production\nJoined us with your thoughts email exchange and H. P. R. dot org or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven one more thing before we get into some of the places that you walk through um Tom the title of the book walking to the sun now you remind us in the book that all energy really does start with the sun not just the obvious\nSo learn a lot of people kind of probably remember you know science in school how fossil fuels are created I'm\nAlso by the sun but just to remind us get us kind of a science one oh one about how all types of energy that we consume here on earth start with the sun you know fossil fuels wind titled fuel everything a lot of folks will know this but some folks might not\nWe'll stand well gas and coal which are the three predominant fossil fuels and again I'm I'm not a scientist but as a as a journalist have sort of looked at this question a lot you know oil or gas and coal which are the three fossil fuels we're\nYou know basically created from plant life or that was generated by the energy of the sun right dinosaurs yeah and and you know kind of exactly did that sort of pressed underground and in that case I'll just give one example we won't go there yet but of\nBubble tonight nor the New Hampshire has a chance of rain showers low temperatures over thirty to lower forties\nIt'll be cloudy tomorrow some rain likely temperatures upper forties to the mid fifties\nThis is an HBO\nThis is the exchange I'm Laura ... today walking to the sun a new book by UNH author on his pilgrimage through America's energy consumption landscape spoke traditional fossil fuels and renewables\nIt was a journey he says aimed at closing the gap between the ease of energy consumption and the difficulty of energy production let's hear from you send email to exchange it N. H. P. R. dot org\nAgain exchange it any P. R. dot org was found on Facebook or Twitter at an HBO exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to fix for seven seven and a time just before the break um we were talking about a year trip here first let's get that you walk through the oil fields of North Dakota\nAnd I was asking you about how the people there felt about the changes in their lives from this you know sudden rush up oil production and you said there were definitely negatives but also a lot of positives\nI mean first of all just kind of set the scene so this area of North Dakota is wide open right I'm rugged land\nI'm sort of the classic windswept prairie right and I'm over the last century there had been sort of a boom of family farming from the early Nineteen hundreds and there were communities sprung up I Walk to a place called Charleston North Dakota and McKenzie counting that had been home to more than three hundred people in the Nineteen forties and fifties\nUm but since then I just happened to much of America particularly in the big sort of a western reaches a it was hard to keep the family farm farming got more industrialized and so in Charles so now they're for families effectively farming the same amount of land\nUm so you know a lot of my point is that this is these are communities out of which a lot of people have moved a lot of young people have gone off to release you know ... a lot of area a lot of areas and if you've ever seen one of those National Geographic issues of of North Dakota you know the sort of the sideways leaning barn with the roof started ... you know a lot of that right\nI'm at the same time a lot of big industrial scale farming going on soybeans or spring wheat or whatever but\nIt was into that that sort of a terrain that they will boom came right and so um you had\nJust depended on who you talk to but there were some ranchers who um it's a place that has a tradition of kind of that land as a resource rates oils and resource so yes if someone came in and wrote on their land there was a psychology of like that's what we're supposed to be doing\nA it gives us you know money my kids can stay around um but again as I was explaining to without getting too far North Dakota law there's mineral rights in some farmers didn't even own the mineral rights their land so these are not a sort of subtle thing as you were talking two hundred and fifty foot a high a drilling rig coming in\nDrilling two miles down two miles over and leaving an operating well sometimes within if I'm remembering correctly I think they can drill within two hundred and fifty feet or five hundred feet of a farmhouse\nSo there are as you know some people who\nWere used to the high lonely planes and their way of life to all of a sudden had an industrial zone right around the house well it's\nThat it's that the un you talked about that disconnect between energy consumption and energy production um and how most of us especially here in New England don't really see that but if you're in North Dakota farmer and all of a sudden there's an oil rig in visual backyard you're not disconnected anymore it right there\nYou're not just going to even though that oil might be going off to a to a processing plant in Texas right but you were\nYou ... you were basically all of a sudden in the backyard of American energy industry right and so the other interesting thing about North Dakota is North Dakota farmers need water and they have a great appreciation for the table water and the water that as a ... also as a resource and clean water specifically\nSo there there was a lot more awareness and uncertainty of people I talked to a while this is great but boy we're pumping millions of gallons of water into these wells to frack some with chemicals\nAnd we're not sure what's going on there I talked to one rancher Donny Nelson who's you know third generation both grandparents kinda homesteaded et cetera um who just said look you're talking about human beings and machines and things will go wrong you know and so there was a\nI think on a kind of you know organic level of nervousness there among some people that um you know this is all this land is all we got right and they were ripping it up a literally to to get the oil out um you know they will be the ones who pay for that\nIt's going to our listeners and then I Want to talk about these other landscapes that you walk through although I'm really intrigued by some of these stories about North Dakota I've got a lot more about that but other landscapes that Tom Haynes walk through include um natural gas in Pennsylvania and New York where the sensibility about natural gas is different\nAlso hole in Wyoming Southern California so we're talking about all that and you can join us to one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven send us an email exchange at an H. P. R. dot org I'm Tom Linda's on the line from Durham your hometown Hi Linda go ahead you're on the air welcome\nThe morning and thanks for taking my call sure I just wanted to point out one thing that we haven't yeah I'm not talking about as a as a local source of energy which is geothermal uh I think most people don't realize that I'm\nJust five state down into the earth the earth is fifty five degrees\nAnd geothermal heating systems are able to capture that he puts a lot of that energy it worked terrific and or in the northeast uh and I energy up their mall a system put in when I bought my house of about four years ago\nA and it's been kicking the coast ever sense why it replaced propane furnace\nUm and it's harvesting heat and it can either be if you have some open land you could just take a five foot deep trench or if you just have a small lot you can I have a well driller a drill a hole to put the piping down into the ground to harvest that he\nUh you do have a little more electricity to run the heat pumps that concentrates the heat and bring it up a buck fifty thought job where I'm your house um but\nTo do that and now I basically not burning ... killed my home and it is called New England winter\nAnd you are definitely not disconnected from your energy sources there Linda it's All right there in her home did you feel thermal there isn't really a geothermal landscape that you can walk through right I\nI didn't look into geothermal but first of all I think you know when does absolutely right and I think um you know that's awesome to be using that resource and I think that's a kind of thing we need to be doing is sort of exploring both local and industrial scale stuff or whether it's backyard energy out of something like geothermal\nUm and the reason why I didn't was I was primarily concerned that sort of just ... as sort of uh uh the yang to the you know fossil fuels to going to these\nI'm looking at sources that could kind of on an industrial level feed the grid and geothermal ... absolutely can't to um it was just I had to stop somewhere but I Do think to to Linda's point um it's important that places where we can be pushing the boundaries of both\nUm both the technology that's being used but also kind of the um the affordability of it the more people who are using geothermal in their homes that creates a market for it these companies will go after it [noise]\nUm anyway that's a whole question of what we need to be doing but I think [noise] um yeah\nWhen we talk about the disconnect again Linda is an example of someone who is not disconnected because it's right there right at ... at her home level I Want to ask you about natural gas I'm Tom because that's really important here in New England is you know we rely heavily\nMany people say too heavily on natural gas and he went to New York and Pennsylvania um we did this region develop as a natural gas source just refreshing\nLiterally yeah I mean the Pennsylvania if I'm remembering correctly so quick dynamic in New York they had a moratorium an hour to an essential like a ban on natural gas fracking um and in Pennsylvania they embraced it essentially a sort of the political level and so in Pennsylvania\nAbout for a fourteen Fifteen Years ago two thousand five two thousand and six there was some sort of exploratory well drilling and particularly up in the northeast part of the state I walked from sort of near the town of Africa\nIn North in New York south across the border into ... county which had it was one of the most heavily\nDrilled a counties along it's it's a long walk it was Seventy mile ... yeah so they end with your backpack with my backpack sleeping in a state forest a\nUm I I was I'm from Pittsburgh and I needed a place to stay one night and I passed the guy's house and he was wearing a Steelers hat and so I said hey Steelers you know next thing you know he's ... yeah you're already a invited his grown kids over for a barbecue that night so [noise]\nUm it was a yes but yeah it was a long walk but in ... county you know really over the last decade I'm In Pennsylvania we haven't really recently and uh you certainly in the big sweep of time very recently but um [noise]\nUh yeah I mean that that gas field went from an exploratory well well ... ... a little bit more than a decade ago to believe that President ... more well more than five thousand if not eight thousand well statewide\nSo what did the places in Pennsylvania that hosts fracking um look like I'm Wondering about the actual facility Tom but also the towns nearby\nSo totally different landscape to North Dakota North Dakota was the big wide open prairie or Pennsylvania if you've driven through it it's it's not dissimilar from New Hampshire for heavily wooded lots of ups and downs in the hills I never knew how many even though I'm from there until I Walk them\nUh but as one I actually had talked to a lawyer before I went down who was involved in sort of a representing people who didn't want fracking and he said it's very two dimensional you only see what ... what is it blocked and he was right you know I was walking down these roads cloaked in forest and\nBody for tonight nor the New Hampshire has a chance of rain showers low temperatures over thirty used a lower\nForties cloudy rain likely tomorrow temperatures over forty to fifty [noise]\nThis was on HBO\nThis is the exchange I'm Mark annoy tomorrow in our show our civics one oh one team explains how midterms work and why they're so important that's tomorrow on the exchange this hour pilgrimage across America's energy production landscapes with you and they just do the professor and author Tom Haynes his new book is called walking to the sun joined us\nOne eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven send us an email exchange it and H. P. R. dot org and Tom right back to our listeners bill's calling from Saddam had built you're on the air thanks for being with us [noise]\n\nChicken\n[laughter] hello to hear your voice that I had a house without wonderful woodstove and the and the natural gas Watergate or\nWhat a great I\nThink what we\nTalk about my answer off the\nGood to hear from you absolutely I mean that is sort of the big takeaway for me is that we need to be and I I'm not a policy analyst so I'm not going to say okay we need to be doing X Y or Z but we need to be doing everything we can\nFor example I'll just point to one [noise] that smarter people to me it's come up with the PCC report two weeks ago pointed to the idea of what for lack of better term is sort of a carbon tax write off putting a cost on the use of carbon um forwarded by William North house and others who is a Nobel Prize winning economist\nI'm In the idea is that that ... and and this is being adopted ... different levels around the world I'm a by countries in in you by British Columbia different places\nAnd to some extent hearing in California um but but and there's a a ballot initiative in Washington state next week that are washing staters will vote on to sort of essentially\nA charge a producers of carbon based fuels right I'm a price to sell that because this was in the end end up in the right that'll get passed to us right\nAnd and but the but the point being that if we're ever going to kind of really um invest in this transition we need to break the inertia of the financial grip the fossil fuel system and I don't mean that it's any kind of radical overthrow thing I mean that as a sort of\nThat's the world in which we live in it is so powerful and it is such the status quo that unless we are willing to sort of de incentivize the use of that or incentivize the non use of it\nUm to and then take some of that money and invest in whether it's wind or solar or geothermal or I'm a title or wherever you know the applications depending on where you are and what's going on\nIt's not going to happen there been some efforts in Texas is a place I went where there was some legislation an incentive is Asian and investment in wind and the wind it has the most industrial scale wind energy production in the nation and it's a really happy story really want to have your taxes because it's\nFascinating because when people think Texas they think oil but um you say no wind but I'm kind of an email here that kind of relates to what Bill is thing John sent us an email he says just finished reading the book\nWell written unique approach enjoyed it very much I'm John says in the world of energy followers we are divided into one of two camps do MERS or cornucopia eons ... look at our energy predicament include their conclude there is no way out and we are doomed\nCornucopia and see a vast array of energy alternatives we can turn to and carry on with little sacrifice or change\nCan't quite figure out where the author inland John says his book tries to leave us hopeful get their definite undercurrents of hopelessness and John says would like to hear his comments on this John well put a do murders or Conan cornucopia and um [noise] which one are you after writing\nYeah Thanks John first of all thanks for reading the book I appreciate um [noise]\nI mean so I I think I'm sort of in the middle looking at both sides as he describes it right I think the real estate in me having done this kind of reckoning on fossil fuels\nIs it sort of sees the sort of the scale of our dilemma right we consume so much energy as a nation still eighty percent of which is coming from fossil fuels\nThe international Energy Agency has done did predict a sort of a forecast looking that by twenty fifty\nA global energy production or energy consumption will increase\nAnd the Porsche and we will be using to fuel that even though it may be a smaller percentage\nOn a raw level more oil gas and cold and we are today right so in less you know we just keep going seems amazing because we use so much right that's right so so that that part of me is is I wouldn't say that that doesn't make me feel doomed but I think it's important that we realize that that we as a society just sort of face the scale of what we consume\nAs a way of this is the information is not as power thing as a way of knowing the size of the problem because if we don't face it then we just think nothing can be done or it'll be okay but the optimist and me the cornucopia ... is going to these places and specifically we're talking about Texas Texas has the most industrial sites\nSupport for any ... live stream comes from you our listeners and from Congress regional visiting nurse association\nA home health in hospice agency serving people of all ages and more than forty one communities discover how the conquered regional DNA can help you remain independent in your home and live life to the fullest\nDid it the RV an A. dot org\n... bank Morgan Stanley so you're starting to see some of this economy shift right employing hundreds of people to build these things that really good rates so my point is like that's hopeful right maybe we can build an economy around this renewable energy but more to the point there was an evening where total energy consumption on the grid in Texas which is called are caught\nWas nearly fifty percent produced by wind to think about the Houston Dallas San Antonio Austin every little town in between every hospital every convenience store every home every air conditioning running nearly half\nOf the energy that was powering all of that was coming from wind power that's like that's not theoretical that's not cornucopia or the unicorn or whatever that is a real applied example and it's not perfect and there are people will say oh well you couldn't do that everywhere and they're right you know there are reasons where you can't do it everywhere but you can do it a lot of places so\nCould those Texans um you know harness all that wind power and put it on the grid for us here in New England or over the past with ...\nSo ... yes and no I mean there there could certainly be more wind and other parts of the country there's a lot of wind in the Appalachians in an offshore wind is booming earlier I was just talking to us a fellow who's involved in a huge offshore wind projects off the New Jersey and New England and um but the other thing is that um\n[noise] yeah I mean transmission and storage or the two big kind of technical hurdles and again I'm not an engineer but I talked to a bunch\nOf 'em and you know we need better batteries storage that's one of the big questions like great minds and our sort of racing toward how can we store so when it's really windy how can we store that so that three in the morning when it's not well actually it is when did three in the morning but it you know six in the morning when it's not\nI'm a ... we can feed the grid and similar with solar how can we basically store these renewable energy so that we can feed the grid at peak demand time and how can we also transfer it and so you know that does mean more power lines that means you know and we're talking about this alert you know that\nUm I I feel like you know we're beyond a the time of of perfect solution ...\nI mean I think it's not ... yeah it's going to be a compromise because with wind here in New Hampshire any way um you know there are a lot of complaints\nUm the turbans they're big they're ugly they make noise that it just the complaints I'm not saying this is me talking I'm you know they hurt birds they hurt bats um you know we care a lot about bird migration in the states so um you had a lot of pushback against the wind here in New Hampshire I Wonder\nHow people in Texas that you talk to him and you walk through their backyards in their neighborhoods how did they feel about living side by side I'm In this giant it sounds giant I Can't even imagine how well it\nAgain this is wide open prairie and picture sitting or if you've ever many people in your head for probably looked out at the ... off the coast that the ocean at night and you've seen a a a buy a boat brewing a bobbing it it's a buoy with a light on or something and\nPicture thousands of those out on the prairie or the night when I was camps you would look and you would see thousands of these blinking red lights it looks like a C and those were when towers\nUm and again they're mixed there are some people I've talked to a farmer who stopped they pulled up in his truck because I was walking and he said what are you doing I'm as I'm writing about wind energy these damn towers you know it's really ruin the place right he remembers being a kid running around and he said you know the highest thing anywhere was offensive post\nUm that being said uh we need to kind of a right we need to figure out what choices are we going to make and so that was in his case was an unseen fuel power\nI'd be allowed him to have this beautiful prairie was essentially we've known for decades now um you know admitting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ... a ... you know the leading cause of global warming and now we're learning all these different or whatnot we're learning we've we know about um you know increased intensity of storms or", "show_name": "The
