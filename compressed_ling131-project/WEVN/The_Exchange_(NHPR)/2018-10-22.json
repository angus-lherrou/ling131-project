B. R. dot org again exchange it any P. R. dot org respond on Facebook or Twitter at any PR exchange or give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven\nWe have two guests in Studio ... peak in this here UNH professor of wildlife ecology former chair of the department of natural resources and Pete is one of the co authors of this recently published study of moves in northern New England\nThat I mentioned and the effect of winter tax on the moose I'm Pete it's really nice to see a welcome back when I used to be back or also with us ... Iran deer project leader for New Hampshire fish and game he did his master's degree where with professor ... studying moose and winter take and Dan welcome good to see you too thank you thanks for having me\nSo Peter twenty first you've been studying news for a bunch of years now what jumps out at you from this latest research that just came out this year\nWell you know the\nMost surprising result is that the high frequency of these what we call winter ticket ... with very high cap mortality and spring\nIt's really unprecedented in North America ... what's that so we defined that by over fifty percent of cabs dying a in late winter early spring and that's\nCat's dying doesn't sound good for the future of this most population\nWhat's really crazy is this is in some of the best most habitat imaginable give us a little more than ... oh how great as it for yeah so a great should it be for those yeah many people aren't aware of that a New England northern New England has actually moved central in the lower forty eight states there are more and most in this region than anywhere else\nIn the country bar Alaska\nAnd um our problems can specifically relate to that we're at the southern ranging moves and that's really part of this issue and why we you know have a climate changes is part of the discussion and how that impacts both most and most importantly tick density\nCell again I'm this research among researchers in three states has been ongoing for a number of years now four or five years at least but the thing that jumps out at you from this most recent data Pete is the cat is a really just not making\nYes four or five years we've had these conditions and again that's that's unprecedented in history [noise]\nWhat do you think Dan you've been working on this for a while to\nYeah I'd agree with that these these high mortality rates that we've been seeing in most cabs over the years is is is astounding um I Know some some of the first research that we did was loose in the state you know we we had one year where we had about fifty percent mortality and that stood out\nUm and and it's just been consistent year after year um what what seemed like an outlier has become the norm\nAnd I've read I think in your research that Seventy percent now mortality for cats is that right Pete that was the latest\nThat number the average of for the five years or five years or completed a we we still are tracking those currently radio collared most um we had one year over ... and interestingly that year we had the September drought people might remember in two thousand Seventeen\nUh chicks are are highly susceptible to Des occasion and very dry windy conditions and that was the month of September of that year and then winter came by mid November and that's really key in this story and the winters start later and later or autumn czar extended\nUh in the last decade or so and uh I mean really noticeably so this place to the advantage of the tick so we\nLike a dry weather [laughter] when it comes to getting rid of that takes the death of meeting the moose and we like an early frost and early winter\nYeah I'm I'm not advocating for drought yeah its benefits and its drawbacks right um but certainly we like to believe that we could have a normal winter in New England but the real question is what is normal today\nSo I Want to get into the ticks and how they you know I'm\nI really harming them loose and so forth but just before we do that guys how do you gauge the moose population decline um this headline of\nYou know a dramatic decline in moose populations because depending on when you start counting they're eating more moves or fewer most in New Hampshire today and Dana twenty first for example from fishing game\nUm fish and game says the moose population was only fifty animals in Nineteen fifty grew to sixteen hundred by the late eighties Nineteen eighty eight then they move population peaked in the Nineteen nineties between seven thousand in Seventy five hundred moves so let me talk about decline how should we really look at this\nYeah so when typically when we're talking about declined we're talking about the client from when the when we kind of reintroduce the hunter the state in the eighties\nUm that's when we started getting more data on what the most population was there was a study that was done I'm doing some aerial survey work um that we we've been correlated with the hunter Hobbs\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think this at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here in the\nEarly nineties I mean we hear about this with deer for example when there's too many dear you know there's not enough food and they all get sick and um and that's not good either\nYeah so that that could that\nThat's part of the story I think um you know we did have a really really low population um and typically when you have populations that are low you have lots of resources of the moose population was able to explode because of that\nAnd in the northern part of the state there was some evidence that maybe we over shot what we should have had on the landscape um but but all the research we've conducted since then suggests that habitat quality is is not the big issue here\nSo again it's Pete said habitat is great for most of the winner takes and the warmer winters that encourage their growth can jump in on that to Pete um the idea that some biologist they're talking about that I'm part of this decline has because there was an unhealthy levels of movies and you know a decade or so\nUm well I I think as Dan said we shouldn't expect to maintain a population at the highest level we've ever measured it I mean there's tremendous six expansion and population growth naturally that will pull itself back\nUm you know as an example some of these moose dispersed in Connecticut or the\nDense population density and the Berkshires of Massachusetts was quite high for a while\nWhich I which is far south and that's right that's not moves habitat but that just showed how expansive an explosive population response was to a tremendous forest harvesting levels in the Nineteen eighties um so it had to come back and that's part of this decline\nBut when you lose so many cabs in so many years\nAnd the other factor that we've measured and identified as the productivity of adults has declined and when you combine these two things that will drive that population down slowly\nSo female moose might have had two cats um at one time and now they're that almost never happens\nYeah I think the uh the best example of this impact is that year ling moves so this would be the second fall for female about thirty percent of those animals were reproducing one calf\nBack in the early to thousands literally no your lungs breed today young female that's rare just two week\nThey're too small I wouldn't you know there there's kind of a whole continuum of health at an animal so you know a really robust\nYelling cow should breed the you know up to thirty to fifty percent of those but we're at about zero we're at zero percent today essentially we've had no year link cows reproduce in this study in five\nYears and then your interview with any parents any real Pete Pete I think you said that um it was not uncommon for a female most to have twins you know a decade ago and now that I almost never happens\nYes we I think a mid to thousands we had about thirty percent of our adult cows winning and we had a big party when we had one couch twin two years ago yeah\nLot more questions for you guys have someone remind our listeners though that you can join us we'd love to hear from you your questions comments your own observations about northern New England

UNH professor of wildlife ecology one of the co authors of a recently published study of moose in northern New England and the effect of winter ticks also with us Denver John Deere project leader for New Hampshire fish and game he did his master's degree work with professor ...\nStudying moose and winter take one more time our number one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven one\nEight hundred eight nine ... and H PR and gentlemen lots more commentary from our listeners but he didn't want to just sheer you reiterate again because I think that's an important point it's not so much the severity of the winter that will determine\nHow well the most do it's how early winter begins so just make that point again in and remind us why that's important\nYeah so I'm a calf will die from winter ticks based on the ticket load on the calf that's the direct correlation because it's just\nIn late march and April so part in part the tick load on that cap is simply a function of how\nActive ticks are during autumn and how long autumn is so it's just the game of time really\nIn a two to three week period that delays the start of winter amounts to forty to fifty percent of the entire time normally that these ticks would be costing for hosts which is the term for when they're seeking to get on and moves\nUh so it's it's this is why the start of winter is so critical in in this story and we've lost the same ...\nSenate cabs being an easy winner or where the most severe winter you know in in the last decade\nSo how we judge a winter I mean we've had winters that started late that play once they started it was freezing cold and it was piles of snow and you're saying that doesn't matter it's when it starts\nRight because once they get on that animal they're they're pretty secure um\nThey're happy and one for the yeah it doesn't matter what the temperature is outside that's right wow that's really interesting because again from a human perspective a couple of weeks you know doesn't seem to matter that much but for the moves that matters a lot it's that's the game that's going on out there then you wouldn't jump in\nYeah in moose or those were designed to to handle severe winters there they are much different than here in that regard [noise]\nUm so severe winters don't necessarily impact motion and these ticks will they kind of go through a dorm and see period after they get on um they'll go through a few different life stages but the bulk of the blood loss takes place of the when they when they built into adults and that's in the spring\nSo again the severity of the winter um does not impact them as much as as when winter starts um how many ticks they're going to get on them um and then it's it's in the springtime after the winter's over where you're going to be seeing the impacts\nAnd again the reason that the big concern from this most recent research Dan is that cat is they're really just not making it Seventy percent I think you guys said at the beginning of show which is devastating so all those tax on a young most is even tougher for them to to make it through right\nYes ... cabs typically will get about the same number of of total ticks on them as as adult most but because of that smaller body size they just can't handle that those massive loads\n'em and they're they're just losing too much blood over a short period of time for their body to be able to replace that and that's during a time of year when they're already energetically stressed and there's there's really no good food out there for them yet in the spring\nOr in the northern part of the state typically green up hasn't happened so there's not a lot of\nThere's not a lot of food and them out in the woods for them to find to to help replace all that blood is getting lost\nUm Pete in an interview with them again in each period Annie Ropeik and thank you any of that interview was really helpful to me for preparing for this show you said that winter takes our host specific they prefer moose dear why did win a ticks prefer most dear [noise]\nWell maybe I misspoke no [laughter] I'm they're going to say they're going to latch onto what walks by here in New Hampshire there are a lot of deer their primary differences that deer and most are very different and how they clean themselves or\nWeek deer or social groomers if you watched deer they're always grooming all day long and they groom each other oh that's interesting is actually ... yeah and a deer can reach any part of his body whether it's ... physically moose can't even\nThat and the thought is that because they really are a much a ... a more northern mammal where activists parasites or less common that they simply didn't evolve with these grooming strategies insults\nTicks are on the animal until that irritation level is so high when the ... state just feeding in January and February we don't see any impact on the animal they ... they don't respond to it basically so you know essentially the game is over for them\nAt that point because they can effectively removed these parasites anyway\nThat's interesting echo parasite by the way the parasite with that exoskeleton\nOr on the outside outside okay not inside your your guy or whatever horses that and the parents of okay All right I was close but not really [laughter] you know as I think I think you've passed [laughter]\nThan um you've studied deer endless anyone who your thoughts are there that um these when it takes seem to prefer maybe they don't prefer most over dear dear just do a better job of getting rid of them that's really interesting\nYeah and that's that's certainly what the research has shown and again it's another one of those kind of perfect storm scenarios here or mousse or a naive posted this um the thought is is that this parasite did evolve with deer deer and more effective\nUm the peak of chicken activity when they're questioning are searching for a host is is right in the middle of when the peak breeding activity for most is um so those animals are moving around on the landscape more which gives them more opportunity to pick these things up\nUm they've done studies on the heights of of the vegetation where these ticks will climbed quest um and the the kind of average height that they quest on vegetation is right at chess tired of all most of the perfect height for these\nMoves to be picking them up as they're walking around so [noise]\nUm it's not necessarily that they prefer most it's just that all these factors are kind of stacked against most um 'cause they'll they'll attach to anything that brushes up against them it's just other things are either more effective at grooming or aren't as active during that time of year yeah and I did not know the deer were\nSort of social rumors is that what you said the yeah yeah I'm ... and the the other odd thing about this tick is that when we think about black legged tick sort of deer ticks and lime disease I mean we've all picked up a tick\nBut when these larval ticks are questioning they aren't pods of hundreds yeah I've heard you say that they are all linked together and so when that most brush brushes up against that this is how these animals can have loads\nOn average we've measured fifty thousand ticks but we've had single cast with a hundred thousand six\nAnd when I run a physiological model at the you know what's the impact of that blood loss\nAh it's it's a cute anemia and death you just cannot that these animals cannot deal with that\nThe adult the animals are have enough body mass to deal with it but this is why there's an impact on productivity why reproductive rates are lower in a lack of winning and in adult most um\nI think the the piece of data that bothers me the most is what we call the successive breathing rate and normally we'd expect Seventy to eighty percent of adult cows to have a calf every year and that number is fluctuating between twenty five and forty percent and the current study\nOh my gosh again because the females just aren't big enough they pay a price to pull a calf off and they they they need an extra year to recover wow Dan\nYan ... you know Peter mentioned the drought that we saw a couple of years ago and and again this is just more evidence pointing to the impact that these ticks are having\n'em when we did have that drought and and most did seem to get one year reprieve from from this problem um you know we did start to see pretty rapidly increases in productivity and success and pointing rates are their success of reproductive rates in twenty eight so those things even just with one year did did rebound to some extent\nMultiple years of that we might get that that used to be the opposite where we'd have one outbreak of tax and then they'd have chance to recover and now it's now which we might get one year where they get a break from it\nAll right let's go back to our listeners gentlemen lots more to talk about again our number one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven to an exchange northern New England moose what we know now about their plight and as we're hearing researchers in New Hampshire and Maine and Vermont had been working on an extensive multi year study on these mammals\nFrom good news garage in New England ... donation nonprofit accepting repairing

P. R. dot org Facebook or Twitter is any PR exchange and our phone number is one eight hundred\nEight nine to fix for seven seven and a peak peak in Stanford drowned let's go right back to our listeners lots of people jumping in with their questions observations\nConcerns guilt calling in from New Boston Hi Gail go ahead you're on the air\nGood morning morning I'm yet the confrontation hold off a luncheon that uh the impact of the start of winter and I'm Wondering how you define that\nFairly December twenty first all the time how do we know that there has been done\nYeah Gayle good question and sometimes it seems like it's been done and then it stops so that's another factor thank you so much for the question go go ahead be\nA ... we should refer to Dan here because it was his research that that actually identified a the conditions that ticks are basically and they're questioning sure go ahead Dan\nYan ... started winters all relative on on what you're what you're looking at the start of winter for kicks um is really when we first get some extensive snowfall that's going to stay on the ground I'm just a frost isn't enough to do it are these ticks you're pretty hearty\nWe actually when we were when we were collecting these out in the field um we would drag white pieces of lay all over the vegetation and and we storm in a freezer\n'em and count 'em at a later date and we would take these flannels out of the freezer and when they would warm up the ticks would start moving again\nOh my so so they can be frozen for a while yeah if if they're even even just extreme cold for a short period of time doesn't quite do it you really need that you really need that snow on the ground um that sticks around for a while in order to stop the questioning and kill these animals be killed these ticks\nSo that's interesting because sometimes you know it does seem like a winter is here and then it warms up again and so you're saying that early start isn't enough it needs to be early and sustained and is that\nWhat you're saying early and sustained for at least several days of of snow on the ground a frost won't do it a a quick snow that comes and goes won't do it it has to be extended snow\nWell it's interesting it's a great question Gayle thank you go ahead please\nSo ah yeah dance research we're actually repeating a little bit with the little um\nSidelines to this fall so I have people who are dragging for ticks everyday up north\nYeah again where you were the question is what is pick up on the inside the landscape and what influences that\nAnd just last week the graduate student is directing that project came in and go you know they really drop this week we're not picking up any I think that few cold days last weekend or whenever it was his knock them back and I sat there and smile that amount I go you could be so lucky ... and yesterday I got the email that\nOh my God there's thousands on the sheet today so it's a way Dan described\nReally so and knocks him back and make some quiet for a few days but unless it's sustained for a week or so and they're going to come back\nYet I mean we don't you know we don't have the exact lengths of time but but typically I think a week of a week of snow on the ground would be enough to probably stop questioning um and like you said it's the the short cold snaps will will certainly make them inactive but it won't kill them\nAll right well let's take another call thank you for that question gal I say is calling from Brookfield Hi Phil you're on the air welcome\n[noise] yes I was curious to know um ... if any a predator or\nSomething that stays up birds or sex or anything like it's probably that's probably an obvious answer to that they're out of control but I was just curious if there's anything that each some\nWell see I Love the question because you know almost everybody has just concerned about the moose and we all want to not see those pictures of ghost moose I'm struggling and hear about these dying cash so thank you say go ahead Dan\nYeah there are there are a number of things that will eat them and they actually did some research in Canada looking at this there's Mac pies and gray jays and and uh things like that in Canada that they noticed will will actually land on motion pick some of these ticks off and feed on them um there's nothing that feeds on them to the extent that would knock their their populations\nSo what about something that would feed on them before they get on I mean you talked about how in the summertime that that was fine because\nHanging out in the tall grasses um so\nYeah the the problem is is that most of the periods when these texture and active so you know in the in the springtime the adults drop off they lay eggs um\nAnd and when the larvae hatch out later in the summer um you know that they're they're under the leaf litter I'm so there's we really don't have any you know they're not just sitting out there on the vegetation lie for them to come along and eat them the only time that's happening is in the fall and again there's there's nothing out there that he'd sent enough of them where it would be able to reduce the population\nBecause of their life cycle and how they form um as you explained earlier ... there's just so many of them\nYeah and then could explain a kind of a funny story I mean it is hard to imagine how tiny a single ... is that we're talking about this time of year of course if you put a few hundred of them together they're visible but\nWhen they ended his research we had a whole bunch of people in the room and we're all going to count and I did a sheet and said it's clean and\nDid another sheet inside is clean and then Dan walked over and said did you do that sheet and I said yes and he goes well there's eight right there so you know that's how small they are my eyes weren't good enough to see him so they remove me from that process which was pretty funny\nWell actually I'm pushing the question said because we did a show earlier this year as we do practically every spring about Lyme disease and the black lagoon takes a carry Lyme disease and we learned on that show Dana turn this to you on that ... who actually really good\nUm kicked vacuums I guess called it um I guess they groom themselves incredibly effectively and can actually help clear out some of the ticks from your yard or whatever but it sounds like there's no creature like a possum for these um different winter ticks\nYeah correct and and even with ... you know possums don't go around searching for ticks to eat like you said they're they're very effective in grooming themselves if they happen to pick some up in your yard they'll they'll kill the ones that are on them but but they're not actively searching out to feed on ticks and that or\nThere's really not much that will do that and as Peter mentioned with with larval winter ticks there I mean they're\nYou know about the size of the tip of a very sharp pencils\nAlright well thank you for the question Celia end to Jeff and Peter Brown Hi Jeff you're on the air welcome to the exchange\nAnd like we do [laughter]\n\nYeah thanks for the question Jeff their way to mess around with that sort of genetic seventies um animals I was gonna say insects but I Know\nThere are ... [laughter] um I don't know the answer to that but the difference that would have to be considered as that ... we know where mosquitos breed we can you know they need water standing water but\nThese ticks are across the entire landscape there there there are hot spots of where because essentially where the adult female drops that's where her\nEggs will be laid and those larval ticks will be and we've looked at some of this by following the same most annoying where they're located in\nIn the spring and fall season and it's a highly predictable that they will return to that spot the following fall so the irony is that a single moves could be picking up its own ticks the following\nAt you know the fall fall and spring the adult females drive from it which is you know just like a nightmare yeah All right\nThank you for the call and here's an email from Nancy is there a way to provide food for them especially food for the cat in the early spring so they can build up strength to fight the ticks fancy it's good question and then you know we talked earlier about ah these incredible\nHow partly because they've just small and they can't handle the blood loss Nancy says can we feed them so they have a fighting chance\nYeah this kind of goes back to a beach comments about\nKeeping keeping wildlife wild um again you know that's not really a long term solution to this issue um again cos good probably would be cost prohibitive\nUm this is another kind of avenue or moose are quite a bit different from dear I'm where there's not really readily available things you can throw in the landscape you know most are by far the they browse on what he vegetation\nUm and there's already plenty of that on the landscape for them again you know in the spring it's it's not necessarily the most nutritious stuff for them but but it's not easy to just dump a bunch of food out there for them\nYou know I Would just add that again we do a field and the crops have every dead animal in every calf ever looked at has a full stomach of food and I've ... to the animals have food in their mouth they literally fall over dead from acute anemia\nW.

result is that a high frequency of these what we call winter pickup as water with very high cat mortality and spring it's really unprecedented in North America ... with that\nSo we defined that by over fifty percent of cabs dying a in late winter early spring\nAnd that's kind of crazy right I mean fifty percent of cabs dying doesn't sound good for the future of this most population\nWhat's really crazy is this is in some of the best most habitat imaginable\nGive us a little more than ... oh how great is it for yeah so a great should it be for those\nYeah many people aren't aware of the New England northern New England is actually most central or forty states there are more most in this region than anywhere else in the country bar Alaska and um\nOur problems can specifically relate to that we're at the southern ranger moves and that's really part of this issue and why we you don't have a climate changes is part of the discussion and how that impacts\nSupport for an HP our live

these these high mortality rates that we've been seeing in most cabs over the years is is is astounding um I Know some some of the first research that we did was moose and the state you know we we had one year where we had about fifty percent mortality and that stood out\nUm and and it's just been consistent year after year um what what seemed like an outlier has become the norm\nAnd I've read I think in your research that Seventy percent now mortality for cats is that right Pete that was the latest\nThe number of average of for the five years or five years or completed a we we still are tracking those currently radio collared most um we had one year over ... and interestingly that year we had the September drought people might remember in two thousand Seventeen\nUh chicks are are highly susceptible to Des occasion and very dry windy conditions and that was the month of September of that year and then winter came by mid November and that's really key in this story and the winters start later and later or autumn czar extended\nUh in the last decade or so and uh I mean really noticeably so this place to the advantage of the tick so\nWe like a dry weather [laughter] when it comes to getting ready to that takes their decimated the moose and we like an early frost and early winter\nYeah I'm I'm not advocating for drought but yeah it's benefits and its drawbacks right um but certainly we like to believe that we could have a normal winter in New England but the real question is what is normal today\nSo I Want to get into the ticks and how they you know I'm I really harming them loose and so forth but just before we do that guys how do you gauge the moose population decline um this headline of\nYou know a dramatic decline in most populations because depending on when you start counting they're eating more moves or fewer most in New Hampshire today and dental twenty first for example from fish and game\nUm fish and game says the moose population was only fifty animals in Nineteen fifty grew to sixteen hundred by the late eighties Nineteen eighty eight\nThen they must population peaked in the Nineteen nineties between seven thousand in Seventy five hundred moose cell when we talk about decline how should we really look at this\nYeah so when typically when we're talking about declined we're talking about the client from when the when we kind of reintroduce the hunter the state in the eighties\nUm that's when we started getting more data on what the most population was there was a study that was done I'm doing some aerial survey work um that we we then correlated with a hunter observation surveys [noise]\nUm and we use that data that come up with population estimates so those are more recent numbers kind of since we started the hunting and had some research done so we're talking we're we're we're looking at the decline from from the eighties\nFrom the eighties so is it possible that part of the reason we're seeing these problems at them loose Dan and Peter and hear from you too is that we had too many um in the early nineties I mean we hear about this with deer for example when there's too many dear you know there's not enough food and they all get sick and um and that's not good either\nYeah so that that could that ... that's\nPart of the story I think um you know we did have a really really low population um and typically when you have populations that are low you have lots of resources of the most popular\nAnd in the northern part of the state there was some evidence that maybe we over shot what we should have had on the landscape um but but all the research we've conducted since then suggests that habitat quality is is not the big issue here\nSo again it's Pete said habitat is great for most of the winner takes and the warmer winters that encourage their growth can jump in on that to Pete on the idea that some biologist they're talking about that I'm part of this decline is because there was an unhealthy levels of movies uh you know a decade\nOr so um well I I think as Dan said we shouldn't expect to maintain a population at the highest level we've ever measured it I mean there's tremendous expense expansion and population growth naturally that will pull itself back\nUm you know as an example some of these moose dispersed in Connecticut ah the\nDense population density and the Berkshires of Massachusetts was quite high for a while\nBut that's which is far south that's right that's not moose habitat but that just showed how expansive an explosive population response was to a tremendous force harvesting levels in the Nineteen eighties um so it had to come back and that's part of this decline\nBut when you lose so many cabs in so many years\nAnd the other factor that we've measured and identified as the productivity of adults has declined when you combine these two things that will drive that population down slowly\nSo female moose might have had two cats um at one time and now they're that almost never happens\nYeah I think the uh the best example of this impact is that year ling moves so this would be the second fall for female about thirty percent of those animals were reproducing one calf\nBack in the early to thousands literally no your lungs breed today young female that's just too weak\nThey're too small I wouldn't you know there there's kind of a whole continuum of health at an animal so you know really robust\nYelling cow should breed the you know up to thirty to fifty percent of those but we're at about zero we're at zero percent today essentially we've had no year link cows reproduce in this study in five years\nAnd then your interview with any parents Annie Ropeik Pete I think you said that um it was not uncommon for a female most to have twins you know a decade ago and now that I almost never happens\nYes we I think a mid to thousands we had about thirty percent of our adult cows winning and we had a big party when we had one couch twin two years ago yeah\nA lot more questions because I Want to remind our listeners though that you can join us we'd love to hear from you your questions comments your own observations about northern

B. R. dot org\nAgain exchange it an H. P. R. dot org your questions comments personal observations about these creatures that we all love to see on the landscape again one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven you can respond on Facebook or Twitter at an H. P. R. exchange\nOur guests are Peter ... UNH professor of wildlife ecology one of the co authors of a recently published study a moose in northern New England and the effect of winter ticks also with us Denver John Deere project leader for New Hampshire fish and game he did his master's degree work with professor ...\nStudying moose and winter take one more time our number one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven one eight hundred eight nine to an H. P. R. and gentlemen lots more commentary from our listeners but\nHe didn't want to just sheer you reiterate again because I think that's an important point it's not so much the severity of the winter that will determine\nHow well the most do it's how early winter begins so just make that point again and remind us why that's important\nYeah so I'm a calf will die from winter to fix based on the ticket load on the calf that's the direct correlation because it's just the function of the blood loss in late march and April so\nPart in part the\nTo gloat Annette calf was simply a function of how active ticks are during autumn and how long autumn is so it's just the game of time really\nIn a a two to three week period that delays the start of winter amounts to forty to fifty percent of the entire time normally that these ticks would be questioning for hosts which is the term for when they're seeking to get on and moves\nUh so it's it's this is why the start of winter is so critical in this story\nEnergy of cabs being an easy winner or the or the most severe winter you know in in the last decade\nSo how we judge a winter I mean we've had winters that started late but boy once they started it was freezing cold and it was piles of snow and you're saying that doesn't matter it's when it starts\nRight because once they get on that animals they're they're pretty secure um they're happy and warmth yeah\nIt doesn't matter what the temperature is outside that's right wow that's really interesting because again from a human perspective a couple of weeks you know it doesn't seem to matter that much but for the moves that matters a lot it's that's\nThe game that's going on out there then you want to jump in\nYet mousse or those were designed to handle severe winters um they're they're much different than deer in that regard\nI'm so severe winters don't necessarily impact motion and these ticks will they kind of go through a dorm and see period after they get on um they'll go through a few different life stages but the bulk of the blood loss takes place of the when they when they built into adults and that's in the spring\nSo again the severity of the winter um does not impact them as much as as when winter starts um how many ticks they're going to get on him and then it's it's in the springtime after the winter's over where you're going to be seeing the impacts\nAnd again the reason that the big concerns on this most recent research Dan is that cat is a really just not making it Seventy percent I think he dies sat at the beginning of show which is devastating all those tax on a young most is even tougher for them to to make it through\nRight yes ... cabs typically will get about the same number of of total ticks on them as as adult most but because of that smaller body size they just can't handle that those massive loads\n'em and they're they're just losing too much blood over a short period of time for their body to be able to replace that and that's during a time of year when they're already energetically stressed and there's there's really no good food out there for 'em yet in the spring\nOr in the northern part of the state typically green up hasn't happened so there's not a lot of\nThere's not a lot of food and I'm Out in the woods for him to find to to help replace all that blood is getting lost\nUm Pete in an interview with them again in each case Annie Ropeik and thank you any of that interview was really helpful to me for preparing for this show you said that winter takes our host specific they prefer moose dear why did win a ticks prefer moose dear [noise]\nWell uh maybe I misspoke no [laughter] I'm they're going to say they're going to latch onto what walks by because there's a lot of deer in New Hampshire there are a lot of deer their primary differences that deer and most are very different and how they clean themselves or\nWeek deer or social groomers if you watch deer they're always grooming all day long and they groom each other oh that's interesting is that yeah and the deer can reach any part of his body with a smile to her it's tough\nPhysically most can't even do that and the thought is that because they really are a much\nA ... a more northern mammal where actual parasites are less common that they simply didn't evolve with these grooming strategies and so this explains why you don't want these ticks are on the animal until that irritation level is so high when the ...\nStages feeding in January and February\nWe don't see any impact on the animal they ... they don't respond to it basically so you know essentially the game is over for them\nAt that point because they can't effectively removed these parasites anyway\nThat's interesting echo parasite by the way is a parasite with a exoskeleton\nOr on the outside I thought OK not inside your your guy or whatever horses that and the parents of okay All right I was close but not really [laughter] you know as I think I think you pass [laughter] than um you've studied deer endless anyone\nIt takes seem to prefer maybe they don't prefer most over\nDear dear just do a better job of getting rid of them that's really interesting\nYeah and that's that's certainly what the research has shown and again it's another one of those kind of perfect storm scenarios here or mousse or a naive hosted this um the thought is is that this parasite did evolve with deer deer and more effective\nUm the peak of chick activity when they're questioning are searching for a host is is right in the middle of when the peak breeding activity for most is\nUm so those animals are moving around on the landscape more which gives them more opportunity to pick these things up um they've done studies on the heights of of the vegetation where these ticks will climbed quest um and the the kind of average height that they quest on vegetation is right at chess title but most of the perfect height for these\nMoves to be picking them up as they're walking around so\nUm it's not necessarily that they prefer most it's just that all these factors are kind of stacked against most um 'cause they'll they'll attached anything that brushes up against them it's just other things are either more effective at grooming or aren't as active during that time of year\nYeah and I did not know that deer were sort of social rumors is that what you said the yeah\nYeah I'm ... and the the other odd thing about this tick is that when we think of about black legged tick sort of deer ticks and lime disease I mean we've all picked up a tick\nBut when these larval ticks are questioning they aren't pods of hundreds yeah I've heard you say that they are all linked together and so when that most brush brushes up against that this is how these animals can have loads\nOn average we've measured fifty thousand ticks but we've had single cast with a hundred thousand ticks\nAnd when I run a physiological model at the you know what's the impact of that blood loss\nAh it's it's a cute anemia in death you just cannot that these animals cannot deal with that\nThe adult the animals are have enough body mass to deal with it but this is why there's an impact on productivity why reproductive rates are lower in a lack of winning and in adult most um\nI think the the piece of data that bothers me the most is what we call the successive breathing rate and normally we'd expect Seventy to eighty percent of adults ... to have a calf every year and that number is fluctuating between twenty five and forty percent and the current study\nOh my gosh again because the females just\nAren't big enough they pay a price to pull a calf off and they they they need an extra year to recover wow\nDan Yan ... you know beat it mentioned the drought that we saw a couple of years ago and and again this is just more evidence pointing to the impact that these ticks are having\n'em when we did have that drought and and most did seem to get one year reprieve from from this problem um you know we did start to see pretty rapidly increases in productivity and success and pointing rates are their success of reproductive rights and winning rate so those things even just with one year did\nDid rebound to some extent but the problem is we don't get multiple years of that we might get that it used to be the opposite where we'd have one outbreak of tax and then they'd have chance to recover and now it's now is we might get one year where they get a break from it All right\nGo back to our listeners gentlemen lots more to talk about again our number one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven to an exchange northern New England moose what we know now about their plight and after hearing researchers in New Hampshire and Maine and Vermont had been working on an extensive multi or a steady on these mammals\nBobbing up tonight with low temperatures in the low to mid thirties then mostly cloudy tomorrow some afternoon showers high temperature is tomorrow mid forties to around fifty degrees [noise]\nThis is an HP on\nThis the exchange I'm Mark annoy tomorrow and our show what's behind rising alcohol use and abuse in America\nThat's tomorrow on the exchange this hour we're looking at the health of northern New England moose with researchers involved\nIn an extensive multi state project studying moose populations\nLet's get you into our conversation we welcome your emails that exchange it an H. P. R. dot org Facebook or Twitter is any PR exchange and our phone number is one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven and a peak peak in Stanford drowned let's go right back to our listeners lots of people jumping in with their questions observations\nConcerns guilt calling in from New Boston Hi Gail go ahead you're on the air\nGood morning morning um yes the conversation has often mentioned that uh the impact of the start of winter and I'm Wondering how you define that I Know that it's not necessarily December twenty first all the time how do we know it it later on\nYeah Gayle good question and sometimes it seems like it's been done and then it stops so that's another factor thank you so much for the question go go ahead be\nA ... we should refer to Dan here because it was his research that that actually identified a the conditions that ticks are basically and they're questioning sure go ahead dance\nStarted winters all relative on on what you're what you're looking at the start of winter for kicks is really when we first get some extensive snowfall that's going to stay on the ground I'm just a frost isn't enough to do it are these ticks you're pretty hearty we actually when we were when we were collecting these out in the field um we would\nAnd we'd storm in the freezer 'em and count 'em at a later date and we would take these flannels out of the freezer and when they would warm up the ticks would start moving again\nOh my so so they can be frozen for a while yeah if if they're even even just extreme cold for a short period of time doesn't quite do it you really need that you really need that snow on the ground um that sticks around for a while in order to stop the questioning and kill these animals be kill these ticks\nSo that's interesting because sometimes you know it does seem like a winter is here and then it warms up again and so you're saying that early start isn't enough it needs to be early and sustained in is that what\nYou're saying early and sustained released several days of of snow on the ground a frost won't do it a a quick snow that comes and goes won't do it it has to be extended snow\nWell it's interesting it's a great question Gayle thank you go ahead please\nSo ah yeah dance research we're actually repeating\nA little bit with the little um\nSidelines to this fall so I have people who are dragging for ticks everyday up north in the game where you were\nThe question is what is tick abundance on landscape and what influences that\nAnd just last week the graduate student that's directing that project came in and go you know they really drop this week we're not picking up any I think that few cold days last weekend there whenever it was his knock them back and I sat there and smile that amount I go you could be so lucky and yesterday I got the email that\nOh my God there's thousands on the sheet today so it's a way Dan described\nReally so it knocks him back and make some quiet for a few days but unless it's sustained for a week or so and they're going to come back\nYet I mean we don't you know we don't have the exact lengths of time but but typically I think a week of a week of snow on the ground would be enough to probably stop questioning um and like you said it's the the short cold snaps will will certainly make them inactive but it it won't kill them\nAll right well let's take another call thank you for that question Gail ah say is calling from Brookfield Hi you're on the air welcome\n[noise] yeah I was curious to know 'em\n... any ah creditors or something that age based or birds or sex or anything like it's probably that's probably an obvious answer to that they're out of control but I was just curious if there's anything that each them\nWell see I Love the question 'cause you know almost everybody is concerned about the moose and we all want to not see those pictures of ghost moves I'm struggling and hear about these dying cat so thank you say go ahead Dan\nYeah there are there are a number of things that will eat them and they actually did some research in Canada looking at this there's Mac pies and gray jays and and uh things like that in Canada that they noticed will will actually land on motion pick some of these ticks off and feed on them um\nThere's nothing that feeds on them to the extent that would knock their their populations\nBack so what about something that would feed on them before they get on I mean you talked about how in the summertime that that was fine 'cause the ticks hadn't latched on yet they're kind of hanging out in the tall grasses um so\nYeah the the problem is is that most of the periods when these ticks or an active so you know in the in the springtime the adults drop off they lay eggs um\nAnd and when the larvae hatch out later in the summer um you know that they're they're under the leaf litter I'm so there's we really don't have any you know they're not just sitting out there on the vegetation lie for them to come along and eat I'm the only time that's happening is in the fall and again there's there's nothing out there that each sent enough of them where it would be able to reduce the population\nBecause of their life cycle and how they form um as you explained earlier Pete there's just so many of them\nYeah Dan could explain a kind of a funny story I mean it is hard to ...\nIs that we're talking about this time of year of course if you put a few hundred of them together they're visible but\nWhen they ended his research we had a whole bunch of people in the room and we're all going to count and I did a sheet and said it's clean and\nThey didn't know there she didn't set is clean and then Dan walked over and said did you do that sheet and I said yes and he goes well there's eight right there so you know that's how small they are my eyes weren't good enough to see 'em so they remove me from that process which was pretty funny\nWell actually I'm pushing the question said because we did a show earlier this year as we do practically every spring about Lyme disease and the black lagoon takes a carry Lyme disease and we learned on that show Daniel turn this to you on\nThat ... actually really good um kicked vacuums I guess called it um I guess they groom themselves incredibly effectively and can actually help clear out some of the ticks from your yard or whatever but it sounds like there's no creature like a possum for these um different winter ticks\nYeah correct and and even with ... you know possums don't go around searching for ticks to eat like you said they're they're very effective at grooming themselves if they happen to pick some up in your yard built they'll kill the ones that are on them but but they're not actively searching out to feed on ticks and that or\nThere's really not much that will do that and as Peter mentioned with with larval winter ticks there I mean they're\nYou know about the size of the tip of a very sharp pencils\nAlright well thank you for the question the idea and to Jeff in Peter Brown Hi Jeff you're on the air welcome to the exchange\nAnd like we do [laughter]\nYeah thanks for the question Jeff their way to mess around with that sort of genetics in these um animals have got the insects but I Know\nThere are ... [laughter] um I don't know the answer to that but the difference that would have to be considered as that ... we know where mosquitos breed we can\nYou know they need water standing water but these ticks are across the entire landscape there there\nThere are hot spots of where because essentially where the adult female drops that's where her\nEggs will be late and those larval ticks will be and we looked at some of this by following the same most annoying where they are located in\nIn the spring and fall season and it's a highly predictable that they will return to that spot the following fall so the irony is that a single moves could be picking up its own ticks\nThe following at you know the the false filings spring the adult females drive from it which is you know just like a nightmare yeah All right\nWell thank you for the call and here's an email from Nancy is there a way to provide food for them especially food for the cats in the early spring so they can build up strength to fight the ticks can see it's a good question and then you know we talked earlier about\nAh these incredibly high calf mortality rates and how partly because they've just small and they can't handle the blood loss Nancy said can we feed them so they have a fighting chance\nThis kind of goes back to the beach comments about\nKeeping keeping wildlife wild um again you know that's not really a long term solution to this issue um again cos good probably would be cost prohibitive\nUm this is another kind of avenue where most are quite a bit different from dear I'm where there's not really readily available things you can throw in the landscape you know ... by and far they they browse on what he vegetation\nUm and there's already plenty of that on the landscape for them um again you know in the spring it's it's not necessarily the most nutritious stuff for them but but it's not easy to just\nYeah I Would just add that again we do a field nay crops have every daddy animal in every calf ever looked at has a full stomach of food and I've ... to the animals have food in their mouth they literally fall over dead from acute anemia", "show_name": "The Exchange (NHPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "22"}
