Mehlman Petra that law a history professor at the new school in New York City was walking around her apartment\nJust kind of procrastinating by checking Twitter and I just saw that all of a sudden my whole timeline was\nRetreats I'm with you know various kind of enthusiastic commentaries about um oh my God I Can't believe he's doing this\nThis was the moment when Colin Kaepernick the former Superbowl starting quarterback no better known for protesting racial inequality was known as the new face as Nike's ... campaign believe in something [noise]\nEven if it means sacrificing everything but well people in the tally is timeline expressed surprise that Nike hat aligned itself with such a controversial figure petras that law had a different reaction\nI Am a historian I think historically I'm always like you know where did this come from and so\nHaving spent a lot of time looking at Nike's ads my first thought was like okay this is totally part of this tradition of moving the needle with kind of controversial branding that places sports in athletics in the context of something bigger\nOnly against Martin Kessler takes it from here and Italian moment\nPetra zealous says Nike's tradition of socially conscious branding goes back all the way that the seventies when they released their first women's running line they named issues after kind of\nAll these like ... feminist sayings so you know there's like the liberator today at all seems kind of cheesy like\nBig deal women's empowerment branding but back then you just didn't have a lot of that\nNike has run ads featuring pair Olympians runners who are overweight or in their eighties and in Nineteen Ninety four the company reached out to a man named Rick Munoz they wanted to put them in a commercial here's wreck\nI said to myself if they go through with this it's just going to be unlike anything\nThat anyone has ever seen before just do it didn't really go into this territory and then you know using a

Illustrated Charlotte while they're welcome back\nThank you Karen I'm thrilled to be here Jason gay Wall Street journal I guess that means you're playing the role of the person who is not excited about this baseball postseason I'm On ... about everything current you\nKnow [laughter] All right let's take it away I'm super excited about the red Sox which made being in the press box when they claim strictly I got I got some bad luck 'cause I like\nCouldn't watch for the end of the ninth inning 'cause I was so nervous that freaked out and they want and I was like this is wildly and no one like that\nDid you on cork champagne or whatever\nIt was like cracker jacks and wine in the air and the ... um no but I think\nYou know I Would see were invested in in the LDS as I think a lot of people were because you know Yankees Red Sox first time meeting in the postseason since two thousand four when I was also really invested but what was interesting to me about this series is that I went into it assuming that ever than would be jazz for the rivalry and\nYet when I went to send in Yankee Stadium also I found that fans weren't as dedicated to hating the other team as I expected them to be\nDo you think that part of the issue I mean besides the fact that the dragon was slain you know for but\nAlso the red socks\nLikeable didn't have enough jerks the red Sox Yankees they need more jerk for that rivalry to be really a\nNo Jason that's exactly what people said at Fenway they were like we don't have the same characters you know there's there's not a lot not to like\nAbout Aaron and I still don't know if I go\nInto the locker room and I get yelled at by Yankees PR for trying to talk to him and judges like sorry like he was very nice about it All right Jason what do you think\nI think the Houston Astros fares are dogs they were\nSo annoyed that they had to play all their games I Wonder where they play their games of eight in the morning for the roads are from the Yankees are playing\nPrime time the actors are just fed up with all those east coast media bias\nSo speaking of east coast media bias we should acknowledge the media bias of this panel which is we are three Red Sox dance right\nI mean Jason doesn't care about anything\nTo do there and I said it like I have three title last year that I was wearing Red Sox Jersey so it's just join and get out there Babe Ruth ...\nI'm not even going to pretend care and I'm I'm a Homer but Jason what you just\nSaid about being said it is exactly my thoughts I keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like their new and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nWe want to know that it's like Karen might have you ever had in the year ...\nCare and that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox slightly more if I was just it's it may have waited long enough of the children\nAll right so I Want to move us out of New England and talk about Jimmy Butler he had an exciting returned to minute it's number ... practice on Wednesday\nButler's looking for a trade and to facilitate a trade he reportedly played brilliantly during practice well screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't see on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no but I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me me and my finest numerous sure that's what you're going to do is on the line\nAnd this is a is it not the right way for it to come to think it was the wrong thing to do or what oh no kidding to do I think that\nI was on it okay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to look I Know it's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all their athletes\nBut as frustrating as your situation might be if you were an athlete kids aren't going to do what you do so it's not okay maybe understandable but not OK\nCharlotte I Know you sometimes enjoy it when\nThe NBA ventures into WW story so I'm not going to let you go to Mars you know we do a little concerned about ...\nAbout my reputation look I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler new exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the jump with Rachel\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue I Do think that if I were his teammates it'd be like man but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte's so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was on timber wolves campus for this melt down with advanced warning was somehow a bit of Korea\nI don't want to say I said that\nBut I didn't\nCare and also I have seen you walk into the studio saying you bleeping though [laughter]\nI I don't know if you are one of the cast stones you know this is where the NBA is now it's almost become less in common with a traditional sports league in more like the marvel comics universe where these players are kind of superhero like and they have enemies both on their own squads Anon squads elsewhere\nI I'm just going to leave it at you know Charlotte and made the point that the media is being used here and as a member of the media I'm just going to say hey I don't like the news really\nAnd like I Will give me those clear\nJust just just use me a bill whether\nOur gang you probably know that once more the Alabama Crimson Tide of the number one college football team in the country and you surely know at Alabama head\nCoach Nick Saban hair is once again so key unless it's really nice\nBut all is not well in Tuscaloosa because those ... good for nothing Alabama students are getting increasingly ambivalent about attending one sided football games but once more Nick Saban is on a war against his own student body we're talking friendly fire\nFor their paltry attendance Crimson Tide football games\nHis poor Crimson Tide players look up in the stands in the middle of games\nAnd it looks like a Miami Marlins game up there but here is a thought for Alabama\nPlay some exciting football games begin at reasonable times Nick Saban actually got himself worked up about the student crowd at a football game that began at eleven am Charlotte on a Saturday So they realize that it's legal for a college student to wake up before noon on a weekend [laughter]\nAlso Alabama was playing in Louisiana Lafayette me no no disrespect to Louisiana Lafayette but you know what the score was at halftime what was the score it was seven hundred and Ninety five thousand [laughter] okay forty nine to nothing it was forty I Know nothing about half\nPart of this is a little weird of it take I realized pardon me kind of fees or he's coming from okay I Want to hear and I do because like here's this\nTeam that you have you've devoted your life to making this insane powerhouse and you are the best college football team that has maybe ever existed and then people stop going to your games I'd\nBe like I like are you kidding I did this for you\nI mean I also did it for the millions of dollars\nAnd the prestige and the chance to you know do whatever I Want after this but I Do kind of\nUnderstand but surely you're a fancy parents traveling Sports Illustrated corresponded now you have been to these major college events you know that big time college boards in two thousand Eighteen the last thing that has anything to do with our students boosters vision and prime sponsor\nOkay here's a thought maybe they should pay the students to go to the game\nNow Charlie while they're perfect exactly and the tourism needs to die why would get you out of bed before noon what I Want to figure out a number and\nIt doesn't take much for a college student in college if you paid me like twenty bucks to go to a football game and ...\nJohnny night it from the Baltimore Colts he remembers the man who was never afraid to share with the notion [noise]\nHe remembers long had said life's milestone graduation the

most WNBA stars where men signature issues what gifts but now it's time for the week's news with Charlie Pierce Hi Charlie\nHold your women you only want to talk about his shoe\nSpeaking of shoes Philadelphia Seventy Sixers centered July al indeed has signed a five year deal with Under Armour\nIt'll make in the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote there's a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that because she's look really weird and aside Seventeen\nYes I'm speaking as someone who bought\nAt a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on which I Believe we're using as a car for the problem with what they look fine on the big men right but when you put them on a shelf\nThey look like art auction [laughter] but if anybody can do it it's Joelle envied who has charisma beyond belief a so I mean he's got to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway he thinks of itself like a guard I mean you might think of his own as a Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is\nYeah I mean he said he I'm not really a big man and of course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall\nHe says he can do at all which I guess means you can shoot\nWhen I look out yourself from the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers to just add a stroke [laughter]\nThe college basketball corruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shock shocks you\nYes what shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm or the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bribe big enough to make me care about this bribery trial it's re criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is just silly the players are the ones that are going to get hurt most and the NC double a which was on the ropes in staggering has now found its way back\nTo what it perceives to be the moral high ground and I couldn't be more disgusted\nSpeaking of the players are the ones that get hurt the New York times brought up an interesting question this week and that's who's the real victim here the prosecutors say the victim is the university's\nFans might say at us but the New York times suggests that it's Bryan tags spelling whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia well there's nothing wrong with playing in\nWhat it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian Bull in going to be fine I think he's going to do as a friendship in Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high\nBut again the fact remains is this this whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized by these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years\nOne of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on this show we learned that the woman who is accusing event is star Christiana ... of rape had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document in which run although admitted to non consensual sex\nNow or no lawyer is saying that document with acquired in a computer hacking altered so now what\nWell this is one of the eight thousand reasons why I didn't go to law school I think certainly burden of proof is on ... on his lawyers to prove the thing was hacked that sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden\nOtherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge at All right because it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr Ronaldo who is capable of buying a lot of forensics\nYou've written a lot and your other jobs about the nature of truth and how hard it is to figure out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents I really get confused\nAbout what can we try well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I mean I guess you just have to trust your instincts and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans in Chelsea has decided that just banning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things\nInstead they're going to give offenders the opportunity to quote spend some time with our diversity officers understanding what you did wrong and this time isn't going to be spent in a classroom\nRight oh they're going to take them to Auschwitz which I Will guarantee you most of these people will not connect with\nThe black people their insulting it's a good idea you know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson is placed put up I like inventive thinking on this sort of thing go on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what with mysterious about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii face Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe wasn't in\nOrder but it'd be Wyoming by the way in this game Seventeen to Thirteen but they're starting quarterback Colin McDonald he had some sort of injury that they did not want to disclose somebody came out on the field warmed up wearing a Jersey [laughter]\nYou know throwing the throwing the potato to throw the guy out is or what did he does is a real throwback to the the wild west days of sports and I love it I think it's probably something you can only use wants though [laughter] you can\nFind that's worth reading of Charlie Pierce Sports Illustrated and he joins us each week on only again thanks Charlie Gard [noise]\n\nOn December ninth Nineteen Seventy eight the
