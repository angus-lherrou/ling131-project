Christina Hendricks and Andrew rentals a new episode every Friday on prime video\nNot a lot of people know this but the New Hampshire legislature is the oldest legislature in the country I don't mean like historically it was founded the earliest I mean the people in the legislature voting on bills they're old there's nothing wrong with that\nBut let's think about democracy and legislators represents New Hampshire if they don't you know literally represent us if they don't look like us\nFrom an HP are this is word of mouth your questions answered your state's explored\nWhat does representation mean and we are the people trying to make our local governments more representative first story from Daniella Elly about young people running for office Daniel takes it from here\nIt's a cloudy friday and a few years walking through her conquered neighborhood it's known as the heights it's a mix of older people young working families new immigrants and longtime residents\nShe's knocking on doors and leaving behind fires that say she'll help brings a new generation to the state house\nJust you and says you're sharing\nThis was the first time running for political office she wants to be a state rap and she surprised herself and a lot of people in her neighborhood when she won her Democratic primary by it through to one margin over a well known incumbent\nYour courage in doing this thing because I Want to be a voice that that's how it matter to me\nWas years twenty seven she's a mom to two daughters and pregnant with her third she's a relatively new U.S citizen she moved to the states at sixteen after ten years in a refugee camp in Uzbekistan after she and her family escape from the Taliban when she was just six\nWas he remembers the help her family received when they moved to conquered from Uzbekistan\nVolunteers would drive into the grocery store or a doctor's appointment\nIt met a lot to me you know back then I think that was really\nSomething that was touching my heart I said when I was a citizen I Want to be able to do the same thing\nIf we went to see in the New Hampshire house and November she says she'll bring attention to issues like paid family medical leave funding for public schools and equal housing opportunities all issue she's personally dealt\nWith I Want to be the voice of young people because sadly the New Hampshire is aging and we don't have enough of young people so that I Want to show that\nYounger people has the voice to just saying is in New Hampshire\nWith four hundred state rep seats it seemed like there are a lot of opportunities for young people like ... year to get involved\nBut that's not the case\nIn New Hampshire we like to say we have a citizen legislature and we do\nBut it's a very select citizen legislature when you only get paid a hundred dollars a server two hundred dollars a term deserve\nThat is Lucas ... he's the president of the New Hampshire young Democrats he says it's a challenge to get people with young families or less flexible job to run because of the time commitment they have to make and how little they get paid but this election year\nBoth parties are trying to overcome those obstacles and get folks under the age of forty in the legislature\nDemocrats are feeling fifty two of those candidates and Republicans forty seven\nIt was it was tough to be a young representative when there wasn't really any um there wasn't a network of other young representatives band together and push argues for\nMhm I mean in some ways you still kind of need an affiliation no matter what right do you like you would want a lot of backing from Republicans are from Democrats even if you are sixty eight um you want to see kind of like that majority support\nBecause that's what I'm saying you've got these young people coming into office full of ideas and a fresh energy and I'm wanting to change things wanting to make things better uh and you just got to wonder you know what happens when the rubber meets the road and you know if you don't maybe have political experience do you have\nThe ability to kind of stick by your guns because that's hard when it comes into the actual process of legislating\nRight I think of another part of it though is that just the numbers game like if you just have more young people\nCome in Joe Sweeney was an office back I think in twenty twelve maybe\nThey're maybe ten other people and it's like ten out of four hundred like water you really going to be able to get done on in terms of things that young people are really really caring about so I think even if you have like a mix of\nDemocrats and Republicans\nThere or at least probably be like some consensus on\nWhat issues need to be talked about today because I think from both sides here young people are leaving the state like what are we actually do to keep them here and where young people and we're in this state so like let's talk about it in let's come up with solutions and maybe if we just have the numbers game and can build a coalition of\nYoung people and maybe we can start to change with that legislation looks like\nWell a thank you for talking thanks for having me up and coming up it's not just young people trying to raise their numbers in local government [noise] more women are running for office here in New England and across the country after the break we talked about why that matters [noise]\n\nThis is an age PR with less than two weeks until the mid term President Trump is doing all he can to fire up the Republican base\nReally we're not

[noise]\nBack to word of mouth no New Hampshire public radio [noise]\nWe're back with word of mouth today on the show representation in local government [noise]\nOne year after the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas hearings in the Nineteen Ninety two midterms a wave of female candidates ran for office people called it the year of the woman was a huge moment for gender representation in Congress\nAnd not the time the whole subtext was about women bring a perspective to office that men can't that women are a political group that gender is political\nFor many of us it's always been just that it's been subjects in our next story we're going to be direct and ask what do women bring the government's\nDestroy it comes to us from our friend Erika Heilemann over the podcast rumble strip air to take it from here\nThis is from a strip America ... and I remember coming through the intersection and I'm sure it and so one of the people I was with pick me up for a minute so I could see above the crowd and I remember seeing people in every direction as far as I could see\nIt was a feeling of um\nIt was a feeling of of an ocean and I looked out over the sea of people that have come to Washington that day to sort of reclaiming America redefining America and I knew that all I had to do was raised my hand and say yeah I'm a part\nOf this I Want to be a part of this book\nThat's Kathleen James she's running for the Vermont house this November\nAnd this is a show about women running for office it's not about policies or issues you're not going to learn where these women stand on health care or public education it's just about the fact of being a woman running for office and the truth is I'm tired of hearing about women running for office\nI think there's an assumption that I already know why that's a good thing I mean we're over fifty percent of the population so there's that\nBut the fact of being a woman running for office of not being a man running for office\nAnd I don't think we're supposed to talk to explicitly about that so I figured it would be interesting to talk explicitly about that with some women running for office and it turns out these women had plenty to say\nAnd it also turns out they're all people I'd want to have a beer with initial you'll hear from Kathleen James and Becca white both running for the Vermont house\nYou'll hear from Christine hall Quist a transgender woman and the Democratic nominee for governor Andrews hearty a candidate for state Senate and the executive director of emerge Vermont which recruits and trains women to run for office here's Bruce Hardy\n[noise] why is this topic of women running for office so boring to me\n[laughter] the topic of the tank wave um [noise] well I think that the pink wave is kind of sound\nDidn't in a way that it's no longer interesting and in the same way that a really organic story about an individual woman running we all have our own reasons to run and the pink wave kind of categorize this as all as one human being but decided to run at\nThe same time when I talk to my about myself as a woman running for office I don't assume that people are going to vote for me because it\nThe best candidate and as part of the reason I Am the best candidate is because of the experiences I've had as a mother and a woman\nAnd because of the experiences I've had in public service in a my professional life and me being a woman is part of that package and what we need today in politics is the kind of\nPublic servant that women tend to be which is open which is listening and valuing diverse perspectives and valuing inclusive process that brings everybody to the table um and that's what\nThat's what women usually do we have been for centuries doing that and that's what we're going to continue to do it for a left it [laughter]\nI really think in a gender is a social construct this is Christine home class and we created the social construct of men so they go to war so we build this you know we disconnect promotions or decisions are\nBeyond reproach that you know that's not the way you get the most out of people\nDid you assume when you transition you already understood all of the cultural gesture all aspects of being female and were you surprised I never\nAssumed that yes I I knew I was different from a gender standpoint from the day the day I can remember growing up\nI had received so much abuse as a young child that in ninth grade I said I Need I literally remember making the decision I Need to act like a man and I did and so I acted like a mad my whole life so I had the whole man thing down very well\nBut but the reality is you know when I look at the the leadership style to talk about this and I and I hope I don't well in my defense of men out there but if I look at the leadership style that we have today this command and control leadership\nIt's not very useful you know I like to say command and control is great during fire power outages but but the rest time you should be leading through collaboration right so you know and looking at a\nFeminine leadership versus masking leadership feminine and leadership so much better for humanity today especially with the issues we face ...\nWomen are socialized to listen again here's Bruce Hardy you know how many dates have we been on where our date just talks talks talks talks talks talks and doesn't ask us a dam question you know so we we listen and then through listening\nYou learn a lot about another person but their concern what they're worried what their fears are how what their values are and their vision\nAnd I find on the campaign trail I mentioned I knocked on\nOver a thousand doors and when you knock on the door you don't know who's going to answer what what's going to be going on with that person behind the door\nAnd this one woman who I talked to a couple of weeks ago she just met me I'd never met this woman before and I was standing there in her yard as she was gardening and she told me about the death of her husband and the death of her mother and how much she missed them\nAnd\nThen she related it to the fact that she really wanted to make sure that medication less affordable so for me as somebody who is campaigning my nugget was okay affordable drugs is important\nBut that connection with her as a human being and that connection about loss and connection about love\nInteresting I'll give myself that caring person who feels really passionate about community service and public service and is that enough\nAnd I'm a mom is that enough and despite the feeling I had of calling and the feelings that I wanted to do it that I was gonna do it all this powerful feelings I talked about feeling during the women's march\nWhen it came down to actually announcing or saying I'm going to run for the state house boy those devils have doubts start just nine or ... years fine\nAnd they tell you you're not enough you know you're just a woman sitting around and baggy khaki shorts like what the\nHell are you thinking but I started to hear a lot of people say our stories are our power\nAnd you've got a story and you've got to power why don't you give it a shot\nAnd that is what I'm trying to do\nBut [noise]\nWe're talking not about issues we're talking about running for office as a woman\nAnd somebody could say this is just to this is even just the fact that this conversation is somehow pulling the woman card is this a relevant conversation relevant topic is worthy of discussion and why why why [noise]\nI of course I think it's relevant um women running an serving at office especially this year after we have the twenty sixteen election where every card was pulled pretty much and played out of the deck and some of them in a really horrifying way\nI mean we've seen blatantly sexist massaging mystic campaigning and women are like damn it I'm done with this I'm going to talk about how I was raped I'm going to talk about how I was over\nOr job I'm going to talk about how you don't get paid as much as my male counterparts I'm going to talk about all of it I'm going to pull every single woman card because every single card was pulled against women and twenty sixteen\nAnd it's fair also because of the conversation we just had about how their strengths that women bring to the table that men can't bring to the table\nAnd so saying hey look there are some things that I Can't I can do that you can't do and the reason I can do that and it's because I'm a woman because I'm a mom or because I've had these life experiences that you don't have\nThat's completely fair manner pulled them out cards for all of eternity our whole entire existence in this world our entire human history that's been about men playing the men card\nAnd now it's time for us to pull the woman card and we need to be in elected office and we need to be represented\nIt's time to set up [laughter] [laughter]\nI genuinely believe them the day I die I'm gonna look back\nAnd know that America ruled forward\nLike a ways that the wave receded and we took a big scary step backwards and that then all\nThe people in this country of both parties who genuinely believe in the same things in genuinely believe in the ideals of this country took a deep breath and\nPushed a huge way forward that's going to take his beyond where we were before I Believe that and it's why I'm running and I think I'm going to see it and I think we're all going to see as\nThe boom boom boom boom boom [laughter]\nProducer Erica Hi omen you can hear more of her excellent podcast rumble

H.\nFund so it was going to explain it to us\nI'm so my name is Dr Cary walnuts and I am in the office of the director at the national institutes of health where I served as both the associate director for science policy as well as the acting chief of staff to the un I stricter\nSo why don't we just start very basic what is the primary role of the end I H in the United states\nSo the mission of the national institutes of health is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and then we apply that knowledge in order to enhance health linked in life reduce illness and disability so essentially we are a\nResearch funding agency whose goal is to improve the length and quality of human life and health\nAnd when you say institutes of health and it told me or the the ... Institute Institute how many Institute's comprise the image\nSo there are twenty seven Institute's and centers which range from Institute's that are diseases focus so for example the national Cancer Institute to Institute that are more focused around organ systems like the national\nHeart lung and blood Institute's to Institute's that are really about a engineering fundamental discovery and the research pipeline itself for example our National Center on advancing translational sciences\nAnd where does the ... get the money for all these ones too\nSo we are a federal agency so we get appropriations from Congress and ah the Institute's center is each get their own congressional appropriation uh and uh so that funding comes directly from Congress and the American taxpayers\nCan you tell me about how much money really urge gets a year to year\nUm so our ah currents appropriation is right around thirty seven billion dollars a but importantly a between Nineteen Ninety eight and two thousand and three there was a significant investment in the national institutes of health the budget of the research agency doubled at that time\nAnd that was a reflection of a strong bipartisan support in Congress or that remains to this day\nSo when something like an Ebola outbreak happens in the U.S you know we didn't episode actually on the CDC and I think of that as the organization that takes care of an infectious outbreak but it sounds like the NIH is the institution conducting the research so how does that work are you are you guys developing\nThe the vaccines and medication the new information\nThat's exactly right so there are a couple of rules and I aged might play dependent on the shape of the outbreak\nUm certainly we are very involved in\nUm working closely with the CDC or for the next stage of developing medical counter measures and those might be vaccines they might be medications um they might be diagnostic technologies in addition um if it is a emerging\nUm virus or or disease that we don't know much about for example when SARS um first uh became\nA public health issue um and I might be involved in some of the very fundamental identification and characterizing of whatever that um infectious agents or disease causes\nSo it was the head of the major pointed as as a political appointee by the president heads of other agencies\nYes so I'm uh\nAnd only two um and the head of the national institutes of health is a presidential appointee and so is the head of the national Cancer Institute", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Word of Mouth (NHPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "27"}
