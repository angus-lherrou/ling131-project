I'm ... and this is word of mouth and your questions answered here said employed so today on the show we've got a special presentation a new HP our podcast\nThat is depending on higher accounting either two years in the making worth Thirty years in the making it the true crime story told over six sort of seven episodes called the bear brook and we're in a studio at the hell is Jason Jason what's your actual job title in each fear\nWhat is my job ... a reporter is safe to say I'm a reporter in the newsroom here what's your what's your beat usually well before the podcasts are covered education and the sea coast of New Hampshire such as it is Thirteen miles of it um after the podcast will be covering health\nOkay so I Am going to wait to ask you how you went from education to murder of well we'll talk about that after we listen to the first episode we're going to do that now in its entirety I'm Jason is going to stick around tell us afterwards how the project came to be what to expect later in the series um and how true crime reporting compares to covering\nSay education in before we get play listeners should know that there is some graphic details and the pie yes it is\nUse where a bunch of kids wandered the neighborhood I bicycles and then stumbled into a mystery story starts kind of like that [noise]\nYou know growing up and there was probably a good two or three dozen kids that lived in the park and we just roam the place like we own the place [noise]\n\nAt Jessie Morgan [noise] in the movie version of his story he'd probably be the leader of the group\nScrappy won the Corey Feldman the way the trailer parks work I mean there's a lot of people that come in and go well I mean I was one of the few kids that moved in when I was too because you do when I was\nEighteen in the summer of Nineteen eighty five Jesse was eleven years old it was the year the Nintendo came to North America new coke hit the shelves and Calvin and Hobbes started running and newspapers that year Jesse and his friends came up with a game\nIt was basically hide and seek except the seeker wrote around on a four wheeler [noise]\nAll the kids would hide in the last one that got found would be able to ride the full real or just do that over and over and we we play we played all summer long [noise]\nThe trailer park where a judge who grew up in a town so small that half of its main street is technically in another village and right next to the trailer park covering more than half of the entire town is Fifteen ... square miles of tall red pines in swampy tangles forced\n... state park [noise]\nWe were able to Rome because we weren't in in a city you know we weren't my parents were worried so much about me because they just figured I was over there are over there you know there's only so many places to go when we were kids [noise]\nIn one day in the middle of this game something strange happens Jesse was riding a four wheeler is friends Scott and key we're supposed to be hiding and then one of them gave himself away by yelling out I Believe it was keys said that he found\nThe call was from a hunter my pleasure drove out to meet him at the edge of the woods\nAnd I met him and he and he said I think you need to go up on the hill and pick a Latina Barrows 'cause I\nThink there's there's a body up there\nMy pleasure remembers that the hunter looked pail you don't want to stay behind with the squad car while he had it out into the woods alone I\nKnow in the area knew that a lot of people would dispose of their pets back there\nThey cannot put on our side it's probably an animal and it was hunting season somebody maybe\nHad you know gotten a deer and brought the clock is out there\nHe struck out through the woods first along the Manhattan then eventually Bush backing him in the ... the\nThe barrel is on the ground and there was a bag and when I open the back of my\nFace was ... I was looking right I mean\nIt was November Nineteen eighty five a few months after Jessie Morgan and friends have kicked over the arrows\nNow officer my pleasure was looking at that same Darryl but unlike the kids you knew what was really into\n\nThis is word of mouth today we're presenting the first episode of an HBO ... new true crime pod cast to bear Brooke hosted by Jason moon is more coming up after a break [noise]\nGood evening here listening to the word of mouth here on New Hampshire public radio where support comes from you our listeners ... gets into the store and conquered downtown meeting place for books greeting cards gains toys and coffee counter author book signings and events that gets since bookstore dot com\nAnd from North branch construction celebrating sixty years in business on time on budget on line at north branch dot net\nCan be partly cloudy night with Lowes in the sixties for tomorrow partly sunny humid with heights between Seventy and eighty degrees [noise]\nThis is an H. P. R.\n\nWelcome back to word of mouth today we're protecting the first episode of in each PR is new true crime pie cast Barack hosted by Jason in\nAllentown police officer Ron my pleasure found himself alone in the woods\nConfronted by the face of the human remains he had just discovered\nThe weight of the situation began to press down on this is major you know says this is this is this isn't you know somebody pocket and the fire lane this this is it's got forty people run says his training from the police academy suddenly kicked in he knew what to do not like security area\n[noise] he began staking out\nAside from the barrel there wasn't much else to see trees and how exactly do you stake out a perimeter in the forest this big how far do you stretch the police tape [noise]\nMy pleasure radioed for backup he was the only patrolling on duty so pounds down officers must have been called in from their homes and even then cops turned to local residents for help\nBut I think I was still in bed and I we hear knock on the door I get up and it was the police said Kevin [noise] we need a deputy ties you to keep the press\nAnd they told me that they found was up at the bit\nAs Kevin Morgan put on his boots to go help the police his wife and was suddenly reminded of something their son Jesse had told her a few months earlier\nAbout a game of hide and seek the barrel that they found in the woods that just came to me [noise] you know this now\nOr you know it came out like no you said\nHow long's the barrel lining their\nHow many times had people walked right by [noise] never realizing what was out there [noise]\nI just I just know that [noise] that that was the one [noise]\nThe barrel contained two bodies\nOne was a woman the other young girl investigators haven't released photos of the remains so I haven't seen them the details they have released though are grim\nThe remains are almost entirely skeletal they were Newt they were dismembered apparently to fit inside the barrel and they were wrapped in plastic tied together with electrical wire\nTheir goals reveal that they were both killed by blows to the head with a blunt instrument based on the level of decomposition investigators gassed the bodies had been in the barrel from anywhere from several months to a few years [laughter]\nInvestigators often say that in a missing persons case the first forty eight hours in the most important is because if you don't find the person by then your odds of ever finding them are really small\nIn a murder case the first priority is to identify the victims and most victims no they're killers but to know who the victim knew you have to know who the victim in\nAnd just like in a missing persons case if investigators don't get this part figured out their odds of success are really small [noise] New Hampshire state police took the lead in the ... investigation\nAnd they immediately began by trying to id the victims [noise] they're working theory was that given the ages the victims were likely a mother and daughter\nSo they started searching for missing persons report that matched [noise]\nMeanwhile the Allentown pd started canvassing the town my pleasure says that's usually how crimes in Allentown resolved with all those neighborhood barbecues not to mention all the drinking gossip had a way of getting around\nAnd he had his ways of getting it out of people\nWe used to call it plus to go fishing [noise] do you make a motor vehicle stop and you knew somebody that may have known some information about a ride my my language you know any good fishing spots [noise]\nAnd now they're doing what I was talking about when we weren't actually going fishing but you know that meant the difference between I mean either receiving a warning or receiving a summons are just helping me out\nAnd it was always somebody I knew I was fishing spot hot ways\nThat this is how police work went in our town in Nineteen eighty five no high tech forensics team no criminal psychologist coming up with a suspect profiled just a few patrol officers like my pleasure rattling the bushes hoping something would fall and [noise] only nothing did\nAnd that was the first thing that that throw me off is like a strange 'cause everybody knew everything over there\nMeanwhile the state police were having their own issues they couldn't find any reports of missing mother and daughter not in New Hampshire not in neighboring states not anywhere whoever these people were it seemed that no one was looking for them\nAs a month started to roll by police tried lots of ways to get any sort of a foothold in that case they check the records of every elementary school in the state for some trace of the child victim they\nExamined five years of campground records at ... state park they\nSent out nationwide bulletins to law enforcement agencies with descriptions of the victims they looked for matches to the adult victim and FBI databases of dental records none of it worked one corporal in the New Hampshire state police called it the most frustrating case of his life\nIn Nineteen eighty six several months after the barrel was discovered composite sketches of the victims were made the artist didn't have a lot to go on just their hair and bone structure so there was a lot of room for interpretation\nBut however an accurate they may be the sketches do manage to give the victims some measure of identity\nSince no one knew what they looked like in life seeing the drawings was kind of like seeing them for the first time\n\nThe adult victim looks tired\nHer faces long cheeks a little gaunt a shadow falls across her face\nDetectives estimate she was in her mid to late twenties when she died she was between five foot two and five foot eight kid waiting light brown hair [noise]\n\nThe girl is drawn in profile just a small Turner knows she wears a ponytail dirty blonde hair with bank swept across her forehead [noise] detectives thinks she was somewhere around nine or ten years old when she was [noise]\nWhen he sketches were released call starting to come in and\nInvestigate or thought they might have something\nBut none of the tips panned out [noise]\nThey'll come back to word of mouth your questions answered your state exploring I Am tailored for me I'm Jackie how and we're in the studio with Jason moon a reporter here it in each PR and hosting the new podcast bear Brooke [noise]\nSo we just listened to the first episode Jason you mentioned towards the beginning\nA little bit you talk about this but how did you wind up covering this story it's not really in your job description no not\nExactly in a kind of the least interesting way for a reporter to find a story a press conference so we got a press release from the attorney general's office that there was new information about a cold case\nAnd I was just kind of the person standing in the newsroom at the right or wrong time depending how you look at it and I got assigned to cover the press conference and\nThat was my first initiation into the case I didn't know anything about it and then\nFrom there um I just I never stopped\n[laughter] were you super confused when you first got into it confused the\nRebut it more I think is the is the better word um I mean just the you know the bear facts of the case are are pretty\nIn throwing I mean here you have a basically a family murdered and discarded in the woods and no one knows who they are and just how does that happen yeah didn't anyone noticed that they had gone missing\nAnd then on top of that there was this do hum scientific technique that they were using them remains that also really interested me in and you know as the basis for some of the waiter episodes in the ...\nYeah I was going to get a little warning here 'cause we're likely in this conversation to spoil some of the stuff coming up later I'm although it is all information that people could find on the Internet should they want to but I guess knowing that we are going to talk about some of these things um what about this case and makes it really stand out from a historic perspective [noise]\nWell it really pushed the boundaries of forensic science in some important ways that um I pressed the easiest way to explain it is that if people have a remember from earlier this year the news of the Golden State killer arrest from out in California\nThat case that arrest was made possible because of a new friends a technique that relies on genetic genealogy\nWhat cutting edge science may have solved a decade long cold case that so called Golden State\nKiller morning on wave of new charges piling up against Joe shifty Angela suspected serial killer accused of terrorizing California in the seventies\nAnd and the detectives working the Golden State killer case we're actually inspired by the use of that technique in the ... case and so it really it was a proof of concept for\nCriminal investigations that this could be used that it could help solve cases that have been unsolved for decades you know some some seemingly an solvable until this technique comes around and so it really kicked off what\nEra of criminal investigations where you can use this genetic information people live up loaded on line to catch criminals\nIt's kinda crazy because you know we just listen to the first episode and what you hear is that the investigators have basically nothing\nUm and it's almost like the very fact that there was so little information is what necessitates new technology and so all the stuff that you're talking about this genetic genealogy the reason that it became a tool is because there was just none of the usual stuff that you need to solve a murder case\nYeah that's a good point I mean uh the what's the phrase ... invention is the mother of a necessity or the other way round [laughter] it's one of those my mother is invention she's necessary [laughter]\nYeah it is true it police really I mean that's why you turn to forensics in general and and police investigation is because you don't have witnesses you don't have the sort of you know the low hanging fruit just isn't there\n... so looking back on a case it started Thirty years ago how do you perceive like I'm sure there's so much information where to start\n[noise] yeah well I'm a good question\nUh I for me I just started back apple location where the bodies were found so I went back to folks who lived in Allentown New Hampshire the Morgan's which we heard from an episode one who you know remember that time the officer who founded\nYou know I tried to focus on people who had firsthand experiences with the case whether that was they were there at the beginning or they you know devoted to significant amount of time working on it I'm like some uh some other folks that will meet later in the series and\nI mean that you know that's one of the things that is that's interesting to me about the case as well as is how it's\nAffected other people I mean you heard from Jessie Morgan who found the ... the first barrel as a kid and really know it but I found out later and and how that kind of changed\nYou know that's a huge moment in his childhood forever right that changes to his own idea of his childhood and what it meant to grow up in Allentown New Hampshire for his parents it change how they thought about their community\nUm for some police officer or is it sort of hot down there was this albatross hanging around their neck you know there's a lot of um personal drama and all that that was really interesting to me as well as as well as everything else I mentioned that that also kept me kept me wanting to hear more about the story\nHere saying alive to cram pie cast like sensationalize murder and that kind of things out planning and with the explosion a huge amount to ... cats out there hey did you go about trying to make their ... and put it in your own voice [noise]\nThat's a good question and I you know I have to be honest I have not yet totally sure that I have that we have accomplished you know I'm I think that ultimately for others to to judge\nBut it was something that I that was always on my mind putting the series together um you know particularly in talking to and talking about the victims in that case [noise]\nUm [noise] it's really difficult in this case because obviously we don't we don't know the victims we don't know anyone who knows who knew them we don't know anything about them um\nSo you have to try to find other ways to you know just remind the listener that these were real people that were really were murdered in left in in the woods in New Hampshire and\nUm you know it's a it's a it's a balancing act between you know keeping that emotional truth\nGrounding you are but meanwhile you know being able to to go out and talk about the the fascinating science about trying to solve their members you know you don't want to lose sight of any of it so you're trying to have to balance all of it and keep it\nI Hope we've done that and I hope we don't we haven't um sensationalized it um but like I said I guess that's up to up to our listeners to um to make that determination\nI said when he was listening to it I I really think you achieve that I don't think it's sensational and it doesn't sound like everything else out there I think\nIt is it is weird though you know there was an article I was reading recently and it was about the true crime genre which by the sort of very formula that it puts out there tends to objectify women as victims so you know usually the set up as\nA woman is murdered and now we're going to sort of investigate you know through detective work in mystery to find out who did that and so they're very role that the murder victim often plays is like pretty superficial you've got a few details and then it's just about the motive um and this case does seem\nSo so much more complicated than that you don't even have the surface details of your victims to to bring out there you know a a body that hasn't been identified is almost by definition an object we call it a body and um although in this case you know potentially you could have started with\nThe killer um who we don't hear anything about for a few episodes you know\nAnd just like it kind of reminds me to sign up as the movie signs or whatever where you know the ... states there that you don't know why you have to do whatever it is kind of like that you like what the heck happened I don't know do you how do you feel being compared to a channel [laughter] and then my right before he like\nYeah that's right and not the mermaid well yeah it was it was before the last year a vendor\nWish to set a terrible movie of all time [laughter] so ah what are the things\nThat was really fun to work on this project with you but also to sort of hear what you did is that you've got to work in a lot of music so how did how did your process go for that\nYeah it was really by necessity in mixing the first episode of the first draft of some of the first episodes\nYou know searching for music that I wanted to not sensationalize this story not overdo it but you know create some in motion for listeners\nI found it was just so time consuming to click through you know I spent ... days literally whole day's clicking through you know MP threes like listening to five seconds of his\nPiece of music and things like no I don't think that's I don't think that's right [noise]\nSo um yeah there was a moment Bob point I reached where I just decided like this will just be faster if I just like hammer out um you know what I considered to be drafts kind of place holder moods music\nTo do it and that turned out to work I went back a few other times a little more intentionally and tried to write out some of the things you know creating a theme um for the series which is always nice to have some continuity consistency\nYeah I'm just I'm actually happy it worked out I feel lucky but it but it worked out that way", "show_name": "Word of Mouth (NHPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "10"}
