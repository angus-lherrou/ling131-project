broke the curse okay oh force\n[noise]\nAnd then I think that's that's quite\nA bit more I think like and the reason I'm asking these questions because\nA lot of people including like the majority of the stations demographic don't really care to follow or follow sports don't paint public radio people with one branch over here that's what I'm doing I mean I painted them all but I mean so so what does this leads to us not really covering sports\nBut I think there's a lot of relevant stuff to dig into and and and the age of kind of activists athletes and shut up and dribble we're going to spend some time looking into the role that sports play in shaping culture and to bring it back to baseball the baseball diamond was one of the earliest sites of racial integration\nSaid the diamond in the field that baseball is planning on\nGetting faster and like a minute [laughter]\nSo can you can you believe that integrating wasn't a smooth process uh hard to believe in the game had an incredibly difficult time integrating black players into the ranks and there are consequences even today because of that history is still not fully understood or dressed\nJust keep the racial stuff out of their herd inward and we'll just see more of an awesome and other cities that are going to say it can just say you know here's here's bag with\nThis this is a long history of of these kind of influence in Boston and you know I spoke with various players of different areas than\nA lot of the things that they told me I Can't say\nThis is Adam Jones one of the few black major league players speaking after a game at Fenway Park in Boston last year he said fans were yelling racist taunts and even through a bag of peanuts Adam but what if I told you that things weren't always this way\nLike what do you mean like there was a time when baseball was actually more inclusive of people of\nColor exactly and what if I told you that the integration of pro baseball in the U.S and the twentieth century the original laboratory happened right here in Nashua New Hampshire\nThe original laboratory I don't know like I Need to hear more\nSo we are right now in Holman Stadium\nThey just celebrated their fiftieth birthday and let's walk on in this kind of like ... around here right yeah every time I come through these gates here I I think about\nYou know the people that came in here before me you know the fans that are generations before my time I saw a different kind of baseball here this is my name is Steve Daly a long time sports writer here in Nashua New Hampshire\nSteve is the author of them little bombs a book that tells the history of the Nashua Dodgers that's the team that integrated pro ball in Nineteen forty six\nNineteen forty six so that Seventy years ago\nYeah yes Seventy years ago I don't know why but that feels a lot longer check this out in Nineteen forty six the average cost of a new house under six thousand dollars\nBoom boom boom\nBoom boom\n... who thought we'd have this kind of history in Nashua yeah right I was very surprised like over and over again just as like just reporting on it\nThat's super cool yeah the fact that baseball is a like Bob Kendrick said um that baseball's integration was kind of start at the civil rights movement\nAnd and he told me that it was the courage that those players had to change the country to something that we can be proud of\nA but speaking of being proud I think it's time that we dig into our local baseball team what do I have a bad feeling about this uh yeah so if we're looking into the history of baseball integration we've got to talk about\nThe Boston Red Sox\nSo the red Sox were the last team to integrate it took them another twelve years after Brooklyn did they even try it out Jackie Robinson a they had a shot at signing ... done nukem Willie Mays almost every\nPlayer of color back in the day they didn't they all lost out yeah I mean the curse of vote\nFor that I mean that was really self inflicted are they also didn't sign a black free agents for another thirty plus years they've had multiple lawsuits filed against them for deliberately barring black players but\nThat means that the the kind of shot themselves in the set like they lost out on some really good players\nRight and and also changing the culture and and I think this gives context of why Boston as a sports town gets such a bad rap amongst athletes\nSo I gave Howard Bryant call he's an author and senior writer for ESPN the magazine he grew up in Boston and his first book was called shut out a story of race in baseball in Boston\nI asked him as someone who had grown up in the city with the history of the red Sox did he grow up as a fan of the team\nWell I think it was more generational for us I mean when when we were kids in the Nineteen seventies the red Sox were great team I remember when the red Sox and Seventy five obviously played and\nWhat's often considered to be the greatest World Series of all time against Cincinnati oh the kids were Red Sox fans there's no doubt about that I remember we grow up in Dorchester and you\nKnow the all black side of Dorchester because of course Dorchester was pretty much segregated part of town and all of the kids at the time rooted for you know Jim Rice and Yaz and ... and pretty car but when the rest of them but\nSupport for an age your lunchroom comes from you our listeners and from community minded to sentence family dealerships serving keen ... all of Chester county giving back to the community for over Thirty years ... dealerships dot com\nRed Sox at all they were all cardinals fans they were Dodgers fans that were all National League fan and of course as I got older I understood why and then it was because the national league integrated the red the red Sox didn't integrate the American league integrated later and\nThose wounds carried over into the generation obviously is as little kids we didn't we didn't make that distinction but the grownups did in that probably explained why none of them took us the games and probably also price and affordability was part of it to\nYour going over like growing up with a team that was a pretty great team um and you had Jim rise to grow up with but you you actually say that your favorite player was Dave Winfield\nYeah and that's as you get older and that was sort of the interesting thing when I was really little I was a Red Sox fan\nAnd then I got older into the eighties when I started to get into high school and middle school and everything like that then you started to realize there were certain identity issues that were important to you and the black players in the red Sox just all seemed really unhappy\nNo oil can Boyd was miserable and Boston germ rice never seem particularly happy in Boston none of the players the players that I really identified with really showed a great joy of being in the city or love of the sport and a lot of ways\nAnd I gravitated toward the the teams greatest enemies which were the Yankees in terms of I remember specifically when\nI realized how much I enjoyed watching Winfield in it was watching him walk to the plate I remember it was eighty one his first year with the with the Yankees and I would watch them grow up to the plate stride head up confident ready to play and that was a guy you wanted to be that was a guy who was taking on the world in a way that sort of\nPeak your imagination as a as a Thirteen year old instead of just sort of of the players in Boston who just were never\nThey never seemed comfortable they never seemed like they enjoyed it maybe that was also as we learned later some of it was just personality based but then we also find out later as you you know as I got older you also sort of recognized that they weren't happy that they didn't want to be\nBoston that they didn't feel that they weren't necessarily appreciated and the city and then you find out of course later the some of the racial\nAnimosity that they went through playing here and also having to have some appreciation for the fact that they also play during one of the most tumultuous times in the city racially during the desegregation crisis\nYeah we'd open the show a with a clip from last year and that's you know Adam Jones is being racially taunted happiness hurled at him a mile at Fenway or ... and in the clip he actually talks about talking to the past and rations of players\nUm this is this is nothing new to the people that had spent a lot of time with the red Sox organization or in Boston and I don't want to ask you is like you know hey thank you for coming on a black sports writer from Boston to um speak on on you know for what is happening in Boston\nBut at the same time I have to ask you like what is happening in Boston like why why is this like\nPlayers from around the league understand that this happens I'm particularly more here\nThat's an\nQuestion and it's a question that I'm not even sure is particularly accurate\nHowever there are some things that are accurate number one what Adam Jones said was that baseball is a white man's sport and he didn't say Boston was a white is a is a white man city for baseball baseball is a white man's sport he's talking about oh thirty teams in all the markets and\nHe's not wrong about that and when you look at the numbers statistically\nYou look at the red Sox makeup today the red Sox and one of the most integrated teams in baseball the red Sox have more black players that most team and and that's very very different and sort of ironic in some ways but to speak about Boston specifically\nI think there are a few reasons I think number one the city has always been shattered by bussing\nI think the recent history of Boston the last fifty years of Boston undermined the previous two hundred years of Boston where Boston had been\nA fairly tolerant decent place for black people to live if you look at the history of African Americans in the city of Boston up until I Would say World War two\nThe history is much much different the history is actually somewhat triumphant one when you compare it to the rest of the country if you look at Boston postwar very very very different story\nI think the second thing that happened from a sports perspective too is the fact the red Sox had\nNever signed a black free agent all those great black players who were available in the free agent era the red Sox didn't sign their first black free agent until the winter of Nineteen Ninety two so you had a combination of whether or not\nThe player chose not to come to Boston for the team chose not to sign black free agents combination of the two really led to that city's reputation because on the one hand if you sign a black player in\nFree agency chances are especially super star player chances are that player is now going to be the face of your franchise they're going to be the most highest paid player they're going to be the one who everybody looks toward\nSo there is that the red Sox also have never had a black manager either I mean Alex core of the team has been around for a hundred and Seventeen years and this is the first year in the hundred and Eighteen year they hired their first minority manager\nAnd and the problem with all of this is you don't have a balanced black culture you\nKnow it's not like it's Baltimore where you still have black culture you get you know fifty five or sixty percent you know black city or Detroit or\nYou know Chicago or LA where you've got a significant amount of black culture to sort of balance all this which is why I say it's not it's not necessarily a Boston thing it's in it's in numbers thing if Boston had black culture and black successes in other places if they could actually elect a black may or something like that\nWe wouldn't be talking about the red Sox the way we are\nBut because there's nothing to counterbalance it the racism of the city and the radio stations and the rest of the ...\nBall comes forward right that permeates can ...\nIt becomes you know it it it becomes the Adam Jones prophecy so it becomes a White City\nYou know if we're we're we're picking up the story from forty seven or with Jackie Robinson on the dodges or even Nineteen fifty nine was home screen you know the red Sox being the last team to integrate\nLives is that that that kind of shook me and and while a Latino representation has risen since Nineteen fifty nine representation of black players has actually dropped in the majors sure it has ... and can you can you put words that can you make sense of that for us\nVery simple it's money in the Nineteen forties and Nineteen fifties the negro leagues where the cheapest source of talent\nThey were the cheapest most available source of talent and Willie Mae sinus for his contract the six thousand dollars Hank Aaron sign for five thousand dollars Hank Aaron signed his first contract for six thousand dollars Jackie Robinson signed his for his contract for I think five thousand dollars and then look at the number of negro leakers who just flooded the major leagues\nThat last guy is Jet Blue G he's in charge of this whole conflict ration remember the two very different force from the two sides of the path from the start of the story one has been left\nAlone for decades and been allowed to grow up dance and thick and the other had been burned a few years before in what's called a prescribed burn now there are a few reasons why would doctor might prescribe a fire for particular patch woods\nBut let's start with the one hand what's going on in this particular New England forest here it's conservationist who are doing these fires in the fall trying to preserve rare plans and birds and bugs\nFor instance whip or will live here that's the bird that things all night long you know they're great to hear but if you live next to one you'd probably want to throw a shoe at it and the birds aren't the only ones who like the open space it also attracts a lot of rare mum on the list right\nNow is we're there's twenty two um state lifted species here so they're rare birds are eating insects\nWe can live with that these whip or will then we're bugs they need to pine barrens to survive and then turn the forests the pine Baron need fire to exist there aren't very dry so\nI'm sort of dry out fast um and you would get lightning strikes not often um you know especially in these northern primaries maybe like every Fifteen or Twenty years or that would light a fire and a lot of it would burn [noise]\nAnd it headlines about wildfires have made you believe that fires entries don't mix that indie rock paper scissors game buyer always beats tree that is not the case the plants in the forest park customers to regular fires\nThey're adapted to not only survived one of the most destructive forces on the planet\nTo thrive on it the dominant tree here is called the pitch pine\nBark they're protected from planes and branches are really high off the ground so they're firewood has to be a huge ... cones are covered with a thick layer of sticky resin that holds them shut\nSo they can't sprout and form a new tree\nThat is until fire comes along to melt the resin\nAnd let them pop open up that way\nAfter a fire has passed and decimated all the competition pitch pines are the first to bounce back and re colonize a Phoenix rising from the ashes and even if you do manage to towards the trees they invest heavily in their roots storing lots of nutrients there so after a fire burns it down to a stump\nThey re sprout like the head of the hydro when it's topped off by a Greek hero and that's not just true the\nPitch pine but virtually all of the trees here like another called the scrub oak\nUm there's apparently a guy on Cape Cod that has been doing this little like backyard experiment who's ... has been continuously cutting every year for Thirty years and it sprouts every year to kill them that way it's pretty tough to kill a scrub of in general I mean you'd have to come out and out here with a bulldozer and plow them out of the ground [laughter]\nPlants\nIn these ecosystems are so deeply coal evolves this fire that they actually encourage fired blueberries eucalyptus months and he just we ferns all of these plants have developed wax the oily leads to their extra flammable\nThey are you there most exploded in the play and that some people call them in the later this is\nPaul game yell fire colleges who's doing a student at the U.S Army Corps of engineers he said this debate over why plans would evolve to be more flammable has been smoldering since Nineteen Seventy\nIt's kind of a paradox why would a plant pills Emily one idea is that if a plant can burn very hot and intensely might burn up its neighbors as well as itself\nIf you're a plant that can grow back after a fire by sprouting from your roots or by being the first to grow back because of your fire activated seen this is good news for you or at least for your genes\nEven though the individual would be will be harmed or killed in the fire its offspring would benefit from it having burned up the neighbors and and this is a hypothesis coke killed by a neighbor\nPlant as arsonist this is a really attractive idea\nBut a lot of ... just point out that flame ability could just as easily be a coincidence as in fire adapted plans have evolved to survive droughts and being eaten by herbivores and grow in poor soils and all these adaptations also just happened to make them more flammable\nBut if this is for real it's an example of plants doing something a lot of us think is just the domain of vertebrates their reshaping the forest engineering their environment to be more welcoming for species like them species that thrive after a fire in these plants\nThey used to run this joint we know from a bunch of different sources that before the Europeans arrived there was a lot more fire on the land and there is today\nThere's this whole spectrum of how well plants tolerate fire and generally speaking everywhere east the Mississippi seems to be sliding away from the fire tolerant to end of the spectrum and that means that force like the pine Baron where we started this story used to be much more common\nSo where all these fires coming from\nAnd most of the eastern United States and in parts of the western United States as well there or something like anywhere from four to six teen plowed to ground lightning strikes per square kilometer\nPer year and each one of those is I'm told hotter than the surface of the sun\n\nOf the story but there's something else in the data to wherever there was fire there were people who started the fire maybe\n\nAn HP ours campaign for innovation has helped make possible exciting new content for\nAnd about in Hampshire like outside in our ... cats that enhances your love the outdoors
