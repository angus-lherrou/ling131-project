I. R. dot com\nHampshire Public radio [noise]\nLooking back to word of mouth today we're protecting the first episode is in each PR it's new true crime pie cast Barack hosted by Jason in\nAllentown police officer Ron my pleasure found himself\nAlone in the woods confronted by the face of the human remains he had just discovered\nThe weight of the situation began to press down on this is major you know says this is this is this isn't you know somebody pocket and then the fire Les Mis is is it's got ... we have people run says his training from the police academy suddenly kicked in he knew what to do and I'm like security area [noise]\n\nHe began staking out the perimeter of a crime scene but aside from the barrel there wasn't much else to see trees and how exactly do you stake out a perimeter in the forest this big how far do you stretch the police tape [noise]\nMy pleasure radioed for backup he was the only patrolling on duty so pounds down officers must have been called in from their homes and even then cops turned to local residents for help\nBut I think I was still in bed and are we hearing knock on the door I get up and it was the police said Kevin [noise] we need a deputy ties you to keep the press\nAnd they told me that they found was up as a bit\nAs Kevin Morgan put on his boots go help the police his wife and was suddenly reminded of something their son Jesse had told her a few months earlier\nAbout a game of hide and seek the barrel that they found in the woods that just came to me [noise] you know the smells\nOr you know it came out like no he said\nHow long's the barrel lining their [noise]\nHow many times had people walked right by [noise] ever realizing what was out\nThere [noise] I just I just know that [noise] that that was the one [noise]\nThe barrel contained two bodies\nOne was a woman the other a young girl investigators haven't released photos of their remains so I haven't seen them the details they have released though are grim\nThe remains are almost entirely skeletal they renewed they were dismembered apparently to fit inside the barrel and they were wrapped in plastic tied together with electrical wire\nTheir goals reveal that they were both killed by blows to the head with a blunt instrument based on the level of decomposition investigators gassed the bodies had been in the barrel from anywhere from several months to a few years [laughter]\nInvestigators often say that in a missing persons case the first forty eight hours of the most important that's because if you don't find the person by then your odds of ever finding them are really small\nIn a murder case the first priority is to identify the victims and most victims no they're killers but to know who the victim knew you had to know who the victim in\nAnd just like in a missing persons case if investigators don't get this part figured out their odds of success are really small [noise] New Hampshire state police took the lead in the ... investigation and they immediately began by trying to id the victims [noise]\nThey're working theory was that given the ages the victims were likely a mother and daughter\nSo they started searching for missing persons reports that matched\nStarted canvassing the town my pleasure says that's usually how crimes in Allentown resolved with all those neighborhood barbecues not to mention all the drinking gossip I had a way of getting around\nAnd he had his ways of getting out of people\nWe used to call it plus go fishing do you make a motor vehicle stop and you knew somebody that may have known some information about a ride my my line was you know any good fishing spots [noise]\nAnd now they knew what I was talking about when we weren't actually going fishing but you know that meant the difference between I mean either receiving a warning or receiving assignments are just helping me out and it was always somebody I knew I was fishing spot hot ways [noise]\n[noise] Mm\nWhether it was a murder or a petty theft this is how police work went in Allentown in Nineteen eighty five no high tech forensics team no criminal psychologist coming up with a suspect profiled just a few patrol officers like Tom pleasure rattling the bushes hoping something would fall and only nothing did\nAnd that was the first thing that that throw me off this like strange 'cause everybody knew everything over there\nMeanwhile the state police were having their own issues they couldn't find any reports of a missing mother and daughter not in New Hampshire not in neighboring states not anywhere whoever these people were it seemed that no one was looking for them\nAs a month started to roll by police tried lots of ways to get any sort of foothold in that case they check the records of every elementary school in the state for some trace of the child victims they examined five years of campground records at ... state park\nSent out nationwide bulletins to law enforcement agencies with descriptions of the victims they looked for matches to the adult victim the FBI databases of dental records none of it worked one corporal in the New Hampshire state police called it the most frustrating case of his life\nIn Nineteen eighty six several months after the barrel was discovered composite sketches of the victims were made the artist didn't have a lot to go on just their hair and bone structure so there was a lot of room for interpretation\nBut however an accurate they may be the sketches do manage to give it to victims some measure of identity\nAnd no one knew what they look like in life seeing the drawings was kinda like seeing them for the first time\n\nThe adult victim looks tired\nOr faces long cheeks a little gaunt a shadow falls across her face\nDetectives estimates she was in her mid to late twenties when she died she was between five foot two and five foot eight [noise] kid waiting light brown hair [noise]\n\nThe girl is drawn in profile she has a small tour knows she wears a ponytail dirty blonde hair bang swept across her forehead detectives thinks she was somewhere around nine or ten years old when she was [noise]\nWhen he sketches were released call started to come in and\nInvestigate or thought they might have something\nBut none of the tips panned out [noise]\nThey'll come back to word of mouth your questions answered state explore and I am tailored for me I'm Jackie how and we're in the studio with Jason moon a reporter here at any age PR and hosting the new podcast bear Brooke [noise]\nSo we just listen to the first episode Jason you mentioned towards the beginning\nA little bit you talk about this but how did you wind up covering this story it's not really in your job description no not\nExactly and and it kind of the least interesting wafer reporter to find a story a press conference so we got a press release from the attorney general's office that there was new information about a cold case\nAnd I was just kind of the person standing in the news room at the right or wrong time depending on how you look at it and I got assigned to cover the press conference and that was my first\nInitiation into the case I didn't know anything about it and then from there um I just I never stopped\n[laughter] were you super confused when you first got into it confused that\nRiveted more I think is a is a better word um I mean just to you know to bear facts of the case or are pretty\nIn throwing I mean here you have a basically a family murdered and discarded in the woods and no one knows who they are and just how does that happen yeah didn't anyone noticed that they had gone missing\nAnd then on top of that there was this new um scientific technique that they were using the remains that also really interested me in and you know as the basis for some of the waiter episodes in the ...\nYeah I was going to give a little warning here 'cause we're likely in this conversation to spoil some of the stuff coming up later I'm although it is all information that people could find on the Internet should they want to but I guess knowing that we're going to talk about some of these things um what about this case it makes it really stand out from a historic perspective [noise] well it really\nPushed the boundaries of forensic science in some important ways it um I pressed the easiest way to explain it is that if people have a remember from earlier this year the news of the Golden State killer arrested for mountain California that\nBecause of a new forensic technique that relies on genetic genealogy\nWhat kind of adds science man sovereign gathered long cold case that so called Golden State killer\nOf hoarding on wave of new charges piling up against Joe syfy Angela suspected serial killer accused of terrorizing California in the seventies\nAnd and the detective work in the Golden State killer case we're actually inspired by the use of that technique in the ... case and so it really it was a proof of concept for\nCriminal investigations that this could be used that it could help solve cases that\nHave been unsolved for decades you know some some seemingly an solvable until this technique comes around\nAnd so it really kicked off what some people are calling a new era of criminal investigations where you can use this genetic information people live up loaded on line to catch criminals\nIt's kind of crazy because you know we just listen to the first episode and what you hear is that investigators have basically nothing\nUm and it's almost like the very fact that there was so little information is what necessitates new technology and so all the stuff that you're talking about this genetic genealogy the reason that it became a tool is because there was just none of the usual stuff that you need to solve a murder case\nYeah that's a good point I mean uh the what's the phrasing invention is the mother of a necessity or the other way round [laughter] it's one of those my mother is invention she's necessary [laughter]\nYeah it is true it police really I mean that's why you turn to forensics in general and police investigation is because you don't have witnesses you don't have the sort of you know the low hanging fruit just isn't there\n... so looking back on a case it started Thirty years ago how do you perceive like I'm sure there's so much information where to start\n[noise] yeah well I'm a good question\nOr I for me I just started back at the location where the bodies were found so I went back to folks who lived in Allentown New Hampshire the Morgan's which we heard from an episode one who you know remember that time the officer who founded\nYou know I tried to focus on people who had firsthand experiences with the case whether that was they were there at the beginning or they ... you know devoted a significant amount of time working on it I'm\nLike some uh some other folks that will meet later in the series and\nI mean that you know that's one of the things that is that's interesting to me about the case as well as is how it's\nAffected other people I mean you heard from Jessie Morgan you've found the ... the first barrel as a kid and really know it but I found out later and and how that kind of changed\nYou know that's a huge moment in his childhood forever right that changes to his own idea of his childhood and what it meant to grow up in Allentown New Hampshire for his parents it changed how they thought about their community\nUm for some police officer or is it sort of haunted than there was this albatross hanging around their neck you know there's a lot of um personal drama and all that that was really interesting to me as well as as well as everything else I mentioned that that also kept me kept me wanting to hear more about the story\nHere saying alive to cram pie cast like sensationalized murder and that kind of things out painting and with the explosion the huge amount of truth ... cast out there how did you go about trying to make the airport unique and put it in your own voice [noise]\nThat's a good question and I you know I have to be honest I had not yet totally sure that I have that we have accomplished you know I'm I think that ultimately for others to to judge but it was something that I that was always\nSupport for an HP ours live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustain excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England is legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you online at or dash Reno dot com\nThat these were real people that were really were murdered and left in in the woods in New Hampshire and um you know it's a it's a it's a balancing act between ... you know keeping that emotional truth\nGrounding you are but meanwhile you know being able to to go out and talk about the the fascinating science about trying to solve their members you know you don't wanna lose sight of any of it so you're trying to have to balance all that and keep it all corral together\nYou know I Hope I Hope we have done that and I hope we don't we haven't um sensationalized it um but like I said I I guess that's up to up to our listeners to um to make that determination\nAs someone who listen to it I [laughter] I really think you achieve that I don't think it's sensational site and it doesn't sound like everything else out there I think it is it is weird\nThough you know there was an article I was reading recently and it was about the true crime genre which by the sort of very formula that it puts out there tends to objectify women as victims so you know usually the set up as\nA woman is murdered and now we're going to sort of investigate you know through detective working mystery to find out who did that and so the very role that the murdered victim often plays is like pretty superficial you get a few details and then it's just about the motive um\nAnd this case does seem so so much more complicated than that you don't even have the surface details of your victims to to bring out there you know a a a body that hasn't been identified is almost by definition an object we call it a body ... um\nAlthough in this case you know potentially you could have started with\nThe killer um who we don't hear anything about for a few episodes\nYou know and just like it kind of reminds me they sign of the movie signs or whatever where you know that the monsters there but you don't know what it is whatever and it's kind of like that you like what the heck happened I don't know do you how do you feel being compared to a shallow [laughter] isn't that right before he like yeah that was not the mermaid yeah\nIt was it was before the laughter vendor which [laughter] is that is terrible movie of all time [laughter] so ah one of the things\nThat um was really fun to work on this project with you but also to sort of hear what you did as you got to work in a lot of music so how did how did your process go for that\nYeah it was really by necessity in mixing the first episode the first draft of some of the first episodes you know searching for music that I wanted to not sensationalize the story not overdo it but you know create some emotion for listeners I\nFound it was just so time consuming to click through you know I spent a whole days literally whole day's clicking through you know and be threes like listening to five seconds of his piece of music can sing I don't think that's I don't think that's right [noise] so\nUm ... there was a moment Bob point I reached to where I just decided like this will just be faster if I'd just like hammer out um you know what I considered to be drafts kind of place holder moods I'm a music\nTo do it and that turned out to work I went back a few other times a little more intentionally and trying to ride out some of the things you know creating a theme um for the series which is always nice to have some continuity consistency\nWorked out if you're lucky that it it worked out that way", "show_name": "Word of Mouth (NHPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "06"}
