was founded the earliest I mean the people in the legislature voting on bills they're old there's nothing wrong with that\nBut let's think about democracy can legislators represents New Hampshire if they don't you know literally represent us if they don't look like us\nFrom an HP are this is word of mouth your questions answered your state's explored our show today tackled that question what does representation mean and who are the people trying to make our local governments more representative\nFirst story from Danielle alley about young people running for office Daniella takes it from here\nIt's a cloudy friday and the feeling here is watching to her Congress neighborhood it's known as the heights it's a mix of older people young working families new immigrants and longtime residents she's knocking on doors and leaving behind fire ... brings a new generation to the fate of the\nGuys are saying you can gradually saying\nWas the first time running for political office she wants to be a state rap\nIn her neighborhood when she won her Democratic primary by two to one margin over a well known incumbent\nYour courage in doing this thing because I Want to be a voice so that's how it matters to me\nWas years twenty seven she's a mom to two daughters and pregnant with her third she's a relatively new U.S citizen she moved to the states at sixteen after ten years in a refugee camp in Uzbekistan after she and her family escaped from the Taliban when she was just six\nWas he remembers the help her family received when they moved to conquered from Uzbekistan\nVolunteers would drive down to the grocery store or a doctor's appointment\nIt met a lot to me you know back then I think that was really\nSomething that was touching my heart I said when I become a citizen I Want to be able to do the same thing\nIf we went to see in the New Hampshire house in November she says she'll bring attention to issues like paid family medical leave funding for public schools and equal housing opportunities all issue she's personally dealt with\nI Want to be the voice of young people because sadly the New Hampshire is aging and we don't have enough of younger people so that I Want to show that\nYounger people has the voice to just saying is and then he Hampshire\nWith four hundred state rep seats it seemed like there are a lot of opportunities for young people liked was easier to get involved but that's not the case\nIn New Hampshire we like to say we have a citizen legislature and we do\nBut it's a very select citizen legislature when you only get paid a hundred dollars to serve or two hundred dollars a term to serve\nThat's ... he's the president of the New Hampshire young Democrats he says it's a challenge to get people with young families or less flexible jobs to run because of the time commitment they have to make\nAnd how little they get paid but this election year both parties are trying to overcome those obstacles and get folks under the age of forty in the legislature\nDemocrats are feeling fifty two of those candidates and Republicans forty seven\nIt was it was tough to be a young representative when there wasn't really any um there wasn't a network of other young represents that could band together and push argues for\nMhm I mean in some ways you still kind of neat and affiliation no matter what right like you would want a lot of racking from Republicans are from Democrats even if you are sixty eight um you know if you want to see kind of like that majority support\nBecause that's what I'm saying you've got these young people coming into office\nFull of ideas and a fresh energy and I'm wanting to change things wanting to make things better uh and you just gotta wonder you know what happens when the rubber meets the road and you know if you don't maybe have political experience do you have\nThe ability to kind of stick by your guns because that's hard when it comes into the actual process of legislating\nRight I think of another part of it though is that just a numbers game I give you just have more young people\nAnd then just Sweeney was in office back I think in twenty twelve maybe maybe ten other people and it's like ten at a four hundred I water you really going to be able to get done on in terms of things that young people are really really caring about so I think even if you have like a mix of Democrats and Republicans\nThere or at least probably be like some consensus on what issues need to be talked about today because I think from both sides here young people are leaving the state like what are we actually do to keep them here and where young people and we're in this state so like let's talk about it and let's come up with solutions and\nMaybe if we just have the numbers game and can build a coalition of young people and maybe we can start to change with that legislation looks like\nWell a didn't ... thank you for talking thanks for having me up and coming up it's not just young people trying to raise their numbers in local government [noise] more women are running for office here in New England and across the country after the break we talk about why

female candidates ran for office people called it the year of the woman was a huge moment for gender representation in Congress\nWas about women bring a perspective to office that men can't that women are a political group that gender is political\nFor many of us it's always been just that it's been subjects in our next story we're going to be direct and ask what do women bring the government's\nThe story comes to us from our friend Erika Heilemann over at the podcast rumble strip Erica takes it from here\nThis is almost with America ... and I remember coming through an intersection and I'm sure it and so one of the people I was with pick me up for a minute so I could see above the crowd and I remember seeing people in every direction as far as I could see\nIt was a feeling of um\nIt was a feeling of of an ocean and I looked out over the sea of people that have come to Washington that day to sort of reclaiming America redefining America and I knew that all I had to do was raised my hand and say yeah I'm a\nPart of this I Want to be a part of this book\nThat's Kathleen James she's running for the Vermont house this November\nAnd this is a show about women running for office it's not about policies or issues you're not going to learn where these women stand on health care or public education it's just about the fact of being a woman running for office and the truth is I'm tired of hearing about women running for office\nI think there's an assumption that I already know why that's a good thing I mean we're over fifty percent of the population so there's that\nBut the fact of being a woman running for office of not being a man running for office\nI don't think we're supposed to talk to explicitly about that so I figured it would be interesting to talk explicitly about that with some women running for office and it turns out these women had plenty to say\nAnd it also turns out they're all people I'd want to have a beer with in this show you'll hear from Kathleen James and Becca white both running for the Vermont house\nYou'll hear from Christine hall quest a transgender woman and the Democratic nominee for governor Andrews hardy a candidate for state Senate and the executive director of emerge Vermont which recruits and trains women to run for office here's Bruce hearty\nWhy is this topic of women running for office so boring to me\n[laughter] the topic of the tank wave um\nWell I think that the pink wave is kind of sound bitten in a way that it's no longer interesting and in the same way that a really organic story about an individual woman running we all have our own reasons to run and the pink wave kind of\nCategorize this as all as one human being that decided to run at the same time\nWhen I talk to my about myself as a woman running for office I don't assume that people are going to vote for me because I'm a woman I assume they're going to vote for me because of the best candidate and that part of the reason I Am the best candidate is because of the experiences I've had as a mother and a woman\nAnd because of the experiences I've had in public service in a my professional life and me being a woman is part of that package and what we need today in politics is the kind of\nPublic servant that women tend to be which is open which is listening and valuing diverse perspectives and valuing inclusive process that brings everybody to the table\nUm and that's what that is what women usually do we have been for centuries doing that\nAnd that's what we're going to continue to do for a less\nI really think in a gender is a social construct this is Christine home fast and we created the social construct of men so they go to war so we build this you know we disconnect promotions or decisions are beyond reproach\nThat you know that's not the way you get the most out of people\nDid you assume when you transition you already understood all of the cultural gesture all aspects of being female and were you surprised I never\nAssumed that yes I I knew I was different from a gender standpoint from the day the day I can remember growing up\nI had received so much abuse as a young child that in ninth grade I said I Need I literally remember making the decision I Need to act like a man and I did and so I acted like a mad my whole life so I had them whole man thing down very well [noise]\nBut but the reality is you know when I look at the the leadership style to talk about this and I and I hope I don't well I might offend some men out there but if I look at the leadership style that we have today was command and control leadership\nIt's not very useful you know I like to say committed control is great during fire power outages but but the rest time you should be leading through collaboration right so you know and looking at a feminine leadership versus basking leadership feminine leadership is so much better for\nHumanity today especially with the issues we face ...\nWomen are socialized to listen again here's Bruce Hardy you know how many dates have we been on where our date just talks talks talks talks talks talks and doesn't ask us a dam question\nYou know so we we listen and then through listening you learn a lot about another person but their concern what they're worried what their fears are how what their values are and their vision and I find on the campaign trail I mentioned I knocked on over a thousand doors\nAnd when you knock on the door you don't know who's going to answer what what's going to be going on with that person behind the door\nAnd this one woman who I talked to a couple of weeks ago she just met me I never met this woman before and I was standing there in her yard that she was gardening and she told me about the death of her husband and the death of her mother and how much she missed them\nAnd then she related it to the fact that she really wanted to make sure that medication less affordable so for me as somebody who is campaigning my nugget was okay affordable drugs is important\nInteresting I'll give myself that caring person who feels really passionate about community service in public service and is that enough\nAnd I'm a mom is that enough\nAnd despite this feeling I had a calling in this feeling that I wanted to do it and that I was gonna do it all this powerful feelings I talked about feeling during the women's march when it came down to actually announcing were saying I'm going to run for the state house\nBoy those devils have doubts start just nine or ... years fine\nAnd they tell you you're not enough you know you're just a woman sitting around and baggy khaki shorts like what the hell are you thinking but I started to hear a lot of people say our stories are our power\nAnd you've got a story and you've got some power why don't you give it a shot\nAnd that is what I'm trying to do\n[noise]\nWe're talking not about issues we're talking about running for office as a woman and somebody could say this is just to\nThis is even just the fact of this conversation is somehow pulling the woman card is this a relevant conversation irrelevant topic isn't worthy of discussion and why why why [noise]\nI of course I think it's relevant um women running and serving it often especially this year after we had the twenty sixteen election where every card was pulled pretty much have played out of the deck and some of them in a really horrifying way\nI mean we've seen blatantly sexist massaging mystic campaigning\nAnd women are like damn it I'm done with this I'm going to talk about how I was raped I'm going to talk about how I was over looked for a promotion or a job I'm going to talk about how I don't get paid as much as my male counterparts I'm going to talk about all of it I'm going to pull every single woman card\nBecause every single card was pulled against women and twenty sixteen\nAnd it's fair also because of the conversation and we just had about how their strengths that women bring to the table that men can't bring to the table\nAnd so saying hey look there are some things that I Can't I can do that you can't do and the reason I can do them is because I'm a woman because I'm a mom or because I've had these life experiences that you don't have that's completely fair\nMen and pulled them out cards for all eternity our whole entire existence in this world our entire human history it's been about men playing the men card and\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in your

H. fun so who's going to explain it to us\nAnd so my name is Dr Cary while in it and I am in the office of the director at the national institutes of health where I served as both the associate director for science policy as well as the acting chief of staff to the NIH director so why don't we just start very basic\nAnd then we apply that knowledge in order to enhance health linked in life reduce illness and disability so essentially we are a research funding agency whose goal is to improve the length and quality of human life and health\nAnd when you say institutes of health and it told me or the the ... Institute Institute how many Institute's comprised beyond age\nSo there are twenty seven Institute's and centers which range from Institute's that our disease focus so for example the national Cancer Institute\nTo Institute that are more focused around organ systems like the national heart lung and blood Institute's to Institute's that are really about a engineering fundamental discovery and the research pipeline itself for example our National Center on advancing translational sciences\nAnd where does the ... get the money for all these ...\nSo we are a federal agency so we get appropriations from Congress and ah the Institute's center is each get their own congressional appropriation uh and uh so that funding comes directly from Congress and the American taxpayers\nTo tell me about how much money really urge gets a year to year\nUm so our ah currents appropriation is right around thirty seven billion dollars a but importantly a between Nineteen Ninety eight and two thousand and three there was a significant investments and the national institutes of health the budget of the research agency doubled at that time\nAnd that was a reflection of a strong bipartisan support in Congress or that remains to this day\nSo when something like an Ebola outbreak happens in the U.S you know we didn't have that actually on the CDC and I think of that as the organization that takes care of an infectious outbreak but it sounds like the NIH is the institution conducting the research so how does that work are you are you guys developing\nThe the vaccines and medication the new information\nThat's exactly right so there are a couple of rules and I aged might play depending on the shape of the outbreak\nUm certainly we are very involved in um working closely with the CDC or for the next stage of developing medical counter measures and those might be vaccines they might be medications um they might be diagnostic technologies in addition um if it is a emerging\nUm virus or or disease that we don't know much about for example when SARS um first uh became\nA public health issue um NIH might be involved in some of the very fundamental identification and characterizing of whatever that um infectious agents or disease causes\nSo it was the head of the major pointed as as a political appointee by the president heads of other agencies yes\nSo I'm a and each has two presidential appointees and only two I'm In the head of the national institutes of health is a presidential appointee and so is the head of the national Cancer Institute", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Word of Mouth (NHPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "31"}
