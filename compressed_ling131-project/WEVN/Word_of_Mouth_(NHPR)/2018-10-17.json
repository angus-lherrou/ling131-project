for the first time when they broke the curse okay oh four\n[noise]\nAnd then I think that's that's\nQuite a bit more I think like and the reason I'm asking these questions because a lot of people including like the majority of the stations demographic don't really care to follow or follow sports don't paint public radio people with one branch over here that's what I'm doing I mean I painted them all but I mean\nSo so what does this leads does not really covering sports but\nI think there's a lot of relevance stuff to dig into and and and the age of kind of activists athletes and shut up and dribble we're going to spend some time looking into the role that sports play in shaping culture and to bring it back to base\nEarliest sites of racial integration\nSo the diamond the field that baseball is planning on\nGetting faster and uh yeah [laughter]\nSo can you can you believe that integrating wasn't a smooth process uh hard to believe in the game had an incredibly difficult time integrating black players into their ranks and there are consequences even today because of that history is still not fully understood or dressed\nJust keep the racial stuff out of their herd then word and would just say here more of an awesome and other cities that are going to say that 'cause they're safe you know here's here's bad with\nThis this is a long history of of these kind of influence in Boston and you know I spoke with various players of different areas than\nA lot of the things that they told me I Can't say\nThis is Adam Jones one of the few black major league players speaking after game at Fenway Park in Boston last year you said fans were yelling racist taunts and even through a bag of peanuts Adam but what if I told you that things weren't always this way\nLike what do you mean like there was a time when baseball was actually more inclusive of people of color\nExactly and what if I told you that the integration of pro baseball in the U.S and the twentieth century the original laboratory happened right here in Nashua New Hampshire\nThe original laboratory I don't know like I Need to hear more\nSo we are right now in Holman Stadium\nThey just celebrated their fiftieth birthday and let's walk on in this kind of like ... around here right a little yeah every time I come through these gates here I\nI think about you know the people that came in here before me you know the fans that are generations before my time sorry different kind of baseball here oh this is my name is Steve Daly a long time sports writer here in Nashua New Hampshire\nSteve is the author of them little bums a book that tells the history of the Nashua Dodgers that's the team the integrated pro ball in Nineteen forty\nSix Nineteen forty six so that Seventy years\nAgo yeah yes Seventy years ago I don't know why but that feels a lot longer check this out in Nineteen forty six the average cost of a new house under six thousand dollars it was the same year the microwave was invented and this iconic Christmas song was brand new\nBoom boom\nBoom boom\n... who thought we'd have this kind of history in Nashua yeah right I was very surprised like over and over again just as like just reporting on it\nThat's super cool yeah the fact that baseball is a like Bob Kendrick said um that baseball's integration was kind of start at the civil rights movement\nAnd and he told me that it was the courage that those players had to change the country to something that we can be proud of 'em but speaking of being proud I think it's time that we dig into our local baseball team let them have that feeling about this uh yeah so if we're looking\nInto the history of baseball integration we've got to talk about the Boston Red Sox\nSo the red Sox were the last team to integrate it took them another twelve years after Brooklyn did they even tried out Jackie Robinson a they had a shot at signing ... done nukem Willie Mays almost every\nPlayer of color back in the day they didn't they all lost out [laughter] yeah I mean that ... vote\nFor that I mean that was really self inflicted are they also didn't sign a black\nFree agent for another thirty plus years they've had multiple lawsuits filed against them for deliberately barring black players but\nI mean that this wasn't the kind of shot themselves in the ... like ... they lost out on some really good players\nRight and and also changing the culture and and I think this gives context of why Boston as a sports town gets such a bad rap amongst athletes\nSo I gave Howard Bryant call he's an author and senior writer for ESPN the magazine he grew up in Boston and his first book was called shut out a story of race and baseball in Boston\nI asked him as someone who had grown up in the city with the history of the red Sox\nDid he grow up as a fan of the team\nWell I think it was more generational for us I mean when when we were kids in the late Nineteen seventies the red Sox were great team I remember when the red Sox and Seventy five obviously played and\nWhat's often considered to be the greatest World Series of all time against Cincinnati oh the kids were Red Sox fans are there's no doubt about that our number and then we grow up in Dorchester and you know the all black side of Dorchester because of course Dorchester was pretty much segregated part of town\nAnd all of the kids at the time rooted for you know Jim Rice and Yaz and ... and burning car but when the rest of them\nBut at the same time there were two things that were taken place the first thing that was taking place for that none of us had ever gone to a game even though Fenway Park wasn't that far from us Fenway Park was a subway ride\nThe second thing that was happening is that the adult none of them rooted for the red Sox at all they were all cardinals fan favorite Dodgers fans they were all National League fan then of course as I got older I understood why and it was because the national league integrated the red the red Sox getting integrate the American league integrated later\nThose wounds carried over into the generation obviously is\nA little kid we didn't we didn't make that distinction but the grown ups that and that probably explained why none of them took us the games and probably also price and affordability was part of it to\nYour going over like growing up with a team that was a pretty great team um and you had\n... you actually say that your favorite player was Dave Winfield\nYeah and that says you get older and that was sort of the interesting thing when I was really little I was a Red Sox fan\nAnd then I got older into the eighties when I started to get into high school and middle school and everything like that then you started to realize there were certain identity issues that were important to you and the black players and the red Sox just all seemed really unhappy\nNo oil can boy was miserable and Boston Jim Rice never seem particularly happy in Boston none of the players the players that I really identified with really showed a great joy of being in the city or love of the sport and a lot of ways\nAnd I gravitated toward the team's greatest enemies which were the Yankees in terms of I remember specifically when\nI realized how much I enjoyed watching Winfield and it was watching them walk to the plate I remember it was eighty one his first year with the with the Yankees and I would watch them grow up to the plate in stride head up confident ready to play\nThat was the guy you wanted to be that was the guy who was taking on the world in a way that sort of picture imagination as a as a Thirteen year old\nInstead of just sort of of the players in Boston who just were never\nNever seemed comfortable they never seemed like they enjoyed it maybe that was also as we learned later some of it was just personality based but then we also find out later as you you know as I got older you also sort of recognize that they weren't happy that they didn't want to be\nIn Boston that they didn't feel that they weren't necessarily appreciated and the city and then you find out of course later the some of the racial animosity that they went through playing here and also having to have some appreciation for the fact that they also play during one of the most tumultuous times in the city racially during the desegregation crisis\nYeah we'd open the show a with a clip from last year and that's you know Adam Jones is being racially taunted happiness hurled at him a ... way a ... and in the clip you actually talks about talking to the past and rations of players\nUm this is this is nothing new to the people that had spent a lot of time with the red Sox organization or in Boston and I don't want to ask you is like you know hey thank you for coming on a black sports writer from Boston too I'm speaking on you know for what is happening in Boston\nBut at the same time I have to ask you like what is happening in Boston like why why is this like\nPlayers from around the league understand that this happens I'm particularly more here\nThat's an\nInteresting question and it's a question that I'm not even sure is particularly accurate however there are some things that are accurate number one but Adam Jones said was that baseball is a white man's sport and he didn't say Boston was a white is a is a white man city for baseball he said baseball is a white man's sport he's talking about\nOh thirty teams in all the markets\nAnd he's not wrong about that and when you look at the numbers statistically it pretty much shows that in fact if you look at the red Sox makeup today the red Sox and one of the most integrated teams in baseball the red Sox have more black players and most team and and that's very very different and sort of ironic in some ways but to speak about Boston specifically\nI think there are a few reasons I think number one the city has always been shattered by bussing\nI think the recent history of Boston the last fifty years of Boston undermined the previous two hundred years of Boston\nWhere Boston had been a a fairly tolerant decent place for black people to live if you look at the history of African Americans in the city of Boston\nUp until\nI Would say World War two the history is much much difference the history is actually somewhat triumphant\nIf you look at Boston postwar\nVery very very different story\nI think the second thing that happened from a sports perspective too is the fact the red Sox had\nNever signed a black free agent all those great black players who were available in the free agent era the red Sox didn't sign their first black free agent until the winter of Nineteen Ninety two so you had\nA combination of whether or not the player chose not to come to Boston for the team chose not to sign black free agents combination of the two really led to that city's reputation because\nOn the one hand if you sign a black player in free agency chances are especially super star player chances are that player is now going to be the face of your franchise they're going to be the most highest paid player they're going to be the one who everybody looks toward\nSo there is that the red Sox also have never had a black manager either I mean Alex core of the team has been around for a hundred and Seventeen years and this is the first year in the hundred and Eighteen year they hired\nFirst minority manager and and the problem with all of this is you don't have a balanced black culture you know it's not like it's Baltimore where you still have black culture you get you know fifty five or sixty percent black city or Detroit or\nYou know Chicago or LA where you've got a significant amount of black culture to sort of balance all this which is why I say it's not it's not necessarily a Boston thing it's in it's in numbers thing if Boston had black culture and black successes in other places if they could actually\nElect a black may or something like that we wouldn't be talking about the red Sox the way we are mhm but because there's nothing to counterbalance it the racism of the city and the radio stations and the rest\nOf it all comes forward right that permeates can ...\nIt becomes you know it it it becomes the Adam Jones prophecy it so it becomes a White City\nYou know if we're we're we're picking up the story from forty seven or with Jackie Robinson on the dodges or even Nineteen fifty nine was home screen you know the red Sox being the last team to integrate\nLives is that that that kind of shook me and and while a Latino representation has risen since Nineteen fifty nine representation of black players has actually dropped in the majors sure it has ... and can you can you put words that can you make sense of that for us\nIt's very simple it's money in the Nineteen forties and Nineteen fifties the negro leagues where the cheapest source of talent\nThey were the cheapest most available source of talent and Willie Mae sinus for his contract the six thousand dollars Hank Aaron sign for five thousand dollars Hank Aaron signed his first contract for six thousand dollars Jackie Robinson signed his for his contractor I think five thousand dollars and then look at the number of negro leaders who just flooded the major leagues\nThat last guy is Jet Blue G he's in charge of this whole conflict ration remember the two very different force from the two sides of the path from the start of the story one has been left\nAlone for decades and been allowed to grow up dance and thick and the other had been burned a few years before\nIn what's called a prescribed burn now there are a few reasons why would doctor might prescribe fire for particular patch of woods\nBut let's start with the one at hand what's going on in this particular New England forest here it's conservationist who are doing these fires in the fall trying to preserve rare plants and birds and bugs\nFor instance whip or will live here\nThat's the bird that things all night long\nYou know they're great to hear but if you live next to one you'd probably want to throw a shoe at it and the birds aren't the only ones who like the open space it also attracts a lot of ... on the list right now is we're there's twenty two um state lifted species here so they're rare birds are eating the rare and sex we can live with that\nThese whip or will and we're bugs they need ... to survive and in turn the forests the pine Baron need fire to exist there aren't\nVery dry soil so that dry out fast um and you would get lightning strikes not often um you know especially in these northern primaries maybe like every Fifteen or Twenty years or that would light a fire and a lot of it would burn [noise]\nAnd it headlines about wildfires have made you believe that fires entries don't mix that indie rock paper scissors game fire always the tree that is not the case the plants in the forests are accustomed to regular fires\nThey're adapted to not only survive one of the most destructive forces on the planet\nBut to thrive on it the dominant tree here is called the pitch pine it has really stick play did the bark they're protected from flames and branches are really\nHigh off the ground so their fire would have to be huge to torch is its cones are covered with a thick\nOf sticky resident that holds them shut\nSo they can't sprout and form a new tree\nThat is until fire comes along to melt the resin\nAnd let them pop open up that way after a fire has passed and decimated all the competition pitch pines are the first to bounce back and re colonize\nA Phoenix rising from the ashes and even if you do manage to towards the trees they invest heavily in their roots storing lots of nutrients there so after a fire burns it down to a stump\nThe ... like the head of a hydro when it's chopped off by a Greek hero and that's not just true the pitch fine but\nHere like another called the scrub oak um there's apparently a guy on Cape Cod that has been doing this little like backyard experiment he's ... he's been continuously cutting every year for Thirty years and it sprouts every year yeah friends have to kill them that way it's pretty tough to kill a scribe\nOf in general I mean you'd have to come out and out here with a bulldozer and plowed them out of the ground [laughter]\nPlants\nNeed ecosystems are so deeply coal evolves the fire that they actually encourage fired [noise] blueberries eucalyptus month and he just we ferns all of these plants have developed whack seat boy Lee leads to their extra flammable\nPay a ... year most explode into play some people call them in the later this is\nPaul Daniel ... colleges who's doing a student at the U.S Army Corps of engineers this debate over why plans would evolve to be more flammable has been smoldering since Nineteen Seventy\nIt's kind of a paradox why would a plant tales Emily one idea is that is a plant can burn very hot and intensely might burn up its neighbors as well as itself\nIf you're a plant that can grow back after a fire by sprouting from your roots or by being the first to grow back because of your fire activated seen this is good news for you or at least for your genes\nEven though the individual would be would be harmed or killed in the fire its offspring would benefit from it having burned up its neighbors and and this is a hypothesis coke killed by a neighbor\nPlant as arsenic and this is a really attractive idea but\nA lot of ... just point out that flame ability could just as easily be coincidence is in fire adapted plans have evolved to survive droughts and being eaten by herbivores and grow in poor soils and all these adaptations also just happened to make them more flammable\nBut it is for real it's an example of plants doing something a lot of us think is just the domain of vertebrates their reshaping the forest engineering their environment to be more welcoming for species like them species that thrive after a fire in these plants\nThey used to run this joint we know from a bunch of different sources that before the Europeans arrived there was a lot more fire on the land and there is today\nThere's this whole spectrum of how well plants tolerate fire and generally speaking everywhere east the Mississippi seems to be sliding away from the fire tolerant end of the spectrum and that means that for like the pine Baron where we started this story used to be much more common\nSo where all these fires coming from\nAnd most of the eastern United States and and in parts of the western United States as well [noise] there or something like a anywhere from\nFour to six teen plowed to ground lightning strikes per square kilometer per year and each one of those is uh I'm told hotter than the surface of the sun\n[noise]\nThis is one version of the story but there's something else in the data to wherever there was fire there were people who started the fire maybe\nBook and\nThis is an HBO or it's eight
