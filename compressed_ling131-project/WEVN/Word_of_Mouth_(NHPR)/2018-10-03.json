can be a little little bleak sometimes for young people yeah yeah I grew up like a like mostly in New Hampshire and it's definitely a question you have\nWhen I'm when you're growing up as a teenager you know a lot of people want to like get out of where they grow up and see the world and in a place like New Hampshire I think that leads to a bigger question of like oh is this a problem yeah and but I also people feeling torn about it like loving New Hampshire or loving living in northern New England\nBut for a bunch of different reasons but which we're going to hear about real estate feeling conflicted about whether or not they can stay yeah sure there are a lot of parallels to New Hampshire and brave little state of the really great job reporting the story so we're excited to have it on the show today well if you're\n\nEver since we started this show there's a question we've gotten a lot\nI'm reading a show many young people leading many young people leaving for\nLike a lot of what I Do wonder what it is that keeping people from going back\nI wondered why some people have left what drew them out what drew them back for those that do come back people come at this question from all directions\nI think it makes me feel bad and I think they feel guilty\nEmily ... is one of the departed so to speak right now she lives in DC\nSad that one that was guilty that I feel like I contributing to the problem\nDiane McGarry is a Vermont and mom just hoping her kids will move home\nOh I Would love it if they were [laughter] probably another reason why I asked the question\nAnd

people\nHistorically that's definitely true that we felt second best\nNow whether use flight is an existential concern\nOr something that you can just barely see in the numbers there is a Vermont town

want to raise their family there\nSo they spent a bunch of time online researching possibility\nAnd just kind of get an overview of fled the scene scene was sitting on a computer we looked like everywhere we went to Oklahoma and Kansas everywhere New York\nThey wanted something low key with more personalized teaching in the schools and they eventually chose Vermont\nNever really found like a solid job leave [noise]\nSo we were just kind of just pack up and go whatever we don't want to be here let's just go to\nWho's thirty three ended up making them move without her husband last April he

northeast kingdom it's about twenty minutes from St john's berry and forty five for ... years but there aren't any main roads passing through it it's a town people say that one has to decide to go to and when Rachel got there she wanted to stay\nThe appeal is it just sounds easy [noise]\nIt's a small this is slow paved roads that goes through the middle of things like that mattered to me no matter to me now and that in my life\nAnd there was a school so it just work\nNow there are a lot of towns in Vermont with a small school and a paved road running through the middle but I can see why Rachel is drawn to teach them it is over the top charming\nThe village has a cozy cafe and white people church next to a big red barn with youth of the White Mountains\nIt was snowing big flakes on the day I visited and I felt like I stepped into an Instagram it's kind of place\nWhere when you said of an interview with the town clerk's invites you on a horse drawn sleigh ride along by a gentle Belgian draft horse named keeps the\nWhole board Peter I'm so there's the village kind of what kind of looking down over the town the cafe church the barn\nThomas gallon at isn't just a town clerk he's also the town treasure\nAnd like Rachel he's in his thirties relatively new to town and a parent of to get his white Hannah moved here in twenty Thirteen\nAnd then out this way as a series of hillsides would scattered farms throughout I'm like you could imagine in Norman Rockwell painted\nNorman Rockwell would have appreciated the fact that Tom built this lead at an old book shelves from the peach in libraries and he's probably appreciate Tom college one piece the horse breaks into a gallon\n[laughter] [noise] you're bored or [noise]\nToms extended family has a long history and teach 'em farming among other things and Tom down to two days for the town with similar work\nReally fortunate to have a town of flexible to understand paying and triggering and all the pieces that come with that you know when the cows get out here in our late for work people are more interested to see that they got in rather than where were you in that's British very fortunate for that\nTown echoed that sentiment that I heard so many times that people come to teach him do so very deliberately\nWe're here for a lifestyle we're here for a community um seldom do people move here because of a job\nBecause they're they're they're craving monitoring fusion has offered\nTo be clear there are some things ... does not offer like reliable cell service and a grocery store and it can be hard to find housing if you don't have a family connection or the right timing but\nTom and Rachel are among a solid crop of thirty some things that have chosen peach and in recent years and they had all sorts of reasons for coming here we're coming back\nI mean the moon was out it was you know lighting the town and the love the landscape and as we were pulling into um teach them it's sort of like one of those like\n... like a moment's um then I said this is the town I'm going to limit\nIts Food at one time I don't know if that's still true the most\nThe state of Vermont and I just want to I think a lot of people outside of their imagined Vermont to BYU\nAnd I have always lived in large cities larger towns this is the first time I've actually lived in a small town and I have to say really love\nIt here [noise] we had to have cell service and we either have broadband Internet from my wife to work from home\nWe have five large dog and we don't like having next door neighbors\nWhen I was twenty Twenty one I wanted to get pretty good and gone\nAnd I did a metronome I guess that makes the heart grow fonder there was a\nWoman in town who just pass to have the same birthday as\nMy oldest son and so and his birthday he would pick apples and make apple sauce and bring it to her for her birthday and she was a hundred and one and that kind of connection and I think doesn't happen elsewhere\nAnd someone will Bush Hog your yard if you needed it sort of the borrow share um community spirit that makes this place so lovely\nTo live we ended up by my grandparents' house here so that was kind of a decision maker but we did like Pete jumped just for school choice\nSo school choice in peach and this means that after six grade parents can choose to send their kids to the private St john's very academy or the public Danville high school or the independent Lyndon Institute or others\nThat and the quality of the peach in elementary school were part of basically everyone's decision to leave here\nMy wife and I chose peach I'm I'm largely in part because\nIt was a local small elementary school my motivation was checking schools the educational opportunities that we wanted for our son\nIs the ability to choose a high school for children to go to\nRachel my guess says it's like a parents' dream\nI remember telling the principle of actually gray would I moved here this is

enrollment in the elementary school is at thirty five percent since two thousand twelve\nWhich is kind of remarkable given that most Vermont schools are watching their numbers tick down\nWe had had a preschool teacher in order to accept more kids because we were at capacity so trend lines seems to be going up and um I I don't think that the school climate could be any better make\nHis age thirty
