P. R. I'm Justine paradise here with then Henry before the break we heard the story of police departments trying out Internet humor it started with the Facebook joke about police seizure of illegals hot\nPlant in Marlboro New Hampshire and then waited into this summer's trend of police lip sync videos cops go online sometimes they make jokes but social media can be treacherous for anyone\nWho is there any guidance or training for cops on the Internet so I'm Lauri Stevens and I am the principal is lost communications\nLauri Stevens does social media training for cops and she runs a smile conference social media and Internet for law enforcement which will be held for the sixteenth time next spring the conference include seminars on communications NPR investigation and legal issues\nAnd if there were major events like a hurricane or mass shooting the review how departments handle\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members on from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked ... in your community was convenient locations throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think it was at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock whose here these\nStudents as well some departments were early adopters of social media others were more resistant\nRight like if you're a police department why do you need to be on Twitter to do your job right\nBut she says it was actually events like officer Darren Wilson fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri events like that where a huge wake up call for them\nWell as you recall or may not recall but that was a you know the black where the whole started the black lives matter movement hands up don't shoot and we find out ten months later in the hands up don't shoot never happened it was just made up in social media\nSo this hands up don't shoot saying it's important to understand what Laurie is talking about here\nAfter Michael Brown was shot the story that police shot him even though he'd surrendered with hands in the year that story became a rallying cry a symbol for why police needed to be held to account\nBut after the protests the department of justice investigated and found that there was not evidence to support that narrative the Michael Brown had his hands up when he was shot\nYou can imagine if someone took issue with the black lives matter movement you might see this is an indication that the police did nothing wrong but the hands up don't shoot debate misses a bigger take away from a different department of justice report investigating Ferguson\nThe investigation frowned as systemic violations against African Americans in quote nearly every aspect of Ferguson's law enforcement system\nSo protesters have police misconduct did not go away the focus on my hands up story might miss the point and meanwhile black lives matter resonated with people across the country\nIn the black lives matter movement was born on Twitter these activists were very adept at social media\nAnd it and it just took off and it took control away from the police and\nI I think that what they learned from that is even though you know in tiny Ferguson, Missouri maybe they were thinking we really don't need this stuff and it doesn't matter how small you are no matter how large you are you need to be out there using it both for um you really need it and building relationships and earning the trust of the community that Easter\nSo that when you need them you the community members and when you need to be getting out messages to try to control the story\nAnd I always hesitate to use that word control but you know really um steer the story rather you know ... you can't do that if you're not out there already using it\nSo thinking back here to the twenty first century policing task force from twenty Fifteen\nIf the department of justice recommends using social media as a tool for building relationships access on trust\nCan law enforcement agencies also use it to control or steer the story or those schools at odds so there are legal issues when it comes to police social media accounts on an off duty use freedom of speech whether it counts as a public forum or not\nSo Stevens says agencies need to clear policy she's a template for her policy on our website that tries to address some of those legal questions but what about humor\nWhat I tell the people who take my training when it comes to humor as he was a good thing it can really you know soften that relationship between police department and its audience but you gotta make sure you're funny first I'm eighty don't want to overdo it but the other thing is that what flies in one town isn't necessarily going to work\nEven in the very next town and so I I I never stand before my my students and say don't do this ever or do you this always it really has to be decided in house\nAnd in Marlboro the person who decides what's\n... sergeant by him do did anyone take issue with the use\nOf humor at all like to do some people think that it's not appropriate for police\nSo I think there are very few\nUm in obviously doesn't it doesn't change the way that that we do things because there's always going to be\nPeople who are are against what you do in general um there there are a few people who I think you're kinda stuck in the old way of they like their their\nPolice to let them know through some sort of major incident but otherwise you know just kind of do their jobs and be quiet about it but um I think\nThose those people sometimes take issue with the the positive attention that we get I think and um you know that that marijuana posts obviously got way more attention than it probably um that I think it probably deserved\nA lot of the criticism in the comments to the marijuana post came from people who thought we should be legal so why are police spending time confiscating plants that again by um says the police don't get to decide which laws they enforce or not and he says he does not moderate those comments that he wants the Facebook page to be a two way dialogue\nYou know every every once in a while when when people are I'm getting a little overboard on stuff like that I Do like to respond in a in a more light hearted\nWay just to kind of sometimes of diffuses people a little bit to see that we're not the the big bad guy that they have painted in their their mind sometimes so\nSurgeon by him says that he tries to be tasteful and where he uses humor for instance an accident or arrest or when someone's really suffering he won't do it\nI think it's a little um it's not tasteful probably to try to make light of something that you know people might be suffering through\nBut this isn't always consistent for instance by um sometimes post photos of people who don't turn up to court when he's looking for them and when you go to the Marlboro police Facebook feed you'll come across this other post they got a lot of attention the first line says it's miss connections Monday\nIn that one was just a a creative post kind of written in a style of a missile connections ad\nHe's talking about one of those missed connections ad on Craig's list so I'll just read what the post says\nIt was a warm April evening you drove a panic for I was wearing my favorite blue polyester suits neither of us knew at that particular moment but fate or poor driving would soon bring us to meet for the first\nTime I know you're not supposed to dissect jokes but I'm going to do it any way the joke here is that the blue polyester suits is by a police uniform and the joke is that uh Craig's list miss connections post is usually the suggestion is usually the motivations romantic but here by him as writing about somebody that he arrested\nSo the Facebook posts continues so blowing through a stop sign and not using your turn signal gave me a great excuse to strike up a conversation the perfect icebreaker\nRight and it goes on for a while it's kind of a long posed this person didn't show up in a court date by him trying to find her and it picks up again banking you can you read the rest\nIf you're reading this and you aren't my midst connection you can still help me get this old worn off my desk hits share and be part of something big do it to get me that much closer to the deluxe squeeze in art for slice toaster oven I'm only three arrests away from winning it stainless steel people\nRight that's the end of the post so\nThis this one also went viral ten thousand shares and it made headlines\nAgain it had the picture of the woman in the post the king sentinel quoted Alex Parsons the managing attorney at the New Hampshire public defender's office in Keene Parsons wrote quote to be made the brunt of the public joke by an authority figure it's unlikely to engender respect in any one\nIn Chester county according to data provided by the department of corrections\nIt's a little lower there than the state average for black people are still four times as likely to be jailed than white people so it was it really too much to ask a police officer to things like a social worker I think I Know what Richard been look there would say\nThis isn't the kind of thing where you apply get a job and punch in a punk show it's a discipline academic it's one that requires continual daily gross and when you cute Brody more when you can't nobody more need to leave\nIf we want to change that perception if we want to be perceived differently than we need to do business there\nThat's Chris Burbank again from the center for policing equity or the C. P. E.\nAcross the nation we are engaged in similar to weaken the producers similar outcomes we know this for a fact right who was incarcerated in this country who's held accountable there isn't a fair system in place\nAnd more people of color are held accountable or held more severely accountable for the exact same behavior\nAnd I don't care where you are in the country that's that's the case\nAnd again if we want to change let's really change it I always wanted police officers and myself to be viewed as human right we have human frailties we have emotions we have sadness we have happy times right we have drug and alcohol\nAddiction just like everybody else we are you must be wrong but we officers club microcosm of society\nSo we have all this was in [noise] but then what we ask you to do as a police officer what you represent to rise above all down in certain circumstances and even that much more sensitive caring empathetic and understand\nBurbank says that the best side of policing\nBut a real change will require a lot more\nThan just thinking [noise]\n\nAfter the break how did the comic book character become a symbol of police pride that's coming up and word of mouth stay with us [noise]\n\n\n\nAn HP ours campaign for innovation has helped make possible exciting new content\nFor and about in Hampshire like outside in our ... cats that enhanced his or her love\nThe

to the show we're continuing our episode today about police culture and how we perceive the police producer Ben Henry takes it from here\nSo it was Saturday Night it was really late one or Frank a Jew juniors friends got invited to a party at someone's house so they all went inside the house did you got a bad vibe\nThat house belong to Andrew spaniel or who at the time was an officer of the Milwaukee police department most of the other people at the party were off duty cops and also white\nDude was one of the only people of color there\nHe and his friends decided just to leave\nBut a group of police officers followed them out of the house and surrounded their car\nAccording to ... lawyers here's what happened next the costs accused him of stealing a police badge and then threw him to the ground they never found a stolen badge and his pockets or any other stolen items while he was down on the ground they cut his clothes off and then beat him and\nHe ended up with a concussion broken bones and cuts all over his\nBody was unrecognizable\nAccording to court filings an internal department report at least one of the officers yelled a racial slur at him\nAnd hear the detail that stays with you the gym to Penn into both of his years until the blood flow is what's happening is friends called nine one one the dispatcher sent police to break it up [noise]\nOne unsettling detail about Frank juniors case that his lawyers decided to leave out of their civil rights lawsuit later on\nOr rumor had been going around the Milwaukee police department about an underground police game it's not totally clear what the gang supposedly did what is clear is that their logo was a ...\nIt's got these elongated gripping teeth and ... eyes you've probably seen it before it's the logo for the punish her a comic book hero most recently seen in a gritty Netflix drama his whole thing is he hunts down and murders people who deserve it\nThat was the mascot is rumored police game called themselves the punishment [noise]\nThat case in Milwaukee it's an extreme example\nBut the thing is the punishment has attracted a following among law enforcement and the military\nOne police department in Kentucky went so far as the paint the skull under police cruisers the lake Chris Kyle who the film American Sniper is based on wrote in his memoir that his unit in the military named themselves to punish yours and spray painted the skull everywhere\nYou also to see the ... right alongside for example the blue lives matter flag but don't tread on me flag and that kind of thing it's been appropriated into the universe of vaguely right wing pro police kinda macho symbolism [noise] so what are we looking at here is this a big deal\nIs the punishment crypto fascist for just one more comic book removed and a culture already saturated with violence [noise]\nLike every comic book character this guy has an origin story yeah let's talk about that so so the original punish her character what exactly was his background\nIn the late sixties early seventies they talked about the credibility gap which was the gap that particularly in reference to Vietnam between what the government said was happening and what news reporters were able to establish was actually happening\nThis is Gerry Conway he's talking about the national mood for decades ago when he invented the punish or\nAnd then on top of that you had a the collapse of institutions or the levels of crime in the early Nineteen seventies were were phenomenal and it seemed like there was no no way for government to you know effectively respond to those social needs\nSuddenly vigilantism wasn't just a back alley short cut to justice maybe it was the only route to justice\nThat's where I thought the character was interesting because he presents one responds to you know societal failure\nSo the punishment is a military vet originally he fought in the Vietnam War whose family was killed by criminals so he becomes a vigilante to get revenge know superpowers know gadgets just extravagant violence\nOriginally he was a villain and not even an important one Gerry Conway was a writer for the amazing Spider Man and he just needed a bad guy for one or two issues\nThen at some point the invisible hand of American Pop culture turn to punish or into something else can you introduce yourself\nSure my name is Abraham re spend and I'm a staff writer at New York magazine and its culture website vulture\nAbraham wrote about the punishment when the Netflix series came out I asked him when did this association between the police and the punish her began\nAround the period when the war on terror really kicked in\nWe're talking post nine eleven the war in Afghanistan it's one of the most popular TV shows is twenty four main which Jack Bauer goes around torturing terrorists\nAnd you saw mass mobilization of American military force abroad but also the increasing militarization of domestic law enforcement you started to see the punishment logo show up in other contexts uh specifically with cops and soldiers this is uh\nStarted calling themselves the punish hours it's worth noting that the original punish or the one Gerry Conway came up with he was always meant as a rebuke of access violence his story line exposed the one big obvious law of vigilante justice",
