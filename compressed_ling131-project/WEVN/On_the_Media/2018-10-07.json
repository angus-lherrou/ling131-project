this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted sevens cavalry stopped spotted outspend sue as well as some other allied bands

protect our civilization\nFollow it up with one more wrong and white these on pained and came up all creatures from the face of the earth\nBy virtue of being wrong to run our threat almost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceeding four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically\nThe end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the massacre they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre when Geneva where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation the leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from\nAnd my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal suffers\nYou know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them that's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just\nA story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate missed the point\nWhen did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live\nFully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if this is a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared at Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby off the following treated real purchase ... for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of tune from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\n'cause we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with a FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington ... ... the trail of broken treaties\nThe care of and was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who is one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey want to the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing and timber in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the ... trashed the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ...\nThen agreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or ... it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was that take over in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the current is that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise] times come\nViolence who might have to be committed [noise] there'd\nBeen a number of very high profile murders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places and South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm\nAnd people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or misdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd sell for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise]\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it\nI did a massive it showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government of Pine Ridge was very against this big Wilson the German uh Pine Ridge was interested mostly in staying in power\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it\nPlenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas but also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's a story of surplus [noise] that's
