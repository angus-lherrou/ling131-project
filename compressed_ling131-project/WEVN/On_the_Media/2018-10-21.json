response was probably not what Warren had anticipated she came out and thought she scored at first and showed us the media\nAnd it sort of the men and Donald Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are used to the DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nFrom both the right and left appropriate accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms\nThat she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity Barney fights\nA political miscalculation but also a stone into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere is a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when

resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is uh\nStandings of kinship and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry we have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe know in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is lineage and said\nHave given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you are looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors the ... to the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their ... these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how traveling romances govern what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the bass world you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds\nYeah when you see on the back of my traveling Roman card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and around the whole blood quote unquote\nIs my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who is your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly Thirteen thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native\nNow if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one

encourage contact but nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of his adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of their background I think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I find that\nBecause being a twin is very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like not says twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who'd spent a year in space while a

know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia or multiple sclerosis or diabetes it expected the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's closer to forty fifty percent something has to trigger the X\nThe other an identical twins where to part or identical twins who different some white and help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and managed disease\n[noise] you've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history is of two sets identical male twins who are born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city\nAnd the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of those little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as he had the twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange was one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to a Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade\nBut I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life history is amazing the one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary\n[noise] so what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small sample I Know\nBut yes but it's a very dramatic case and so we told me a couple of things in terms of the abilities one could certainly see that not having access to education left in indelible stamp on those twins but I Will say that one of the twins who was raised in the small town who should have been raised in Bogota", "show_name": "On the Media", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "21"}
