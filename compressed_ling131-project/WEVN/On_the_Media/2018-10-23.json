genetics professor who examine to DNA\nAnd the hunger genome we did find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence taxes yeah we have a Native American ancestry and you're better\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated\nShe came out and thought she scored at first and soda the media and it sort of the men Donald Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are used to the DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nFrom both the right and left appropriate

tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is\nI don't mean to sound cliche but everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not governed so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is lineage and fate have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related to either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors but does a lot ... at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their can these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base real you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds\nYeah when you see on the back of my traveling rolling card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and around the whole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there\nIt's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who is your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base Rome\nThat you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient they will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native\nNow my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservations should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to money\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards lineage will defend rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power words severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore [noise]\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women and this is something ... she got some set in the New Yorker you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his ... you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma and the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this myth of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family's story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nRight but but for for non native people who have a set their colonial idea of kinship ancestry and family finding that genetic proof is important to them\nDeeply racialized no one is making fine distinctions in the workplace\nAnd the housing market between forms of African ethnicity or whether or not someone is deemed to be just black or white and what those racial identities experience as they are entitled people to you or don't entitle people too in the world\nAlondra thank you very much it's a pleasure to speak with uber Alondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council professor of sociology at Columbia University and author of the social life of\nDNA race reparations and reconciliation\nAfter that you know [noise]\nApplication of genetic research and another kind of controversy twins disease on [noise] on the\nMedia is supported by target preventing future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future at heart\nAvailable on apple pie cas or wherever pond caster found\nThis is an age PR it's a forty two [noise]\nHi I'm Laura canoe I hosted the exchange joined me as I sit down with the incoming governor Crist's the noon and we really\nGoing to say why believe in lower energy rate jobs will be support that reason and\nChallenger Molly Kelly have a right to be with the people we care the most about when they needed to discuss where they stand on the issues important to New Hampshire voters this special broadcast\nThe exchange will be on October twenty fourth at seven PM live from Manchester community college register for your free tickets at an H.

New power to examine how three distinct parenting styles might shape identical triplets reared apart\nNot until the boys met by chance that age Nineteen did they learn how their lives have been manipulated for a trove of data that remains largely locked away in an archive at Yale\nAccording to Dr Nancy ... the director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unreal these study would likely inconclusive and definitely cruel\nWell I I think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times\nThe practice was that you don't encourage contact but nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of his adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of their background I think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I did\nBecause being a twin is very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like not says twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who'd spent a year in space while a twin lived on earth the me had a few things with this Scott\nKelly and Mark Kelly are the only identical twin astronaut in history but following DNA altering space mission they may not be identical anymore\nOr you were in phase had already made got two inches taller than his brother study found seven percent of Scott's James\nOrange on two years ago so they're no longer identical twins that space travel altered\nGenetic expression it did not old and the DNA physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out\nI think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's close to the forty fifty percent something has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other end identical twins where it apart or identical twins who are different in some way\nAnd help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and managed disease\n[noise] you've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history as of two sets identical male twins who were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city\nAnd the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as he got the twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange was one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota and somebody confused a twin and one pair for ... and the other\nI went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade\nBut I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life history is amazing the one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary\n[noise] so what it does tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small sample I Know\nBut yes but it's a very dramatic case and so we told me a couple of things in terms of the abilities one could certainly see that not having access to education left an indelible stamp on those twins but I Will say that one of the twins who was raised in the small town who should have been raised in Bogota", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the Media", "city": "Keene", "day": "23"}
