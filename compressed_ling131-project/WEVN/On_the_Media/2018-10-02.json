hearings proceeded with urgency to the sound of a stop watch that only the G O P could hear ticking down down down [noise]\nI mean obviously this was in eleventh hour ambushed by the Democrats will be a lot of the hour we're committed votes on schedule\nAnd frankly we've reached a point where it's time to end the circus\nMake that three allegations all of which have brought added intensity to the process the proceedings be delayed until the allegations are they not why not why not delay for ten days or ten weeks or however long it would take for say mark judge to come out of hiding\nAfter Antonin Scalia died we lived with an eight members Supreme Court for fourteen months\nBecause then the Senate Republicans insisted on patients\nWere not going to move or even discuss the qualifications of any nominee until after the first actual election\nObviously in this case the clock is set to hit zero on November six when the Democrats have a reasonable shot at taking over the Senate and making it even tougher for a Trump nominee to the high court\nIndeed the Republican holding the Congress is so slight the president seems to be laying the groundwork for accusations of illegitimacy if the Democrats take a house or to by suggesting on Wednesday that China plans to buddy and\nThey do not want me for us to win because I Am the first president ever to challenge China on trade\nBut we don't need China or Russia to throw sand in the gas tank of democracy because\nWe're doing that ourselves systematically and increasingly for more than a century and we've been doing it\nBy keeping people from voting\nThis past summer the Brennan Center for justice released a new report on voter purges it documented sixteen million voters removed from the rolls between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen almost four million more than were removed between two thousand and six and two thousand and eight\nAnd the areas with the most dramatic calling exactly the regents that until twenty Thirteen were so historically unfair to eligible black voters that the voting rights act subjected them to pre clearance from the Justice Department\nPre cleared means that any changes that that state or that county we're going to make in their voting laws had to be okayed by the U.S department of justice or the federal court before that change was made\nCarol Anderson is a professor of history at Emory University and author of one person no vote a voter suppression is destroying our democracy she says that the previous law the Nineteen fifty seven civil rights act had been insufficient\nVoters in the south by the time that the u._s. was fighting the Nazis only three percent of African American adults were registered to vote in the south\nThe state's implemented new laws new purchases and the civil rights act couldn't deal with it the voting rights act could because of pre clearance because the states could not\nImplement a law then run elections based on just franchise meant have politicians who had been elected because of ... who are crafting new disc franchising laws the voting rights act really short circuit that\nThese jurisdictions had been caught red handed and were required to pass federal muster for enforcing any of these rules intended to suppress the vote which they claimed was an onerous burden and by the twenty first century no longer necessary\nBecause they cleaned up their act and in Shelby County versus holder the Supreme Court agreed with\nThe county commissioners and Shelby County Alabama and be gone and accessing vast parcels of land around Calera city\nAll of this without getting pre cleared by the department of justice so they're violating federal law there had been one lone black city councilman in ... city\nThe lone black councilman moved from a district where he was going to get elected to a district where over Seventy percent of the residents had voted against Iraq Obama\nIn the next election after all of this redistricting Calera city no longer even had one black councilman\nAnd the Justice Department sued Shelby County saying it was in violation of the pre clearance requirements and the voting rights act\nAnd the U.S Supreme Court with chief justice John Roberts writing an opinion of four or five four decision\nSaid that one racism was no longer the kind of prevalent force that it had been that gave rise to the need for the voting rights act he pointed to black elected officials Hispanic elected officials the\nIncrease in black voter turnout and he said so it's clear that racism is just not operating in the United states at least not at that kind of high level and he said that the voting rights act didn't take into account the changing dynamics of America\nLet's just say that the Roberts five four majority was the case of premature recalculate ... above the level of racism in the electoral process\nComes now the burning numbers which shows that the voter purges suppressing the black vote is highest in precisely the places where the court decision let the stress doctrines off the hook\nIn other words they went right back to their former practices\nHit it head on we had every indication of this we had Alabama in two thousand and eleven that passed voter id law now when Alabama was working on this law\nThe Republicans recorded themselves talking and they said we need to figure out how to depress the black voter turnout\nAnd then all of the racism pours out you're going to have all of these aborigines and leaves illiterates getting on these hut finance buses and going to the polls\nAnd so they crafted the voter ID laws targeted at African Americans to depress the vote but that was in two thousand eleven before Shelby County beholder\nImmediately after Shelby County beholder boom Alabama begins to implement that law the same with Texas and so these states we're just poised they had these laws drafted ready\nWas a key piece of it here in Georgia our secretary of state Brian Kemp who's now running for governor has a program called exact match what exact match does is it says that your voter registration card\nHas to exactly match what in the bureau of motor vehicles database say you have a driver's license or or from the Social Security office\nNow where that gets dicey is say that your name is hyphenated um Garcia hyphen mark his and\nYou hyphenated when you write it for your voter registration card but say on your driver's license in the driver's license database\nThere's not a hyphen they're not having a high and\nGets you kicked out of your voter registration and your voter registration is denied\nNo it's not just purchase of the voter rolls through there's many other classic tools to voter suppression I just want to make the point that this was not some sort of new development\nIt has a long sinister sordid history in Eighteen Ninety during the rise of Jim Crow the state of Mississippi was trying to figure out how do we stop black people from voting\nAnd they devised what was called the Mississippi Plan\nSuch as the poll tax where you have to pay in order to vote such as the literacy tests where you had to read sections of the constitution even the state constitution or the U.S constitution\nAnd interpreted to the liking of the registrar such as the white primary we're only whites could vote in the Democratic primary\nThe grandfather clause the good character clause that was an array of devices that created a package of disenfranchisement targeted at the black population\nThey couldn't just say we don't want black people to vote because there was this thing called the fifteenth amendment to the constitution that said that the right to vote shall not be abridged on account of race color or previous servitude\nAnd so they were trying to figure out then how do we eliminate most of the black voters if not all and still remain constitutional\nThat framing led to going after suicide only imposed characteristics on people\nAnd then making that the litmus test for access to the ballot box so poverty coming out of slavery African Americans were impoverished there was no forty acres there was no meal that kind of poverty than played into the poll tax the significant massive under funding of black schools\nWhich takes months to write and then it has to go up for public comment period which is probably another month or two and then it has to come before Congress for at least a month or so there's a long way to go and tell some clear guidelines or get in on the other side the IRS has really chosen\nTo protect the donor identity is rather than to disclose their identities and this is the way the Irish and they're moving recently because they believe that there's too much room for error that there had been leaks of donors who did not want to be disclosed\nSo the IRS has moved away from disclosure so it's really unlikely that the government agencies or not do anything and time to make a huge difference for the midterm Stanley or even in time to make a real difference next year\nAnd looks to say in some fantasy world both the federal election commission and the IRS do pass some explicit rules governing five oh one C. fours and\nA similar category fiber once the sixes if we know anything from history it's the political money adopts\nIf you're a political high roller and rules change you know you're going to find a new way to donate if you run the show yeah he leave political action committee what would be your next move\nSo if I were them Michele ... social welfare and nonprofit I as a non profit and say to a donor could you give me some money to help flip the Senate and then I Will use your money\nIn whatever way it take to get there\nSo he kept saying how it's changing the way that they're asking he's on his money they might be asking you generally support what I support as a group please give us money and then maybe they'll try to use the money for political purposes it's really unclear if that's allowed but that's one creative way that the groups might start doing it\nAnother way that the ... and I started operating is that they might give it to unaffiliated superPAC so I have and the ... the nonprofit group\nThe donation and then I make a donation to a superPAC instead\nThat way the superPAC only that's going to the non profit that gave the money and the ... a nonprofit and would not have to disclose any like donors who gave them money\nTo the nonprofit so it's actually it's adding one more layer between the identity of a donor and whatever what triggered the disclosure of that person's identity\nAlso known has money laundering\nThat that's what some critics might call it I wouldn't advise and objective reporter call it that\nIf there is a change in the uh the political donor ecosystem at what point do you think the status quo will change by\nElectric for example\nAlthough it's not officially an attack and we may not see any sort of official change in behavior within the term it's already started altering behavior of John areas\nAnd superPACs and non profit groups that I've spoken to let the donors that are those that have been aware of the possible change coming down the pike and when the lower court ruling came down in early August at actually put a lot of these groups on alert so they have been scrambling to figure out what their\nBill council what this means for their fundraising for twenty eight ... what they should be telling that John or how they can\nChange the script for asking for donations and donors are already asking about what does it mean for me how early can my identity disclosed to the public that's actually changed a lot of behaviors already\nLet me ask you one less thing however this plays out it still seems to me like a surprising decision by a Roberts' court Citizens United court\nTo lead stand this lower court decision the complicated life for political donors can we divine anything about this situation beyond its particulars\nThey're very little could read and chip away to the Supreme Court reacted here because we don't know why that happened we don't know whether that's because the other justices deadlocked or for on this or whether they just wanted to go through the full appeals process\nWe just have no idea what is interesting about that certainly in the context that judge Kavanaugh's nomination is that after this case ... your appeal it could come back before the Supreme Court and\nThere is a jets if Kavanaugh who is not a fan of Donetsk earlier or campaign finance speculation it's a really make a huge impact and the ... campaign finance regulation or the sided on at the Supreme Court level so that has really interesting and ... they're
