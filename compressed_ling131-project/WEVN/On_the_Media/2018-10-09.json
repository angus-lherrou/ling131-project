be wiped away in a in a massive flood or or some kind of catastrophe\nMeaning all the white people meaning the white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nWas never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folk at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted Alex Band suit as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next

up with one more wrong and white please on ... and ... came up all creatures from the face of the year\nBy virtue of of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceeding four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the massacre they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yet deep earns Nineteen Seventy classic vary by heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pitches the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety I ...\nWounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found during my hard at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas when to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal suffers\nYou know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just\nDifferent facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate missed the point\nWhen did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults in our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live\nFully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns book came out describe what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians in to the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with a Caucasian and happens this land nearby off the following treated real purchase ... for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doom from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nAs we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI isn't right [noise] they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nThe curve and was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nSupport for an HBO ... comes

you think\nIs at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more starting with Hitchcock is here\nTimber and mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it but then the people who are in the ... the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of Nixon's guys back man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat is right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time this current is that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise] times come [noise] violence who might have to be committed [noise] there'd\nBeen a number of very high profile murder of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm\nAnd people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or misdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd sell for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded me was under siege\n[noise]\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it\nI did aim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government of Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German uh Pine Ridge was interested mostly in staying in power\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank\nYou so much I'm really speaking out to be on the show\nDavid Dreier is a chip away from the leech lake

hilarious at first it was in a tweet by me one of the local branches of a sudden ... the alternative for Germany\nThe tweet showed the photograph of sitting bull it said the Indians couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful and it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six that was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation an election campaigns of many European right wing party in Austria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you'll find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front and there's even a term for this phenomenon Indians who was the ...\nAnd you say that India and the things he adds them and German nationalism actually share similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either\nUnder military occupation or had been forced to become allies off Napoleon so nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation miss\nThe French have joann of arc the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that ... one of the very few sources do cry these tribes as honest loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as decadent and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen ... early Nineteen century French philosopher Jones or Corso used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament what's akin to that of the noble Savage\nExactly entered around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off of blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the lake nineteenth century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer that's\nRight so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous couple of characters the German immigrant and adventure old had her hand and his Apache friend written into the farthest\n[laughter] way after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen nineties\nHe claims that he based old shot her hand on himself selling named because he could not get fall is out with one explosive punch\nApache teeth and then to see to me the really popular among the German public right yes\nHe is in an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter]\nShe's always out there by himself looking for white people he can help\nAnd Carl my made him ... enough to fit into the frame of the adventure\nBut as some scholars described it to you also seems to be a very good German [laughter] because he has his character trait that their German bourgeoisie or supposed to strive towards like honesty\nBravery industry is nests\nThese novels had a very long life what's Hitler\nYet it is that that late in the

officers you with your ... warfare on the Eastern Front that vintage who was the ideal company commander body wasn't why\n[laughter] there were those people who said German children should only be confronted with area and heroes\nHowever Hitler was a fan and also pragmatist said it would cost too much effort to try to suppress German India enthusiasm why not harness it and profit from it\nPeople like you know how we take a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym fits ... said presenting Indian novels to German children teaches them about leadership and military training and racial
