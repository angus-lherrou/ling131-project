to just saying it's in the New Hampshire\nWith four hundred state rep seats it seemed like there are a lot of opportunities for young people like with a year to get involved but that's not the case\nIn New Hampshire we like to say we have a citizen legislature and we do\nBut it's a very select citizen legislature when you only get paid a hundred dollars the server two hundred dollars a term deserve\nThat ... he's the president of the New Hampshire young Democrats he says it's a challenge to get people with young families or less flexible job to run because of the time commitment they have to make\nAnd how little they get paid but this election year both parties are trying to overcome those obstacles and get folks under the age of forty in the legislature Democrats are feeling fifty two of those candidates and Republicans forty seven\nIt was it was tough to be a young representative when there wasn't really any um there wasn't a network of other young represents the band

when it came to topics like student debt or bills addressing first time homebuyers\nMost legislators didn't fully understand how things have really changed for people in their twenties and thirties\nI think being a Twenty one year old or twenty two year old and two dozen Eighteen\nUm it was very different if you had that experience back in Nineteen eighty um I think the outlooks different I think we know that we have student loan debt that nobody else can really compared to um I Know I have about eighty thousand dollars in student loan debt after my undergrad and my master's degree but I just think at the end of the day that representation matters\nOne candidate Sweeney hopes gets a chance this November is Virginia dry she's the youngest candidate running for office in New Hampshire and Nineteen and Republican and a woman and I want to represent that in Hungary\nJak graduated from high school last year now she's working part time job and she'll start on line classes in January\nOne

as a political a parliamentary procedure and that's why I decided that I can get this email life\nSofter doing math she decided the earliest she could pass bills in real life would be Nineteen\nBut the fact that Dr staying in New Hampshire makes her a bit unusual among her friends and number have gone out of state for college what they want to do is just not in the state keeping young people in New Hampshire has been a central concern among business leaders politicians schools and community leaders\nIt's a big issue to tackle drag knowledge is but she says instead of just focusing on getting

Environmental Defense faster began by telling us why this truth and reconciliation commission was convened\nStill the truth commission was an attempt to bring some healing to the issue of forced removal of native children from our communities native children were removed at a higher rate than other children\nThrough child welfare programs and policies and even though this law was passed in Seventy eight to mitigate that\nMain still had one of the highest rates removal\nSo in Nineteen Ninety nine we get together\nTo see what we can do about helping caseworkers comply with the law and in two thousand eight decided to embark on this process\nFor three purposes truth healing and change the truth comes in people sharing this story that truth telling process of given your story and giving voice to what has happened to you whether you were a child in foster care whether you lost your children to foster care whether you were a case worker that two children away everybody has a story to share\nIn that healing came in that truth telling process\nAnd the third goal of the commission was change and that came in their reports that they released in June twenty Fifteen\nFor people outside the native community this story of children being taken from their homes at this much much higher rate is something that is\nProbably a shock or surprise but I can imagine Maria this is not a shocker surprised within your community can you tell us about the need for the work that the commission was doing given the fact that us just laid out there about what's happened\nI think we needed to look at how did we get into the position that we were in whereby children are being removed from their homes at this rate and that people were really aware that the history was invisible that are issues and our situations\nYou may have seen the headlines this week about high mortality rates of moose cabs in our region a study published\nIn the Canadian journals zoology reported that ... percent of moose kept deaths from twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen were related to ticks\nWe spoke with Christine runs in the spring of twenty Seventeen she's a wildlife biologist with the New Hampshire fishing game department runs is leading a four year study to learn more about how weather changes enforced management practices affect the moose population she told us why ... susceptible to tick infestations what ticks are due to the animals\nMove did not evolve with actor parasites they evolved far to the north where it's cold and long winters so they're not very good at grooming\nSo when the ticks get on them they all pretty much survive move don't groom until the itching becomes a problem and by then it's too late they will have thousands of tax on them [noise]\nSo in the presence of moose and as moose densities increase [noise]\nSo do the tax the other thing that helps tax is shorter winters\nSo when our snow does not come until late December which has been happening much more frequently the ticks will be able to get on moves from when they start questioning in September until you get permanent snow fall [noise]\nAnd so what's happening is our winters have shortened by three weeks\nI'm In the last Thirty years and at the same time move densities have increased and we've basically set the stage for lots of tax which has caused moves to decline we've looked for all kinds of possible diseases\nIt's very rare to find anything wrong with you\nThe severe anemia and protein deficit caused by literally thousands of tax upwards of Ninety six thousand Turks have been counted on our moose so\nThey they literally suck these caps dry and at a time of year when nutrition isn't exactly great so\nWe call April the months of death here because come April they have simply run out of protein in their bodies they cannot replace their blood volume and they ... the calves and occasionally adults start to die\nYou can find a link to our full conversation was Christine on next New England dot org fall in New England means whether that can change fast a day that seems perfect for a hike\nYou can quickly turn dangerous nobody pays more attention to this is an author Randy minute Torre who's written desk on could taught and then other misadventures in means Baxter said park she's also the author of death on Mount Washington\nShe wanted to say about the dangers of hiking in New England and told us what to do to stay safe Randy welcome to next\nThanks for having me now your book death on on the till the events leading up to many of the sixty four deaths that have been recorded there since Nineteen thirty three in the park maybe you could start by telling us the story one of the stories that stands out to you the most about the people who perished while hiking there\nWell you know there's a story about four young men\nWho went up the mountain together who were climbing\nOr they started out on a warm fall day and suddenly it turned into a tremendous blizzard the kind of lifted that he's the one thing maybe Twenty years when temperatures fell into beyond the single digits down into the negative digits and these\nPoor guys were stuck on the side of the mountain on a ledge all night in this crazy weather and remarkably most of them got out only one of them died\nHe just you know sadly hypothermia got him\nBut the others and manage to find their way out the end of the scariest thing was no one was looking for them\nBecause people assumed that they had made it back or that they were camping somewhere on the mountain and that they were All right so no one was that there was no no wonderful main search and rescue team out looking for them and they staggered back pounded on the rangers door and that's how they got out alive\nOr one of the stories though do deal with the the rescue operations the very difficult situations that people have to put themselves in in order to to help people who have been stuck on the mountain and you write about the death of ranger Ralph ... this was some time ago but this is a this is an important story tells about Ralphie\nThe saddest stories are the ones where a ranger are rescue person loses their life trying to save somebody else's\nRalph have happened to be the ranger on duty a chimney pond when the woman hiking with Margaret ... who was stuck on the mountain that Helen Mahler came back and told the ranger that she's stuck on the mountain she can't\nCan't get down she tried taking a short cut and there are no short cuts down from ... you really have to stay on the trail so the ranger couldn't sleep knowing that there was somebody stuck up there and the weather had changed this is the curse up\nThere that the weather can change on a dime and ah he went up looking for her and she found her and actually made or as comfortable as he could but then he himself that stuck on the mountain and died of hypothermia and sadly so did Margaret sick\nThese stories are important because every time someone goes out hiking me\nI'm when the weather is changeable there is there real possibility that a a search and rescue operation could turn to leave for the people who who are conducting that search that's a really important message to get across\nThat absolutely is and I hope that and these folks I Am getting that across that these people risk their lives to bring somebody else out of the wilderness in some cases you know someone has an accident but some people do go out into the wilderness not paying attention to weather reports\nNot being what liquid and you know these people go out and risk their lives and every once in a while one of them doesn't make it back and it's it's a heartbreaking situation when that happened\nMaybe you can talk broadly about how hiking in New England might be different than in national parks elsewhere in the country because we don't have the highest peaks necessarily we don't have the hottest temperatures but we do have some very specific climate conditions here what's different between New England parks and and the rest of the country\nWell you know as you say people people come to New England to hike expecting a milder experience and they're going to find a on angels landing in Zion national park or out and mount Rainier or or one one of those with a fourteen thousand foot\nMountain they think it's going to be easier and you know it isn't one of the big things is that you've got this weather coming down from the north across the ocean from the east\nSometimes up from the south all at the same time and that can create storm system that they just don't see out west so we have different kinds of hazards up here and people need to really be prepared for what they're going to find even though they're hike is only going to take them five or six thousand feet up\nThe stories of people who die in terrible circumstances like this obviously capture the imagination can you give us some sort of context though about you know what sixty some deaths over the course of\nYou know nearly a hundred years on Mount ... means given the thousands and thousands of people who I get every year I mean what's the percentage of people who really get in trouble\nYou know the percentage is so small it's almost not worth trying to compute generally it's less than one percent a year and when you look at it on ... and a hundred thousand people go to ... state park every year and maybe one\nAnd maybe not any there will not come out just five\nWill will maybe you could just leave us then with a a bit of a checklist what some advice you give to individuals who might set off on a hike of mount ... Washington especially this time of year in the fall when you might think it's beautiful to get up to the top of a mountain and see all the all the foliage what are some things you might ask people to to think about before they go\nWell you know you've really got to think about what you're carrying in terms of making sure that you have the proper amount of food with you absolutely water is very often the the thing that really gets people that they just didn't carry enough water with them and they become dehydrated and let me get a little crazy [noise]\nFood water proper clothing and bringing clothes so that you can you can add layers as you go up\nAt but even before you start up the mountain or started on and really any hike stop at the visitor center or the ranger station talk to the rangers find out what's going on there as people you know today we really rely on our cell\nPhones thinking that we are going to find out everything we need to know wherever we are but you get out in the wilderness they're selling fell service so there you are with no information and the best information you can get it's going to be from a ranger before you start out\nThe book is called death on good taught and then other misadventures in means ... state park Randy mandatory is the author she's also written about mount Washington and many other places\nYou're joining us I really appreciate it thanks so much John this is great", "show_name": "NEXT", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "26"}
