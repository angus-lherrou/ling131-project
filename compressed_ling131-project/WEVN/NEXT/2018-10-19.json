H. P.

collaboratively and its coverage of climate change and global warming [laughter]\n\nThe frightening study released last week by a un panel shows the climate change has become an even greater and more immediate threat than the already dire warnings had predicted but climate change it still doesn't rise to the top of a list of concerns\nJim that's a bit surprising considering the New England residents seem to want their elected officials to do something about it\nI'll pull this August from the ... program on climate change communication shows at about fifty six percent of Americans want their governors to do more to combat climate change and that number's a bit higher in coastal states like Maine Massachusetts Rhode Island and Connecticut\nSo our candidates talking about climate change\nWell with us now is Annie Ropeik she's a reporter for New Hampshire public radio and the New England news collaborative Andy welcome back the next Hi John also with us is Bruce Kellerman he's a reporter for WBUR you are\nEither Bruce hey greetings joined so anyway let's start with you in with the Republican governor of New Hampshire Christian new new who's up for reelection what his his record been on issues of climate change and environment\nChristian and it's taken a pretty hands off approach when it comes to climate in his first two years as governor he often will say it's more of a federal issue than a state one he has set in the past that he's not sure about\nSome of the scientific conclusions that are broadly accepted about the role of carbon emissions and climate change for example this is actually I'm taking a bit of a step back from how he talked about the issue on the campaign trail scenario is an MIT trained environmental and civil engineer he used to run a ski resorts so he has tons of firsthand experience with this issue and\nHe has played that up in the past but in the state house he has taken more of a step back and\nTaking a wait and see approach and and left it to the federal government what about his Democratic challenger Molly Kelly Kelly really towards the Democratic party line when it comes to climate change she often will bring it up the same way that scenario does for they like to sort of say the word but we don't really hear a ton of specifics from either of them\nHere's some tape of Mali Kelly answering a question about natural gas for him during the primary campaign\nClimate change touching Israel we honor that climate change is not\nSo I think that what policies we move forward on our ah she has to be on\nSo beyond that we don't hear a ton of specific from Kelly she says we need to wean off fossil fuels increase for an old development she has a few ideas for how to enact that but again doesn't go into a ton of detail for how to fund our scale ups that development\nWhat's good in Massachusetts and talk about the Republican governor there Charlie Baker how is his record been on environmental issues and climate change\nWell according to the environment illegal Massachusetts and half a dozen other environmental organizations around the state who give him a great every every year the latest greed has been a sea and he's been see all through his term of office so far and he gets a\nA couple of as he gets a nine D's for sees five ... forays on twenty seven different issues\nSo that's a pretty wide range but I I Would guess that he grades a little bit better than a lot of Republican governors around the country he's a Massachusetts Republican after all know that that's the great is probably something that's about what you can expect to tell me about that about about his place within the Republican Party\nWell he's an anomaly as you say he uh he wrote a letter to the department of energy when Trump wanted to drill offshore for gas and oil\nAnd he wrote a very stern letter to the head of the department of energy is saying no way Jose Massachusetts is is at the end of the energy roads so we have to import most of the energy that we convert it into electricity and heat\nSo you know he's cognizant of that he's been pushing big time into offshore wind you know but he takes a very regional approach to energy because we are kind of land locked in since without offshore wind ... from our energy supplies\nSo he has to look north south and east and west so he's taking a very practical pragmatic but not a very ambitious cutting edge I think this is the ... mental ... organizations here say you know he's okay he needs to be a lot older what\nAbout his Democratic opponent in the gubernatorial race\nSupport for an HP arts live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustained excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you online at or dash Reno dot com\nThe renewable portfolio standards that we have he wants to achieve fifty percent of renewable energy by twenty thirty\nHe has a you know offshore wind he's doubling down but in that sense he's he's going along with the governor who proposing another sixteen hundred megawatts he wants to eliminate constraints on solar energy their net metering caps and so on he wants to require that old buildings where it's possible to have solar\nHim he definitely opposes the expansion natural gas pipeline infrastructure not surprisingly he wants to make Massachusetts the first state in the nation to adapt carbon price you know basically a carbon tax on all fuel imports muscle fewer imports that contain carbon\nOf course the candidates are on the campaign trail are only going to talk about these issues in as much as the potential voters really wants them to or care about themselves let's actually hear a bit from Elizabeth Henry she's president of the environmental league of Massachusetts talking a little bit about what Massachusetts voters are thinking about this election season\nThey're thinking about the economy there thinking that education I think that health care but we know that across the commonwealth her about six hundred thousand people for him environment as a number one number two issue and that's a lot\nIt seems like a lot Bruce put that into context for six hundred thousand people who really care about environmental issues a lot\nIn context and there were two point two million votes cast in the last gubernatorial election here in Massachusetts and bigger one by just forty thousand votes so you could say that's a lot but you know in terms of that list of going down and what's the importance of the electorate here in Massachusetts\nIt's issue number five maybe six on their list so what do people vote on\nAny how 'bout you what are you hearing an in New Hampshire are people concerned about the environment this time around how much do you think people are are paying attention to this issue with all the other things they have to worry about at the polls you know interestingly we don't really even have as\nMuch polling data on this as Massachusetts does we have some periodic voter surveys that come up from the University of New Hampshire they ask voters before the primary election what their top problem facing Hampshire what what they thought the top problem was\nBut the choices were limited to drugs health care education and several economic issues we didn't see energy or climate or the environment in general make that list but I can say anecdotally that when I talk to voters especially Democrats\nIt can be a top issue in places like Portsmouth\nOr in in areas that are affected by water contamination and emissions issues it does rise to the service a bit more I think energy is also really rising to the top during the ... campaign but as we've said you know that's not necessarily an environmental issue for every candidate in every voter\nEven though you know it's sort of linked to climate change at its\nBasic level and you know John ... I should say that you know you can if you change the word energy for jobs and then the equation starts changing I think so you know how to your phrase you know energy issues we had to you frame them talk about jobs and people start listening a little differently\nThat's absolutely what we're seeing in New Hampshire to it as a completely an economic issue whether you're here trying to advocate for renewable energy development as a job creator and economic driver or whether you're saying we need to keep rates down and not over subsidize the nobles in order to help businesses survive in the state\nAt ... at an H.
