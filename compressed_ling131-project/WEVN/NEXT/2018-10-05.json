D. cute little ten Ninety One point nine and online at an H. P. R. dot org\n\nFrom NPR and W. B. U. R. I'm Jeremy ... and I'd rather than young it's here and now another tense\nDay this morning that Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nWas voted to to a final floor vote tomorrow that could happen as soon as tomorrow morning but senators can change their vote tomorrow so the drama has been will be a key swing the Senator Jeff flake voted yes in today's procedural votes says he will vote yes to the nomination tomorrow unless something big changes\nAnd Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today says she will again tomorrow telling reporters that Kavanaugh is a good man but not the right man for the court at this time\nAnd right now we're waiting for another key swing senator Maine Republican Susan Collins to make a statement she voted yes to end debate today but may soon say how she actually plans to vote\nTomorrow Collins is going to be speaking on the Senate for momentarily and we will bring that speech to live when it happens but as we wait we're joined in the studio by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow a welcome to both of you Nina\nWhat are you expecting and the next few minutes [laughter]\nIf I if I had a crystal ball believe me I would've said what I was expecting before I this is one of those very dramatic moments because if Susan Collins says that she's going to vote no with Lisa Murkowski then everything\nIs on senator Manchin of West Virginia who's a Democrat in a very red state West Virginia and\nI have no idea whether these three people have been consulting each other the way they did actually up ... up until let's say a ... a day or two ago but at the time when we were that all the stuff was going on about was they're going to be\nAny sort of an FBI investigation um mansion Collins Murkowski 'em and flake all were in constant touch with each other now the question is Scott\nDetrow what do you think's going to happen but I think there are a couple indications that that that ... is going to vote for Kavanaugh the fact that she she viewed the FBI investigation is very thorough unlike Democrats who said that it was woefully short\nAnd the fact that you just had lunch with Mitch McConnell and McConnell apparently emerged with a lunch saying he felt very confident about how the votes going to go he did not look like a leader suddenly scrambling to get the nomination across the finish line\nLike you know when one of you either ... Scott just remind us what's the math here tomorrow I mean what what ... you know what happened to there's a time when a bungled changes as we said right now it's fifty one forty nine to move it forward so what what are\nWe let you got your guy on ...\nUh the the Senate is divided fifty one forty nine Republicans at fifty one seats them\nA cloture vote was a party line vote with two exceptions Murkowski hop to the Democrats to vote no mansion hop to the Republicans to vote yes so if there's one more no votes and there was today and it's fifty fifty then vice president Mike Pence comes and breaks the tie which would certainly be unprecedented for Supreme Court confirmation vote\nScott as you watch this and the decisions that the senators are making it does appear from the outside that their own futures are in their minds more than anything else perhaps that they're thinking about whether this whether it's Joe mansion or whether it's Susan Collins or\nOr others that they're thinking about what it means for them politically coming up in the midterms\nAbsolutely Joe mansion that's the case more than anyone else Joe mansion is a Democrat running for reelection in West Virginia where President Trump is wildly popular\nHe somebody who supported a Trump last nominee Neil Gorsuch\nAnd uh before before the Ford allegations arose look very likely to vote for judge Kavanaugh mentions in a tough spot and I really don't think he wants to be viewed as the decisive vote but that's where he is because if you go if you vote for Kavanaugh if he helps get cabin on the on the court as the lone Democrat and a decisive vote\nDemocrats will will blast him and and and maybe abandoned him over the next few weeks but if he votes no then uh then he might have a lot of support and and they were again President Trump's revival are\nYou guys are looking at pictures outside Susan Collins office right now uh it's packed you know tons of people there and of course that you you will know they've been people\nIn the corridors of the capital you know for the last couple of weeks but a huge crowd there now and then you just you saw because everybody the same sort of new territory and what happens if the vice president has to break a tie what what's your thinking about having a\nVet Kavanaugh heading towards the Supreme Court potentially and it sounds like you know most likely\nOn a tie vote that honor the designer at the time yeah I'm sure that he and his Mitch McConnell\nWill think that that is better than losing\n'em and that he will go there and people will forget that it was a tie vote or that the vice president broke the tie on and I I don't actually think that that it may be significant in some historical sense but given the number\nOf rules that have been changed or broken in the last two years to get through first Neil Gorsuch when\nI'm a Republican leader McConnell a lead the fight and it was much of a fight because they had the votes to get rid of the filibuster rules so that you could confirm somebody with a simple majority instead of needing sixty votes so that was the first one\nThen there were all the rules that were broken or ... or\nLong term a customs of consulting senators from states over a lower court judge chips and the Trump White house stopped doing that in many cases and then there were all the rules about the number of people who could be considered at one time that used to be one or two at\nMost in a single hearing now is you know a half dozen two dozen sometimes so when it comes to judge ships\nThe Republicans who have had locked down control of this process have changed a lot of rules just having the vice president cast the deciding vote I I think would not rank high among them was actually\nGoing to ask someone who's seen as a partisan I you know that that a tie had to be broken but also that you have a retired chief justice Stevens come out and say he was against him or you have you know he's someone who I think you tell me I'm like recent nominees actually worked in the political realm in the Bush White House\nAh was accused of handling other controversial nominations have judges\nAnd saying he wasn't involved in an email ... he was involved I'm going to have to ask you to hold that thought because I think\nWe've done or will says ma'am surging harmful suspend until the [noise] ... order and the gallery [noise]\n...\n[noise]\nObviously I think we're seeing Susan Collins about to announce a decision on the floor but there were protests in on the floor [noise]\n\n\nAs a reminder George gets in the galleries expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted and southern galleries sooner four main\nYou Mr President Mr President the five previous times that I've come to the floor to explain my vote on the nomination of judge since to the United States Supreme court\nI have the gun my floor remarks explaining my decision with a recognition of the solemn and make sure and the importance of the occasion\nBut today we come to the conclusion of a confirmation process\nThat has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature of God or level political campaign than a solemn occasion\nThe president nominated Brett Kavanaugh\nOn July ...\nWithin moments of that announcement special interest groups raised to be the first to oppose him including one organization that didn't even bother to fail and the judges name on it's pre ... press release\nThey simply road\nThat they opposed Donald Trump's nomination up acts\nTo the Supreme Court of the United states a number of senators joined the race to announce their opposition but they were being to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition\nBefore the nominees identities what see even known\nSince that time we have seen special interest groups with their follow words into a frenzy\nAnd quote\nOther sides met with have expressed concerns that Justice Kennedy's retirement threatens the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh\nDescribed the ... decision which legalize same gender marriages as an important landmark\nHe also cited Justice Kennedy's recent masterpiece caged cakes shop opinion for the court's majority stating that\nQuote the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans are gay and lesbian couples\nSecond class citizens who are in theory or in dignity and words are over in the Supreme Court\nAnd\nOthers have suggested that the judge holds the extreme views some birth control in one case judge Kavanaugh

on the future of abortion rights based on the concerns that judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn roe v Wade protecting this race is important to me\nTo my knowledge judge Kavanaugh\nIs the first Supreme Court nominee to express the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition but rooted in article three of our ...\nHe believes that precedent is not just a judicial policy it's constitutionally dictated\nTo pay attention and pay he two roles of precedents\nIn other words precedent isn't a goal or an aspiration it is a constitutional tenant that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances\nThe judge further explain that presidents provide stability predictability reliance and fair enough there are\nRare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court foot race the overturn a precedent\nThe most famous example was when the Supreme Court and brown versus the board of education over rules apply see versus port ...\nCorrecting a gravy asleep wrong decision to use the judges term allowing racial inequality\nBut someone who believe that the importance of precedent has been rooted in the constitution would follow longest established precedent except those rare circumstances\nWhere a decision is gravy a sleeve wrong or deeply inconsistent with the law does\nOur judge Kavanaugh's phrase it\nAs a judge just started to me a long established precedent it's not something to be trimmed narrowed discarded or over and looked\nIts roots in the constitution gives the concept of starry just sites is greater way such that the president can't be trimmed or narrowed simply because the judge might want to on a whim\nEnsured his views on honoring precedent would priests clued a chance to do by stealth\nThat which one has committed not to do over ...\nNoting that roe v Wade was decided forty years forty five years to go and reaffirmed Nineteen years later and Planned Parenthood versus Casey I asked judge cabinet
