about ... this hour\nAnd I don't want to make you feel like you're walking through a minefield every day but you know that there are a lot of poisons growing\nThey got to thinking you know there are a lot of famous stories in history about poisonous\nPlants [noise] Socrates was killed by hand lock and and on and on and I thought it would be interesting to tell the story not to write a field guide poisoners plan but to talk about wind plant have actually\nKilled someone or been used in warfare or for some dark in various\nPurpose [noise] Amy Stewart is a mystery writer and she's the author of the best selling cops history series she is also a serious Gardner with a sidekick\nWriting about we can\nIntroduce Shanahan reply to\nAll\nAbraham Lincoln's mother was killed by a plant she was killed in a very indirect way the plant is white snake rude poisonous cows would grazed on this plant the poison would make them sick but also\nGet into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and it was a real problem throughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact the mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because how do you even do those experiments\nThe KGB starts assassinating people with rice and which is an extract of the castor bean seed and\nWe did not in medical science even know how much rice and it took to kill a person so as late as the Nineteen seventies were doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be a lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human it's amazing how much we still don't know about toxins and plant\nI read that you have a poisonous plant garden and that it's been listed as one of them I think Eighteen most unusual gardens in the world [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I've out that I Want it to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen and some of them are pretty hard to get you can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve manned drinks [laughter] they're just not for sale but\nNow to people and the horticulture community\nPlant start getting offered to me\nKind of secretly like you actually yes I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plans including some illegal plants\nThere was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband and going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plants\nSo like I owe ... maybe you've heard of a hallucinogenic plant from South America\nThings that maybe are not quite illegal but that the da is very aware of and that are hallucinogenic plans but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're you started collecting collecting so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making a creepy so like rather than plant markers I had these cement tombstones that identified what the plant does to you\nMadness or blindness\nI found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they sell their factory seconds on line [laughter]\nSo I had all these lightly divide the skulls and hands and and so I had those are like a skeleton buried those creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical was it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are very pretty plants\nSo I was crying Fox glove did to tell us which is a heart medication it's a great example of a plant that's both medicine and poison depending on the dos and who's taking it\nAnd tobacco's beautiful at flowers and its spending on which one you grow can be quite large and impressive looking plan so yeah a lot of them are very pretty\nI've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness I was reading something about maybe the night shades have an ability to hate\n[laughter] I think that's true well I'm fascinated by this and it is something that we're finding out more about so one way the plants communicate is through route exits so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those rude exits can attract\nCertain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off enemies\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can released a pheromone\nThat would attract the predator of the bug that's attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so this certainly suggest that they're able to react to stimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting to figure out\nDo you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world\nOh sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that\nYou don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect against predators it's a mistake to think that because some things green and comes out of the ground that it's all natural and it's there for good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based is\nMore healthy and superior in some way but strychnine as a hundred percent plant based on what a cyanide so it was a rice and\nThey're just trying to keep from getting eaten\nPlants are rooted in the ground they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why plants have\nForeign or spines are stinging medals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to\nEat them [noise]\nAmy Stewart she writes mystery\nNovels in addition to books like drunken most wicked plants\nAnd that was shot and Henry cyber talking with her\nOne of the really fascinating things about poisons [noise] is it in small doses they can to a\nLarger doses killed\nSo much power in a simple leaf for mushroom or white powder\nSo much potential for the right or\nThey can be tempting\n[laughter] we're\nCapturing if I wanted to poison someone today what would be the best way to go about\nCentral I you know you want to get away\nWith it [noise] absolutely [noise] when you need to do in a very good study on how much they have\nAny particular disease age\nHe wants to pick a poison that mimics some of The Simpsons what you're trying to the point the auto bailout\nTentative corn poison someone using more heavy one and then leave the country to someone that doesn't have an extradition treaty that I'd be real option she won't she poisonous I'm going to get away with it [noise]\nAnd what about delivery mechanisms\nReally passions to shake contact poison poison would have been inhaled in ... while I was I did just huge\nIt's a very intimate kind of killing don't you think [noise]\nIt's a statement it is quite staggering and terrifying the amount to do that goes into the price is it very very big here an unpleasant [noise]\n\nKatherine heart up as a chemist and writer and author of a is for

joining on a life of days weeks months time that's what she said the pain as being a righty andme girl was like\nAnd in the meantime the girls would go to the companies and the companies would say no

as you say the the debts the depravity to which they would sing they hired private detectives to dig up dust on these women you know they actively lie to them they concealed medical test results and it's just astonishing you watch the comedy that anyone would be that inhumane\nThere's one I remember there's I think you wrote that at one point they tested a lot of the girls for their radium levels they didn't give the girls the test results but they themselves created a list of who's going to die first yeah\nThat is exactly what happened they graded then depending on how radioactive Iowa and\nSo I saw in the ... when I was researching it staggering black and white a list of all the women's names and a number next to that name you know from one three to five\nI don't see how somebody could look at a woman a young woman no you've got her name on a list and you know she's going to be dead in a year and look her in the face and say you're fine when I\nI I think it just goes to show just how expendable disposable people full of women are not time that was One Fund in Connecticut who settled with that girls\nAnd one woman mills recalled I who died and he's six months after she'd been not right on the phone off the husband settlement\nBut the sun they offered him was forty three dollars and\nLess than fifty dollars for human life keep it one of your favorite young women to
