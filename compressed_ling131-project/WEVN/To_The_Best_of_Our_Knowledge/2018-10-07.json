been rolling around in my mind what is wrong with men [noise]\nI'm I've read a bunch of articles suggesting the problem is toxic masculinity\nBut today we've got a story about a group of people who think just the opposite that one of the biggest problems in America is that men are under attack literally [noise] Alexandra hall has our story which begins with a Wisconsin police report oh\nThis is

antifa [noise]\nSo this kind of political violence has become not routine but not unexpected either ... Alexander Hall is an investigative reporter and she first heard the story when she was working on a pro public a project called documenting hate\n[laughter] we're looking for hate groups in Wisconsin [laughter] my boss told me about the story [laughter] the headline was Madison police investigating possible ambush of proud boy by anti fascist and I thought were the proud\n\nKnow they seem really pissed off and irritated about woke culture and the PC culture that they feel like they have to\nAnd so what the Proud Boys are about is not happy and apologize for being a man's man\nAnd they want to return to that [laughter]\n[noise]\nWe politically if you've had to nail it's on the spectrum I Would say Ninety five percent of his land on the new right they're socially liberal fiscally conservative they don't really care if you're gay or anything like that\nBut they think the tradition has some value and there's been you know we've thrown up the baby with the bathwater quite

suddenly he's asking you whether you're planning on having babies I think that's kind of his and now\nLike feminism is obsolete\nIt definitely had a a place that women needed to vote somebody needed to drive but the pendulum has swung way past that so I Would say feminism was done and maybe Nineteen Seventy nine and since then it's just been woman inventing problems in lying\nLike saying one in four women will be sexually assaulted or raped in college are saying that women earn less than men\nDo you think that the statistics about sexual assault and the wage gap is just that it's not true\nWell I don't think you've looked it up if you think they are\nAnd that makes me think why do you care which makes me think you don't care which makes me think you need to find a man you need to focus on creating an shaping lives because you don't sound like a tiny percentage that we better off in the workforce I think you'd make a great mom you're clearly curious\n[noise] I don't even know what to say about that [laughter] what did you think\nI thought it was a distraction I thought it was strange that he was making it personal\nWant to be curious about the quality of the schools your

girls you went to\nA point [noise] men and women are physiologically created different\nBecause of their physiological bio chemical makeup\nMen and women are predisposed to gravitate towards different fields you think that I Do think that's the case absolutely to the field a health care for one I think nursing for one that that's one\nIn men\nEngineering fields math fields\nAre you saying that like men are better than no no\nMy little sisters of biomedical engineer she's great\nI have a lot of ideas about where women would be happy as\nAt home versus in the workplace\n... are looked down upon\nLike they're not doing enough when really their shaping lives and what's more important than that [noise]\nAnd what do you think about women\nThey were very cautious about hey you don't want to be a housewife that's cool with us for the housewives you want to be housewives don't look down on him personally\nI Love the idea of my wife to raise my kids I Love that\nIf I have to be at work in the late at work there's somebody there that's taking little Timmy to baseball practice or picking Sarah from soccer practice in certain people have attempted to make them feel bad for them and we're doing we're vendor reading the house like that is on a pedestal now\nThat is the ... is being a doctor my wife was a doctor my wife is a housewife\nThey're to me\nAs far as ... concerned at the same way\nToo much of this conversation seems curiously nostalgic you know like ... for the day is when moms stayed home with kids and dad's had\nJobs that they could count on\nYeah it is interesting um you know I don't know how many of the Proud Boys actually believe all of that\nGathering as a whole nother thing he's sane I Believe Ninety five percent of women would be happier at home you need to go home\nWe want women to be happier we weren't guys just stopped ignoring them and masturbating to porn we want guys to stop treating them like a colossal me back for someone else's each Jackie late you know the feminist mentality bodes very well for guys who just want to screw women and then dumped them when they become thirty five\nI think women have their head screwed on properly they realize that it's these so called sexist\nWho have their best interests in mind we don't want them dumped we don't want them given the milk away for free because we want them to sell the cow\nAnd no for the record [noise]\nWomen earn more than men when they're your age before they make babies they end up earning less over time because they choose to\nWomen tend to choose jobs that are less strenuous less risky they tend to want to go home for their daughter's piano recital running stay at the office all night and that costs them promotions down the line so the wage gap is an easy method he bought it takes you honestly sixty seconds\nAnd when feminist harp on it\nI go yeah you're pretending to carry your virtue signaling and it's a waste of everyone's time it's a pain in my ass\nYou kept your cool remarkably mean probably if you had a video camera in the studio at the during the interview my eyes got wide a few times did you find the source that you've been Batman [noise]\n[laughter]\nStill
