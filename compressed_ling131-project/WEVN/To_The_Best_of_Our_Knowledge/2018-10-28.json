those are coincidences of\nYeah just truly uncanny things that happened\nHere's one [noise]\n\nI don't know if I Believe and goes but um that's a story of\nThe ghost of William Joseph ...\nThis is your aunt march and she's talking about her father\nFather died when he was eighty in Nineteen eighty three it's about her father's ghost and how he appeared in the house they grow up in Michigan\n\n\nWe kept the house for the first year after my father went to assisted living and then we sold it\nAnd in Nineteen Ninety no I'm Sorry would have been Nineteen Ninety five\nI took a walk down the street where I grew up and the man who had bought the house or a model that\nAsked me if I wanted to see it and I said yes so he introduced me to his wife and I went into the house and she was telling me about how they expanded it and she said your father's ghost has been here and I looked at her like she was a little\nWacko\nAnd she said they were remodeling the first part of the house\nAnd this decision or a man or a figure appeared and she went running out of the house and to her husband and said there is a man in the house and she described what she saw and the neighbor across the street was talking to her husband and he said sounds like Bill Bradley\n\nSeveral months later her husband was downstairs in the basement doing some electrical work and the same person or whatever decision appeared and she went running down the stairs to say he's back and found out her husband had electrocuted himself\nAnd she ran upstairs called nine eleven and they came and treated her husband or whatever it was they do [noise]\nSo when I got back to Michigan I found a picture of my father in his thirties the pitcher my father and his sixties and I sent those pictures to her and she wrote back and she said my ghost is your father [noise]\nSo I Would say that you're at Marge is actually one of the more skeptical members of your family I Would say that's true yeah when I've heard Wilder's stories oh yeah I mean there are stories of ... after spirit possession\nOf bizarre coincidence is that your mom was it goes to my mom was a ghost hunter in Milwaukee for a while I I grew up with this stuff but here's the family straight arrow\nI've been around a lot of true believers and I am not one is probably not an accident that I became a journalist and yet this stuff the uncanny the paranormal\nYou read about this stuff all the time why there are some serious questions intellectual questions about what is real\nWithout throwing your intellect out the window your rationality out the window where do you make of that store without just saying oh that's impossible you know there's just there's no way one of those interesting people I talked to was Michael Schober the ...\nIt was Michael shear me he is a scientist an atheist a regular columnist for Scientific American he has the founding publisher of skeptic magazine and he's the guy you go to if you want to have someone throw cold water on these crazy turn almost stories\nStrange thing is he has his own story\nWell so my wife's from a clone Germany she was raised by a single mom and her grandfather and her grandfather had this radio this little Philips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so [noise]\n\nThey used to listen to music meaning her and when he died\nShe kept it and it stopped working you know long ago [noise]\nAnyway and when she we met and fell in love and so and she moved to Los Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio\nAnd I tried to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put new batteries in and checked the wires and slapped on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of\nA drawer in the bedroom and it didn't think about it for months and then you know in the day of our wedding [noise] just set up particular\nMoment when she was feeling rather sad that there was nobody there from her family and friends a long way from home\nYou know we heard music playing in the back of the house when it was like what was that you know and I thought well I'm a slip my iPhone honor my laptop with tunes or maybe the next door neighbors playing music and it was none of that and then we [noise]\nIt was open the door beneath the fax machine and then there's the rate that plane is blamed Islam is a perfectly you know perfectly tuned to a station [noise] for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience I mean it meant something\nTo her ... her symbolically anyway like the grandfather was there with us and the day of our wedding and make her feel good and it did [noise]\nIt played the rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and they went there the next morning endeavor sense even though I get it to work and and still won't work it's still there [noise]\nTo just share my that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence not really but [laughter] it kind of ... [laughter]\nIt was like whoa man ... column down [laughter] they call it it's okay [laughter] uh yeah a little bit but but I also as insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences makes me more\nOpen to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand the yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about this and I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of get the allergy of skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this and Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen you know my friend is not really religious friends with people I ... I think that there's a you know it's sort of a quantum field that inner connects all of this in it quantum consciousness way\nHe thinks that it's a sign you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife said numerous experiences and last year and a half where she felt sad or\nWas missing home and the radio didn't come on ...\nBut this was this was your wedding day well it was yeah I mean there was something a little unusual because I mean there is another I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that\nThe most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable there there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nPossible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from revision energy a local employee owned company helping thousands of granite staters go solar\nRevision energy is currently growing their team of electricians and plumbers learn more at revision energy dot com slash careers\nIs is that it is beyond the natural I think science studies natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologists Tanya Letterman [noise] so I'm the kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties\nAnd you know I haven't told anybody this but my goodness I was in the hospital I find myself up in the corner of the room looking down at my body [noise]\nPeople see things that people don't see or couldn't see the here things with other people couldn't tear they sometimes feel their mind leading their body and was in around me these experiences happened to people and in fact I think they're pretty common\nSo she has been her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and when she was a grad student in England she was really interested in the ... community practitioners of magic and she joined in\nSo as not apologist you do what the deal that you've come to study does\nNo I meant I cast spells I was part of groups of people who were conjuring up power I was I learned to read tarot cards I learned to a little bit about astrology a lot about the law and participated in these different groups as they met to\nCarry out their ritual metric did it become real for you or at least ... one of the things I could see was that people experience the magic Israel\nAnd so I I put to the side the question of whether magical forced really existed what I could see and what I came to experience is that if you spent time in this world and you did the kinds of things that people did to\nI'm conscious channel I take dictation from guys that worked for me and actually dictate entire books through me that require no editing so I'm primarily known as a conscious channel and I also work as an ... path which is\nA psychic ability I have this either but we need to step into other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio that's the way to look at me and who are you channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that their teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness than we are at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere was a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in\nIdeas of lineage in history that I mean so is that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have different personalities elective I work with a collective but yet there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what are they look like the one that I've seen but I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through and\nI was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat down and he was\nYou know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hat and it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat out the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was in Boston the weathering was raised and it was higher clinics and I didn't know what any of it meant the time and um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard\nAnd he had a Purple Rose of some kind of when you when you have that image I mean do you do take that literally do you think this is what this guy really I think that's how he presented himself for me\nSo this all sounds kinda crazy yeah and in Akron imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences that might have felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly see we're not you did not come out of her religious not only not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things it was a convenient\nAgnostics ism I suppose one I was twenty five I was a year out of graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened and I began\nTo pray or to embark on my what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path\nAnd things begin to happen as a result of that too I what started happening\nWell the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like a fog comes in and rounds out all of your other thoughts as well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like\nA fog comes in and around out all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I could explain it\nAnd I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyper\nEither after I sort of seeing this things these flashes started you know going off\nSo when you say seem lights around people without ... what do they look like\nWells fireflies sparks little blue lights over the top of the head so I ended up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\nI'm sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical she or he might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was in while you're for twenty five years teaching creative writing my writing yeah I talked play running for very long time\nAnd you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this\nBut once the first book came out I had to begin to own it a bit more and that was a challenge to you're not you're not teaching creative writing and you know I'm not ... I'm traveling around the world\nSitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing them at all of this energy comes in and fills the room and people who come are having an experience with it\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not a good ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with your dead relatives and I don't like doing productive work\nBut if you're actually having problems in your relationship and you give me your spouse his name I can step into your spouse to begin to look like her and possibly hear what's going on at the dynamic and that's been proven out in the film when I'm channeling I'm really just operating as a radio\nSo I'm just sitting in the chair and letting the dial turn to the station that wants to come through\nAnd then being receptive to take the dictation desert so\nPlay that out from ... explained that farm if you can when you say you're like a radio you know you got to sort of tune into the channel and then the guides we'll we'll speak through you see how does that work I mean ... where are you in that where where his poll selling diamond associated\nI'm president but I'm receded a you sort of in an altered state of conscious I think I'm going to like trance it's light enough that I can interrupt and ... and and and say hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense which I've been known to do and the rule with all of the books is that they could they can't be edited so all of the books or the on edited transcripts of the sessions\nWeights they really are you are and you're not going at you know sort of cleaning up the way you're saying these books either they're not written by you it's like reading your automatic writing and you know no no they're spoken these are oral teachings that are transcribed\nDo you think about the metaphysics of all of this okay what's the architecture of this universe that you are describing here\nI Do and I don't I think I only do when I'm sitting with somebody who asks those questions okay well you're you're sitting with one right now I'm not going to access it myself because I actually don't know and I would have to recede and begin traveling on your show and I think what's already\nThe way we started off this conversation so far out to begin with him and he's still listening I Am absolutely thrilled [laughter]\nYou know honestly when I first started doing this stuff I didn't want to record it I wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group in my apartment that meant for Eighteen years with\nAbout ten people who would show but the most every week and we would sit in a circle and the guys were talking they would bring this energy through and we would all feel it\nWhat are the guides say you know you've written you know multiple bucks an hour they have through new mayor or is there sort of a common message\n[noise] yeah I think that who we truly are is not what we think we are in Middle East and and I really talk about humanity being at a at a transitional point that's evolution right now and the the opportunity\nWould they would say is I think are true identity and how you identify yourself and your life\nIs primarily based on a lot of collective agreements what it means to be a man whatsoever culture you were brought up in what it means to be a success with beauty is all of these things to be collectively ascribed\nGreat value to is really inherited information and it's actually in most cases operating at a cost\nThis is what they've said they've said that humanity is a time of reckoning in a reckoning is facing of one's self and all the little ones creations and what's been created in fear needs to be recreated in the higher way\nHas anything changed in your own life as a result of all this I mean obviously you what you're doing day to day you know the workshops that you give the toxic if that's different you're not the university teacher anymore but in terms of I don't know how you think what your values are I think\nIt's all different it's all different I'm a lot less afraid when I was and I have to say that I was very frightened person ... much of my life\nAfraid of what things life yeah life you\nKnow I was a sensitive kid you know when I grew up wary consequently and I suppose in some ways maybe I still am you know there's a quote from Helen ... the woman who was the channel for coursing miracles [noise] she\nSaid I don't believe it but I Know it's true and I can get behind that I understand that I don't believe it either but I Know it's true what you mean you don't believe that you must believe it I don't I don't I Know that it's happening I don't know how it's happening I don't know how I Do what I Do\nI'm I'm very happy to be able to be part of this but I'm Still challenged by the whole experience\nThat's Paul Salopek he's published five channel tax Steve we started\nEarlier talking about your family and all the stories of family goes to the paranormal has doing all these interviews changed how you feel about your family's experiences and stories\nYeah it has it has um [noise] yeah I take them more seriously\nWe have really good conversation [laughter] when the family gets together because you know we have these mutual interests and we come at it very differently and uh I'm a speaker\nAnd you know I had my own way of doing it and they are secrets to\nBe there's something in common there and it's
