Hemings Jefferson\nSnow here to see um [noise]\nI think the family marker you're looking for\nIf you don't know who that is he was the son of our third president his black so [noise]\nLike a lot of our founding fathers Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and was one of them her name was Sally Hemings he had children\nSo how did one of them wind up in Wisconsin graveyard\nThat story is like a giant metaphor for America's tangled racial for us\nIt makes everything was the youngest son as Sally Hemings and Thomas Jeffrey since he\nCame to Madison well it would have been right after the passing in the fugitive slave act so we should go back a little bit in time after Thomas Jefferson\nDied he created all of his children their freedom\nAs was Sally Hemings freedom\nThey grow up slaves\nOn your own mom to tell on Jefferson's plantation and then once they're fried some of them identified as African American authors passed because they had lighten up skills\nThey were all fairly fair skinned and they could pass even Julia\n... wife was also multiracial and so she could also pass as white they were in the sense is an Eighteen fifty in Ohio identified as mulatto but then after the fugitive slave act passed in Eighteen fifty\nAccent and Julie I decided to take their three kids and moved further north away from the border and they moved to Madison, Wisconsin and here they passed as whites and they identified as white they lived among white society and nobody ever questioned that and that is how they continued their life\nJohn and that really who were essence two sons both served in the civil war they served in Wisconsin regiments at the time of the civil war\nIf you were African American and identify that way you had to be in a colored regiment both of them served in white regiment so clearly there is no question that they were white and that they identified that way\nJohn the older when he moved to Memphis and became a cotton shepherd was very successful at it but never married there's some theories that he chose not to because if he had a child who was dark skin that would sort of blow his cover I guess in a manner of speaking and then he could lose everything\nThat really did marry he had sons of his own he stayed in Madison he ran a very successful large carriage company here and purchase diverse I'm the best and Madison actually\nSo these children up a former slave became these prosperous Rainman in Madison, Wisconsin\nYeah they did and I have no idea why they chose Madison one would assume maybe had something to do with the name [laughter] but you know it was also obviously further north certainly safer from the fugitive slave act\nWhen I first heard that one of the children of Thomas Jefferson\nAnd Sally Hemings was buried half a mile from where I live\nWhere Pedro up yeah I was surprised\nToo and actually I didn't know it until I was on our cemetery Hillary and one of my co workers pointed this out and I said I'm Sorry who [laughter]\nThey're all over the mid west very so family members and Michigan still some in Ohio now this kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states\nJust thinking about the history of this I mean so you have the son\nOf Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have\nA child who grew up in slavery it's like these threats of American history come together right here in the cemetery\nRight it's interesting how little it sort of know about your local history and how it all\nKind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today Thomas Jefferson is so famous right and he stands for so many things I don't think you can avoid kind of feeling the weight of that here\nUm Mm\n\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison both\n\nSo by now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life\nSally Hemings and that they had children in what Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white descendants denied [noise] and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories passed down by Sally Hemings children\nEven DNA evidence ma she became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for history\nFollowed by a MacArthur genius award and she told steep awesome this story is a perfect example of the way many Americans have tried to bury and deny the real history of slavery\nI think most people in the black community did not doubt it because we understand that this kind of thing happened quite a bit and so it didn't seem like it was wild and crazy\nIf they had free papers people would know that they were part black because they've been in slaves and you'd be able to trace them one reason we don't know about their descendants is because they have no paper trail ... we know about Madison it asked and and that's the thing about documents that the importance of them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson the\nRevered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality who's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children together I mean what\nWould we do well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery\nAnd we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work for no money\nOr whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape through connections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable I think the thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take him down from the mountain as this revered icon\nNo there are things to admire about Jefferson and we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who ... who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country not just Jefferson Washington at all of them the number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage\nAnd profited from that I think you have to take the bitter with the sweet and I don't know that it's ever good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you I think a better way to look at it is to say this is what these human beings did on their time on earth and some of it was good and some of them was bad\nAnd what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that we were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already gotten mystic view of race relations didn't eat I mean he was he was racist and he thought\nBlack people were inferior we're not as smart as one\nAnd that's what most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I ventured is a suspicion only but it's not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks\nThat was the currency of the time I Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really animated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America\nHe'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society that's what he was fixated on that slavery thing that'll solve itself but it's like many things in life you say if I could just fix this that little thing over there it'll be fine but it's that little thing over there that destroys the thing that you love\nYeah and slavery was he came to see the walk upon which\nThe union will be split and that was true\nYeah thank you very much assistance to\nThat's Harvard legal historian Annette Gordon Reed talking with the false and ...\nHer book the Hemingses of Monticello won a Pulitzer Prize at the national book Martin\nSuch
