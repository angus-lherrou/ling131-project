locks up to male passengers on the St Petersburg metro and ports\nChoose from a plastic bottle their crime she says is man's spreading\nJustice or an overreaction\nBroadly most people felt that fell into one of those two categories but actually it belongs to a third category according to an e anti disinformation website this video was staged and it is crumbling propaganda Nikolai ... is a reporter and a video producer\nWould mashable dot com [laughter] when I first of all what kind of on line reaction and comments has this video provoked\nWell first of all before people figure it out of there was a fake video it received quite a substantial coverage in terms of western media everybody was jumping on sort of the bandwagon of a you know this woman in Russia\nActually as a in preparation for this you know just open Google and I and I wrote viral spreading video I just wanted to see which which article that are going to be first they actually you can still see that the majority of the articles in the Google Search or remain the the videos that don't\nKnow that it's it's actually a staged a stage process or or a fake process so that's actually quite interesting\nHow do you know let's say ... what what what was the evidence that was presented that say that this was a fake story that this man's betting thing was just staged\nWhen I first watched it what seems really strange is that the female blogger in in the video the female blogger that's talking about this and that staging this a protest or has been known in Russia to do this in the past but unlike this uh particular video she has\nBrought a serious issue is like a you know ups courting and other forms of you know sexual assault that women in Russia tend to face and what what struck me about this video is that the tone was very different and it was almost aggressive and the way that she was approaching so cold men spreading a people on on the subway and it it just seems a little bit off in how she\nWas trying to prove a point about an\nIssue like men sprinting which was an entirely different ballpark to ups courting once\nThe article on the eve this information side came out the evidence that they give\nFor it being fake is that he was actually published by a an outlet that's owned by Russia Today which is a you know a media outlet that directly owned by the Kremlin or the outlet it's called into now which used to be a show on the arts website which is now its own sort of vertical and it's quite popular on Facebook\nAnd that's where the the video that when most viral was posted and that's at that video actually still is on line\nOr there are other versions of the video that were posted on YouTube where have not been taken down but the original video or Facebook video is actually still on Facebook and I think at the time that I checked it had like six million views [laughter]\nI wasn't do part of the debunking that uh the men who are in it because if people haven't seen the video\nMen are sitting man's spending on a subway their legs are a part she's next to them or standing about them she pours this liquid into their lap say look startled looks at the how did we come to know that these were actors who are paid\nThere's there's an online magazine in ... in St Petersburg called ... and uh they posted some interviews with one of the men who appeared to video\nWho said that he was actually page and subsequently other other testimonies of people of men into video posted online on social media saying uh you know that they appeared in the video and they were a couple of paid actors\nI think the exact posts with you know you can you come in for a job with welfare pants and you and you leave with money in your pocket [noise] um and then what will you know once once to sort of the investigation got a little bit deeper it turned out that potentially get this video was filmed by um\nBy a studio that that are known to have worked with Archie and with the Kremlin end up in the past so the connections\nThe deeper you look why would this be of interest as Kremlin propaganda why what what's why why this sounds like a a not a large issue for the state government why why would they they help to fund something like this\nIt's it's one of it it it's sort of like one of many uh issue said they tried just sort of like sport\nDebate and and and sort of their anger and the reason why we are talking about it's just they got caught and that's the thing that I think it's different now than let's say two or three years ago\nAnd what the video was basically trying to do it is trying to show how a woman is you know is going too far she's being aggressive in in sort of protecting our so called you know in in quotation marks or her feminist sort of the last ...\nThe only goal is to is to store I'm anti feminist sentimentality in in in people around the world particularly people in the west but it's also\nYou know once this goes back to Russia you know it allows politicians\nFor example to it's a talking point where they can go back and then sort of\nStarts to pour it into more conservative parts of the country I think there was one politician one uh from from putting his party who said really nasty things about this uh\nActivists in about ten minutes and journals so it allows them to actually bring back certain points about how important is to keep a conservative society and how we shouldn't be like misled by liberal or a radical liberal sort of ideas like sending them and things like that\nWhen you said that when he checked on line they just to now you found that to some sites don't seem to know that at stake but do you think it's more the case that they don't care that they're not talking about mainstream media but I Do think that there is at the point now where it doesn't even matter if it's too as long as it's effective\nYes um I think I think so I don't know if it well I don't know if\nThe desired effect is actually achieved I Know that the if the the article that to you this permission site a I added a comment that had fourteen thousand likes a it's sort of proof that people are are getting kind of enraged by this or by the staging act and that it that it potentially\nHas started some anti feminist a sentiment but I to be honest I think we shouldn't place too much\nEmphasis on on these kinds of attempts at propaganda they they are they are plentiful and they exist across confident in in in in Europe and in in the U.S but I don't think\nThere are are sort of like a starts worry too much about these kinds of a temperature that that the the Kremlin is attempting you know different kinds of propaganda ah disinformation campaigns and it it it's sort of a hit or miss rather than a or a central a central I sort of a strategy\n[noise] All right we'll leave it there nickel and thank you thank you\n... is a reporter and a video producer with mashable dot com or we reached him in London, UK we

what did you think when you got the notification\nOh over so many thoughts going through my head basically I was in shock I was stunned um I felt almost nauseous was there a mistake could this be a mistake but DNA doesn't lie I mean DNA is DNA so I figured\nI actually have a sister and I wanted to explore a bit further is that I told you you had to you had the sister of their\nInitial notification set a close family member and I got her name when I logged into ancestry DNA about her name and I was curious because I had no idea who this girl was that was supposedly a close family member\nAnd I decided to send a message through the ancestry website because as I said I had her name but I didn't know who she was and I reached out to her and said pretty much a who are you and it
