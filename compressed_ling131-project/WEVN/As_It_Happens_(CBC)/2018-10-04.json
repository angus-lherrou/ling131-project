presidents tends to repeat himself and one of the things that he has repeated over and over and over again is how he is a quote self made billionaire\nWell a New York times investigation offers a somewhat different perspective it reveals that Mr Trump received four hundred and Thirteen million US dollars from his father's real estate empire most of it\nBecause he helped his family dodge taxes [noise]\nTwo years ago reporters Suzanne Craig a Canadian was mailed to Mr Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax returns\nShe told us he had possibly avoid paying federal taxes for Eighteen years but now the times is reporting that Mr Trump participated in outright fraud we reached Suzanne Craig in New York City\nSo then you put out a tweet and what do you up to last night as you waited for this story to be printed in today's paper what did you do\nAfter a after we were finished at work I went out to a ... New York times press plant in Queens and I watch the uh the story that we wrote roll off the process\nSo we last time we spoke a couple of years ago you received a brown paper ... in which you had a part of Donald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax return and from that you were able to extrapolate a lot of information but since then\nYou have found other streams of documents to describe what you would not during the past two years what you have an earth since then\nSure we continue to look at the Donald Trump's taxes off for the story that we rode in two thousand and sixteen where we got three pages of his tax returns right before election day um and we just continue to push on his falling out says part of the exam and\nTens of thousands of public documents and we also got access to thousands and thousands of confidential documents for Trump's real estate empire\nYou tend to questions to Donald Trump his lawyer Charles Harder responded that should that time stage or implied that President Trump participated in fraud or tax evasion or any other crime it will expose you to buy ability and damages for defamation so I Know the language is careful here and is in the article how would you characterize\nThe charges you're putting out here concerning Donald Trump his family and their families empire\nWell we found in terms of the the the wrong doing we found several instances based on the documents that we looked up where a Donald Trump participated in fraudulent talk ski [noise]\nIt's getting into some examples of if you are now we just say for instance can we talk about what happened when ah they knew it was huge numbers of loans that Donald Trump received from his father had grown to into the millions of dollars how did he covered for those\nDonald Trump is sort of long claimed as part of of this this narrative that his credit for himself that he's sort of a pretty much up from golfing businessmen who made it to the president he's like a self made billionaire and then we felt not only did we we uncovered in the documents not only at least sixty one million dollars in loans\nThat are that Trump extend it to Donald Trump cases many of them were repaid we also found that Donald Trump received over ... lifetime more than ... and beyond also as an inheritance more than four hundred million dollars from his father\nSaid Trump is his father and there's one instance you give that the fed Trump at one point\nBuy a stake in at ... palace how how did the heat then and then sold it back to his son can you describe that\nSure I think spent Fifteen million it would be a generous description of it he Donald Trump owed um his father Fifteen million dollars and not that debt I'm instead of being a you know written off\nWas in fact he used it to invest in the Trump polish so he turned the debt into an investment in Trump powerless and then it was written down to almost nothing\nYou mentioned companies the old county building supply maintenance can you tell us what that was\nSure that was one of the most intriguing a fraud that we found it was probably the most kind of ones with the bright lights around it is from Trump was getting older and to his eighties\nHe he'd only not only you know huge number of buildings and the New York area worth hundreds of millions of dollars but he was also sitting on a huge amount of cash and Donald Trump ... siblings realized that\nAt some point he was going to die and not money was going to be subject to a fifty five percent and heritage talks to what the Trump ... kids that it's it's pretty incredible for years for Trump would\nYou know for his buildings he would buy everything from fringes and so and then one day a company called ... county was created and suddenly all county started doing all the buying for fried Trump's\nEmpire they would pay three hundred dollars for new fridge is but then they would create a separate receipt and they would mark it up anywhere from twenty to fifty percent and send it up to Fred\nAnd the difference on not was pocketed by all county which\nWas controlled by Donald Trump and his siblings it mounted allowed them to drain huge amounts millions of dollars in cash from their fathers empire so that it would not be subject to the death tax\nJust finally the kind of an overarching a theme of this this investigation is that\nThat Donald Trump is presented is understood to have been a self made man isn't ... why does it matter what is that in what way does it fit into the story about fried as to how Donald Trump benefited profited from that in the solid G\nWell he's he's benefitted greatly over the years from this this law that has been repeated over and over and over and\nI guess just the myth making of him that's been wrong and it's a spectacular call and it was interesting as we were going through the reporting early on in the Nineteen seventies right out you know when he graduates and he goes to work for his father he does an interview with the New York times and he goes around and he he talks about this job that's his and\nAnd this building that says and he's driving around in a car and he's you know showing this reporter all this stuff and it was incredible every\nEvery building he showed the reporter was his father's even though he claimed it was his own as his life went on he then started to diminish his father's achievements you know he would say only about a million dollar loan my father was a great building but it was in Brooklyn and queens and then when it came time in two thousand and four or five years after Trump staff\nTo sell the empire the biggest single payday in his life in two thousand and four was done very quietly\nAnd just finally what was that final payday\nThat year was ... just under two hundred million dollars he got roughly like a hundred and Seventy seven million\nThe empire itself sold for roughly eight hundred million in and we found through other records that as it should have been valued at roughly a billion so you've been on that day the man who wrote the art of the deal you know I think got less than a lot less than he probably should have for that sale\nExtraordinary Suzanne thank you very much just making this okay great thank you\nBye And Craig is the New York times reporter responding to the times investigations states taxation authority in New York City would review the allegations and his quote vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues\nThere is more on this story on our website CBC dot CA slash a I H\nIn most parts of the country in his early autumn but in parts of Alberta you wouldn't be forgiven for mistaking it for the next season\nYesterday instead of pleasant multi colored leaves snow fell in areas around Calgary a lot of snow as much as sixty centimeters of snow if you were inside sipping tea it was not welcome but\nOtherwise not a huge deal if you were on the roads it was a nightmare on one highway hundreds of motorists were stuck for hours stretching into the night\nTrumpet player ... was one of them and after a while he decided to get out of his car and serenade his fellow stranded motorist we reached Mr ... in Calgary\nEnds when did you realize yes today did you are well and truly stuck on the road\nI looked ahead and I saw a bunch of uh truckers with their flashers on and became a dead stop pretty much in the middle of nowhere and neither lane was moving left or right at a quick look around one of those semi rigs and I could see cars as far as you could possibly\n... and so what time of the day to day this did you get stuck to not move again what time is that\nWhile I was a leisurely drive back I hit the the actual car ... walk at about ... am and that's when we can't go full stop and it was bright outside and it wasn't too cold just below zero so I didn't feel like there was going to be too big of a problem\nAnd how long we are there well I was up there for ten and a half hours and hadn't moved an inch nobody has there were literally hundreds but probably a thousand cards easily\nThat the that the it's open up and all for fishing fleets or any kind of vessels really short of the heaviest icebreakers\nTo get in there or if you look at the the topography drag graffiti I should say of central Arctic ocean you can see just outside the two hundred mile limits of Canada the United states and Russia there is an area that is particularly accessible it's the area that clears up from the earliest and longest in the summer\nAnd it's an area that has a child she plateau in particular which as water ... to ... meters which\nIs a very efficient both at the water we don't know really uh how much fishes there and we should expect that there's not a lot\nAbout their own do and we saw him and it's probably our big cod and our economy is younger painting all the pretty much the entire Arctic ecosystem CEOs whales\nOverbearing directly you know depended on the Arctic God for the food source and it's a very oily fish it would lend itself very well to what's referred to as a reduction fishery\nOr where you catch this fish you a ... century into into a meal out all the fish milk product and you know there's demand for that uh the central Arctic ocean has only eight to ... to find out it was only eight thousand miles from courts in Southeast Asia\nSo you know it is accessible and I said I and many of these cases\nInsurance then be prosecuted economically but they can't be prosecuted sustainable\nAnd I think that's the case for central Arctic ocean stands right now\nOkay understand you correctly in these countries who had designed the Arctic five is they call them kind of Norway Russia Denmark a United States the fishing nations Iceland Japan South Korea China European Union they've all signed onto this\nFor sixteen years is march I Am but they're looking at some pretty rich fish stuck in there that they want to get their hands on so I I you're saying that you can imagine that would be any time when you could sustainably fish there so what happens is the end is sixteen years and they say okay you've had your way and now we're getting in there\nWell I don't know that it can never have a I don't think you're going to happen right now and I don't take it could happen in foreseeable future nevertheless there is a mechanism for renewal four and five year increments it will not\nBe renewed only if somebody puts up their hands so to speak of says we want to end this agreement you know I think that before we go too far into the future speculate on what might happen\nI I think the important thing here today is to is to you know reflect on the fact that this actually happened right now which is just so impressed and I was I still can't really believe that because you're not so much that people would go there today because there is a is a commercially viable stock\nPeople have a tendency sometimes state so pushing companies to gold places the state they ground you know what I'm saying that I was there so when the time comes\nI have to be at the table to have my piece of the pie\nA and that's been prevented here now\nAll right well it could be interesting to watch what happens in the central Arctic ocean I thank you very much for telling us about Mr Tanner\nThank you very much for your interest by\nTrump retailers the VP of conservation with oceans north
