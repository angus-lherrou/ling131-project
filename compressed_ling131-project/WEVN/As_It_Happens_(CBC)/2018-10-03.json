Campbell in Cambridge, Massachusetts\nIs Kendall how much was this week's announcement of the new deal a bit of deja vu all over again for you\nWell some things took me back to reveal olden days at the candidate us free trade agreement I was particularly\nThat have been used at the comment about the the president didn't like our negotiator and I was thinking that we should have checked the irrepressible in this article in movable sign of respect [laughter] just like if you're if\nYou've ever I Do the bulldog I tried to interview him many times\nYeah so um but I Know I think you're going to go to shelters have tapped to be kept but I think personally I feel a a sigh of relief because I think you know things could have been much worse and daily and kind of uncharted territory here with this with this president\nIn fact that the liberals are kind of calling it to the could have been a lot worse deal so what is really different though from NASA because this is what's being criticized as ... well what did we really get what unruly can come out of this and he said it would be when when when one in Canada really achieve what do you say to the\nHe Canadian associate professor will now

heard the phone ring this morning five Sunni am five five did you think it could be the call\nNo of course the first reaction is what's wrong [laughter] and then my second reaction would be ... who would call it such a ridiculous hour and then then they say it's from Sweden so then you know\nAnd then so some point you got to hang up the phone and turn to your husband and say what\nWell even

the craziest day for us because you you're working your way you do all your everyday you're getting up you just you just put pushing that ball up the hill and then this comes\nAlong that have not exactly exactly it's right out of ... and now as it comes in silver is a big congratulations to you also for being a woman to win this because the Nobel Prize in physics has not been won by a woman in sixty five years is that is amazing how well did did you know that before you you learned\nI got I had never really thought about it you know so I I did not realize I'm I'm a big fan of movie I gave it Meyer who was the last one and um [noise] aside if this hadn't occurred to me that there hadn't been another one center\nAnd then the only one on the one before that was ... ... yes of course so\nI really shouldn't be lined up with those two incredible women but anyway\nWell you are\nA real good of\nBut you know it's interesting that we we spoke last month's with astrophysicist adjusts and Bill Burr now and she told us about being overlooked for a Nobel Prize she was she was one of the well a group of men and she was the only woman and they had developed this research and posters the men won the Nobel\nAnd she said to be when the press came to ask questions they asked him in about the science and they asked her\nAbout her measurements and her bra size and don't have any boyfriends isn't the late Nineteen sixty she was a scientist at that point did you ... did you experience sexism and in science in the course of your career\nNot blatantly no I mean you know along the way you know I I've been told by you know men that I did better that you know I've never been bitten by a girl or you know how could a girl get that kind of mark you know that kind of silly thing but I just I think it's silly when they say\nWell you must have heard the Italian prevents the al ... and at the certain conference okay\nI missed that I should find time to listen to it because I've been asked to comment on it\nYou should listen he said that this was invented by men and built by men and becoming a ... and that was turning against the men who invented it so this is your profession\nI see it and he just forgot to think of vote Marie Curie um you know I mean the fact of history that you know men did go to work and women stayed at home until there were more men you know that's just that's just a fact I'm but obviously once you've never you know obviously there's people that are making contributions and they should all be recognized\nAs talking about what you should be recognized for which is tripped pulse vacation what is that in ...\nIt's the fact that ah the time when we were doing this work you could have short pulse lasers or you could have high energy lasers but she couldn't have shortfalls and high energy because of that peak power which he won in order to maybe blow up an Adam and strip the electrons right off the Adam are molecule\nUm if you did it if you read a short pulse through your amplifier you would then blow up your amplifier\nSense of this is why it didn't happen and so what tripped false amplification did and it's a very simple concept\nIs the fact that we realize now you have to ... to the polls first which means you stretch the pulse to be many you know orders of magnitude longer but then you can go had an amplifier because now it just seems like a long pulse of amplifier\nNothing happens to the amplifier and after that then you can ... it also does not destroy the um stretch that you put on it it maintains it and so you can go ahead and compress it back to the way it was except with all the energy\nAnd and now it's ready for the experiment but that but that didn't layman's terms that's really how to get the shortfalls than high energy for the experiment but not inside the laser\nPens and this dramatically increased intensity of that post then that's right what what is it they will to do now that you were able to you did you accomplish that what what would it applications is that\n[noise] well of course many of the applications for scientific right so this is why we started to study just how molecules and atoms are ionized under the ... the fields in a bigger than what's holding the electrons to the Adams inside later field and so this was a new sort of paradigm to work and\nIt was a very few years after it was invented that somebody actually commercialized a CPA laser for eye surgery\nAnd this is you know the millions of people have had correct those laser eye surgeries and sister\nBut they don't all have to they don't want to use that million half yes it is a huge is probably the number one application I still\nLook come on you must be very proud of that\nYeah I mean and I found it amazing that um it happened and that so quickly happened and that yes\nAnd it's made a difference of so many lives that's what\nYou call you but I can only do that no I Know that you pay the way this side of the way the first one I've made I made it possible yes and ... and there's also a lot being made on Twitter that uh you Nobel winning scientist is an associate professor at water so when I'm\n... I'm very sorry I think the university has been criticized for that but I just something that for a flight\nYou know nobody told me not to know but you know I've had colleagues male colleagues here tell me\nI should you know it was time for me to be applying and I said yeah I'll get around to that but I just never did\nHe going to get on to it now\nI don't know my kind of hoping maybe the university's left and they'll just give it to me now when [laughter] I don't have a lot of flak they'll they'll maybe helped me fill out all the forms that has to be filled\nBy the Nobel winning scientist is probably a good enough reason to have to become a full time ...\nI just like to do things that I find ... they're not going to say I never found fun so that's why I didn't do\n... and again big congratulations to you so much things just making this\nBy provide\nWe reach associate professor Dona Strickland in Waterloo, Ontario she won the Nobel Prize in physics today is colonel mentioned in my conversation there are strict ones Nobel comes on the heels of\nControversial comments by Italian scientist almost sounds to me on the research organization CERN on friday Mr ... spoke at a seminar about gender issues in physics\nHe claimed those girls said the physics was quote invented and built by men it's not my invitation unquote\nYou also said male scientists were being discriminated against because of ideology rather than marriage\n... immediately suspended for his quote unacceptable remarks just Wade is a physicist from imperial college London she attended a seminar we reached has weighed in London\nThis weird what was the most offensive thing you are listening to professor ... speaking the other day\nI think that most offensive post the tokens to say that physics was invented by ... by invitation when actually women have contributed huge need to physics throughout the whole of history but for an incredibly long time we haven't documented auto stories\nAnd we have to be rainy castle because we have to remember that it was only midway through the last three that women were even able to graduate from writing prestigious universities like Harvard or Cambridge and so that kind of huge impact on physics is only just beginning to happen now\nThis wasn't just some off the cuff remarks that this professor made and the question period this was he gave a series of slides discussing ... can you describe some of the some of the presentation he gave I Know you were in the room for that\nSet presentation had obviously had a lot of time taken over it and they had done a bake analysis of lots of publications and looked at the track record of men and women comparing that kind of time throughout that Korea and showing the at the beginning of ... an amount of courage they have some a number of citations for different publications\nAnd then afterwards is deviated changed and men had most citations\nAnd that's actually a huge number of programs and the whole way of academic publishing at the moment that is a big bias against women and also against on west and people in the fast very ugly stages a pair of you\nAnd then after that that is by an ... site and you basically when you're writing out to a scientific paper you cite 'til you reference the people that you know the people that you're familiar with the people that you see at conferences and more often than not with men nuts men and they find men more often that she will say site themselves way more often than they cite women\nSugar from your neighbor I mean so that's really what we're talking about we're talking about being able to live together being able to function and work within our province so it's I think a lot of people have vested interest in throwing a you know random accusations that us I don't think it was entirely accurate to do stuff\nBut not just defense language test values tends to immigrants and that's that may be ending deportation failed that test that's\nActually the parental government doesn't have the power to deport so we\nNever ask a federal government to do it for you but we actually\nYou know we never said that we would ask the federal government to do that the reality is what we were proposing is that and it's just something that exists even if we're within Canada is that people who emigrated here are asked to adhere to Canadian values in general and that's the only thing that we were suggesting so we're not doing anything more or less than what the federal government doing on its\nOwn and they all are a little ... where where is there a test in a rousing had if your values Canadian values Tommy without that happens\nImmigrants that want to come to Quebec are off a series of questions about how life occurs everyday in Canada and our our position is very similar to that and we're asking them to adhere to basic values of\nA of Canada whether or not it's a quality of the sexes um do you do a\nSame sex marriage rights very basic things I think anybody who wants to come to Canada should know that this is a place that welcomes diversity and that's basically what the question that would involve anybody who wouldn't hypothetically past that I think that would be extremely rare considering\nAnybody who wants to come here is manifestly wants to integrate within our society at that point we would simply say that we don't we will admit the credential that's required Ottawa at that point\nA could could walk the walk on them anywhere and of course the charter of rights and freedoms would apply so I'm not overly concerned with that position and I don't find it took street and I don't think that we're anywhere near deporting and I think it's you know I don't think it's accurate to say that we could do that because provincial governments don't have the\nPower of the ... just to make the declassified this what we've heard San ... is it there would be this past would happen several years after the Iraq to see how we would have integrated in languages that not too\nSlowly ... that were very welcoming to immigrants\nAnd we want them to succeed him are going to be very flexible in the way that we in dispel the construction certificates and of course right now we're in the process of forming are cabinet the premier elect is looking into forming a his team and I think you know the new immigration minister is going to have the responsibility of\nClarifying exact rules but I mean I don't think that now is a good time to get into the details as\nTo what that would look like the future immigration minister is going to consult with about your crops within the immigration department consult with our federal partners to make sure that we have some good but to be cleared the Sikh wants integration to see a cue wants immigrants to succeed\nAnd we want to throw more money at making sure that they do succeed so actually I think our position is very open minded and I think it's in tune with what ...\nWhat about wearing religious symbols what restrictions will they be understanding the party would not want people in in the public service teachers to be wearing a over religious
