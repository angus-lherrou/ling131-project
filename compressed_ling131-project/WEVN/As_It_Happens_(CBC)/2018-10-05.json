grips with\n\nThe FBI probe is complete and today our by our US Senators from each party have had the chance to review the single and confidential copy of the bureau's report into allegations of sexual assault by judge Brett Kavanaugh on surprising\nVery differently here's what Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell had to say earlier today so what are we\nWhat are the facts and evidence tell us after seven and got to go to\nThe fact is that these allegations have not been cooperating with al ... been corroborated by the seventh investigation\nInto new FBI investigation\nSo none of these last night of\nAllegations have been\nCorroborated confirm Bobby shutting down layers beyond us to go to Sherman ... side of this morning new the new Judiciary Committee\nPhiladelphia could locate adding a third parties\nWho can attest to any of these allegations\nIs Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell speaking earlier today Senate Democrats had a very different take here as Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nWe're many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts having received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized\nCan't do know that his fiance did indeed say that he was worried about going to the conflict but that he had received assurances from his diplomatic\nI'm going\nAnd his fiance was waiting for him outside is that right\nCorrect waiting for him outside um he had\nGiven her several numbers to call if he did not come out again indicating that he was a little nervous about going to the consulate in the first place and that and uh he did not come out\nWhat did she do how long did you stay there\nSo she said it for several hours after\nThe conflict had closed even\nUm and even the next day he went back and went back with a number of other journalists to a demand has release my understanding is that um she is a not well over the situation\nBut again there are there have been reports of of journalists that have been gathering particularly the\nTurkish Arab journalists coalition that is gathering to um to pressure and and demand answers basically\nIs there any chance that he could have left him that she didn't know about it\nUm I I'm sure that is what is that is when what's on all of our minds\nRight now obviously I'm the Saudi authorities are maintaining that he left the conflicts and uh the latest statement and the thing that they're cooperating with Turkish authorities to try to find him on the Turkish official position from the presidential spokesperson is that\nThey have reason to believe that he is still there\nAs with all consulates in the local authorities who provides a police forces around the country to spot the the host country Turkish police who are on the security that the conflict they say they check the security cameras and did not see Mr ...\nLeave the building on foot but they do say that a number of diplomatic cars had been moving in and out of the conflict since Tuesday so it is that where your concerns lie\nI'm sure I think there's that and then there are just the concerns that frankly that we're hearing very very different and reflecting theories and explanations from the Saudis and the Turkish authorities\nAnd from our efforts at the at the post you know we really reached out to both um Saturday in Turkish authorities so we hope that uh the Turks can pressure\nTheir study counterparts for information and for answers I'm I'm sure it in an ideal situation a there are CCTV CCTV cameras and then you know show us the tapes if if the Saudis are saying it is true that a ... I'm actually to leave then there should be evidence of that\nWhy would Saudi Arabia take him I wouldn't be detained because she'll be\nSomeone who has worked with them and in fact I just saw him\nA few weeks ago here in Washington where he's been living for about the past year or so uh yeah it's been critical of of the Saudi Government and in particular the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nObviously this is all happening against the backdrop of a wave of crackdowns a dissent in Saudi Arabia\nA just a few days ago some of them out of the economist was\nCharged with a terrorism after being detained for nearly as well um women activists plenty of other journalists and clerics\nI'm so this is a singer malls and mystery surrounding demolish happening against this this backdrop and um you know we were publishing Lawrence's pieces and Arabic and I do know that that ah it's something that the Saudi authorities are sensitive to 'em but again I think what\nJamal always told me that he did not want to be labeled as a\nDissident or as a a an opposition journalist he really just wanted to write it off in a lot of his his work was even advising Mohammed bin Salman about\nHere's what I think you should do\nIt was formally or a royal family advisor at one point um\nSo uh it is it really you know quite stunning I'm quite studying to see what's been happening in the kingdom in general just sitting there and tolerance for dissent and could make them a target absolutely\nAs you point out he was formerly he was an advisor to the royal family so what what ... what changed and why why was he why did he turn against this particular regime\nSo and it has the very first piece that I I commissioned and edited for him last September um the title was a Saudi Arabia was always repressive now it's becoming unbearable\nUm he basically just saw a lot of his\nFriends getting swept up in the crackdown seesaw friend who's a being imprisoned or having travel bans a slapped on them and or the time you know he he wrote hound Saudi Arabia we deserve better than this and this is again a kingdom that is showing even under the ... conference\nAt total and tolerance for any sort of dissent or or criticism of their policies\nWe know what it is Mohammed bin Salman has consolidated his power he has as you point had arrested\nHundreds of clerics activists business people numbers of them were detained outside the country what became of them is there any record of people getting released as there is there a pattern that you might be able to give you hope to Janelle ... my my to emerge from this city is being detained by the Saudis\n[noise] um that's that's the difficult part again we know of activists sand and journalists and social media stars that have been held for months a year even before being a before being charged with anything so\nYes I'm very worried but again it's just very hopeful that keeping a spotlight on his name and on this case both scare us and abroad can can help for speedy resolution\nAll right we'll be watching herons thank you thank you so so much\nTurnover is the Washington Post global opinions editor we reached her in Washington DC\nIf you go into battle with Thelma keel either you're going to end up wobbling down your arms or she will almost certainly do it for you\n... is an arm wrestler and she is strong in her weight clashes ranked second in Canada with her right arm third with our left\nLater this month she was going to be taken both those arms to turkey where was she will compete against athletes from forty five other countries at the world arm wrestling championships we reached a kill in beach Burke Ontario\n... did you inherit your talent for arm wrestling I did for sure who did you get it from\nI got it from both my parents and my grandma\nAnd they were good at arm wrestling they were amazing it on my phone [laughter] did you wrestle them\nNot my grandma but my dad and my mom that for\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from revision energy a local employee owned company helping thousands of granted staters go solar\nRevision energy is currently growing their team of

him to be honest I I'd rather live better age\n[laughter] and you're you're not wrestling or because you're afraid to\nYes [laughter]\nSo you okay so obviously comes into your new inherited but when did you first get interested in competition in arm wrestling\nAbout Fifteen Years old actually\nConsidering how does that come about\nMy dad and I said well and my mom we were invited on this um was Alan hit man for he was doing a fundraiser for himself and he said I Will give off camera whoever can beat me\nAnd it's like whoa free camera right so we went in and my dad one the camera\nAnd they offered by parents to go and train with them but they didn't really know much about myself but I wanted to give it a shot so my dad got me into the practice and they saw a lot of potential and made their like yell at Fifteen Years old\nAnd your polling this much you ought to continue with this\nWhat did you think about when they told her that\nIt really was um something huge for me I never really had something as big as this for someone to actually take initiative and me is just a a very light in the dark cold basically\nWhat about what was the whole dark\nI I mean growing up I mean I I really hated my arms my ... big big arms and I never really liked it because you know dress it didn't fit right shirts didn't look good I was a world big kid and I just absolutely hated my act\nSee her liberal cabinet minister bill Blair yesterday he said that once marijuana is legalized ... as you mentioned to publish seventeenth he\nSaid that the liberal government will address this issue of criminal records in quotes and appropriate way and we heard Ralph Goodell a public safety ms minister while ago he said the government would look\nTo ways to make things fair so what does all that that that did you think the liberals are supporting your private members bill\nWe're going to find out because I intend to ask them on October seventeenth but honestly I Do hope they do and this is not a partisan issue I think if they characterize it as I Do as a justice issue I'm hopeful they'll they'll do it I think they could have done and should have done when they introduced the kind of a spill in the first place California brought in similar measures Vermont that\nBut I get that they're not saying let's wait until the bill comes into force\nAnd so I'm trying to use this private members bill ... as an effort to kind of nudge them to do the right thing I'm hopefully will\nBut if it seems likely that they are going to do what you're proposing then why not just wait for that why why make this noise now when it's likely just going to evolve in that direction anyways\nWell maybe you're more optimistic than I Am certainly talked about this and vague terms I Want to commit them to build this bill is gone through several drops with the same kind of legislative draft or who have worked for the the government\nAnd I'm hoping they'll say this is it if they want to tweak it if they want to improve it and run with it nothing would make me happier but I Do not want this to simply linger it seems to me an issue that needs to be addressed because we imposing burdens on hundreds of thousands of Canadians that simply should not have them going forward\nWe will recall that Stephen Harper government imposed mandatory minimum sentences in six months\nFor uh any pot possession of six plants or less a which I understand the number of people were affected by that we spoke with billions and you know that while ago who is a minister in that cabinet too was supported those mandatory minimum sentences he's now\nIn the business he says that pot is a wonderful therapy for people and it's a great business opportunity what do you say to those who supported this in the past and now see it as an opportunity for them\nWell I'm not going to comment on business decisions that they made and what some would see as a slightly hypocritical position I understand what you're suggesting but truly this has to be something that the liberals and conservatives support this is something that we should all pass ideally by unanimous resolution if\nPossible so we can write this injustice going forward\nDo you think that conservatives will support you Bill\nYou know I've talked to a couple of the mind the culture of the justice committee sort of dealing with the right people and uh I've talked to one so far and I hope that they will I think they get the basic point about the injustice and I'm hoping like me that they see that society has changed and things that might have been treated one way back twenty Thirty years ago\nIs treated in a very different way today we've seen that all over the place in other areas same sex activity there was an expungement bill of as you know in the last parliament that dealt with that and those people who had convictions for that activity I think although very different this approach is very analogous\nAll right we'll be watching this bank and thank you thank you Murray rank and he's the Indy ... justice critic we reached him in on a wall\n\n[noise]\nIn Nineteen Twenty one a white mob attacked prosperous predominantly African American neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma known as black Wall Street and it's been called the ... massacre and it has been described as one of the worst instances of racial violence in the history of the United states\nOver the years there have been suggestions that there could be mass graves in Tulsa on this week the city's mayor said it would be investigating whether that was in fact the case\nMichele brown works at the Greenwood cultural center handguns historical tours about what happened in Nineteen Twenty one we reach ms Brown in Tulsa\nIs brown long has it taken until no for an investigation like this to happen\nYou know that's a great question and I think that we finally have a mayor who is courageous enough to approach the situation in incident and to actually move forward and bringing the shape the investigation\nWe're talking about an event from Nineteen Twenty one of the spring of Nineteen Twenty one that meant that mobs white mob set fire to hundreds of businesses and homes whole city blocks hundreds of people dead ten thousand homeless\nAnd we don't know the whole story so maybe just to start off tell us how this begin began quite simply didn't\nIt did and it's a story that was all too common\nDuring that period the inflammatory accusation that a young black man\nHad a salted a white woman in an elevator in broad daylight in downtown Tulsa when he got into the elevator\nAs he did every day as a ... boy he was given special permission\nTo go into the Drexel building and get water and use the restroom every day he encountered Sarah page on the elevator this particular day after the elevator doors closed and Dick rolling insert page or alone there's a screen from the elevator the elevator doors open and Dick role and takes off running\nHis later arrested and taken to the jailhouse slash court house and\nThe accusation is made this our page had been assaulted\nAnd ask the story circulated throughout Tulsa throughout the day it went from claims that she had been assaulted to she was sexually assaulted by the end of the day they were claiming that she had been raped and this infuriated a mob of angry whites\nWho were determined to take matters into their own hands lynchings were all too common in Tulsa Dick world and was arrested and whites began together in front of the courthouse angry and upset about what had happened about forty black man approached\nThe courthouse initially I spoke with a sheriff at that time and offered to help protect the ... and he told them to going back to ... that he had everything under control and the problem would be fine so they did return to Greenwood but some estimates habit that there were as many as ten thousand whites that had gathered in front of the court house last jailhouse\nLater that evening angry and upset determined to take matters into their own hands and a group of about a one hundred black men returned and this time a white man approached a black man with a gun and so what are you going to do with that gone he said I'm going to use it if I have to and they begin to struggle over the gun and during the struggle that gun goes off and at that point they forget all about ... page\nThat's an all out battle in front of the courthouse blacks retreat to the ... district\nAnd whites slowly advance towards the Greenwood district eventually breaking through the barriers that African Americans had set up protecting their community but because they were so outnumbered\nAble to overtake the blacks and invade their community and when they do so they invade\nUm Killeen looting stealing and within a short day by the following day more than thirty five square blocks of property has been completely destroyed a thousand homes burned to the ground three hundred black on homes a three hundred black owned businesses completely destroy and not only were they were shooting but they\nWere also dropping nitroglycerine bombs from\nAirplanes that had been borrowed from a local oil company\nAnd this has been described in two thousand and one report by the Oklahoma commission to study closer race riots is that this was probably the only time that the United states has anybody community than bombs from the air\nThat is correct what\nDo we know about what happened to those those those those remains\nFor what we know is that the entire population of the African American community was ten to twelve thousand six thousand of those people were held in internment camps um\nThat left four to six thousand people on accounted for and we know that there were people that flat so there's no way of knowing exactly how many people lost their lives but we do believe that um the number is even higher than the three hundred that has been recognized\nWe do not know that there were several mass grave sites that were set up and a lot of that is based on\nOral histories and what we have been told from not only are survivors we identified a hundred and sixty two survivors in Nineteen Ninety six that began telling their stories\nBut also from whites that wanted to call and speak anonymously about the dump trucks that would drive through the streets of the Greenwood district pick up dead bodies and then go dump them in the Arkansas River we know that there was a mass grave sided Oakland cemetery based on the testimony of a man\nWho happened to be a young boy at the time that the riot took place and he was playing in the area when he saw a group of white men\nPiling bodies into an open plot at oak lawn cemetery and we did some preliminary investigative work there\nUm years ago and\nThat geophysical search a determined that there was a mass grave site that there was reason to believe that there was a mass grave fight when we were not given permission to do the archaeological work\nThat needs to be done um and so we're hoping with this new decision that I'm from the mayor to move forward with that investigation that we will finally be able to do a thorough and very complete investigation", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "05"}
