there's the bc judge who ruled earlier this year that keeping prisoners locked up alone for twenty two\nOf their constitutional rights\nUnder the legislation introduced today inmates will be presented with what is being called the opportunity to leave their cells for four hours each day reporters asked whether that is just a solitary confinement by another name here's what minister Goodell had to say\nIt is not a it is a fundamentally different approach or do you go to the to the definition\nOf what your nations would call administrative segregation or solitary confinement it's of those two hours that are the key threshold when you're able to provide more than that as we're going to be doing under this new system with the proper kinds of interventions this will lead to the accomplishment of two objectives\nKeeping the institutions and the people in those institutions including the style safe and secure but at the same time being able to continue the programming that will have the impact\nOf contributing to the long term rehabilitation of prisoners so the key question is are they going to be released in a condition\nWhere they have some prospect of a leading a law abiding life\nOr are you just going to leave them in a condition where they will undoubtedly reopened again and there'll be more victims and there'll be less safe community\nI don't know we don't know what happened to it every a leading a paper and journals opinion had been given the same tip off that that the Saudis were on the edge of doing that right before among my ... strip and we don't know whether Donald Trump told them not to do that which\nThen the cards in the fall so denied denied and I we don't know if this was a Trump led a issue or whether Mohammed bin ... himself and I think this is more likely explanation feels under so much pressure among his royal cousins and within the royal court\nThat if he is attached to this logo operation or not rogue operation his days are numbered in that role\nOkay the other element as you mentioned is the Turkish officials in what they're putting on so you got the possibility that\nThat a downtown and the crown prince and the king or trying to work out what the story is going to be but meanwhile the Turkish officials and not just the giving these other bits of information but actually coming up with photos in evidence that\nThey you mentioned the Sistine Saudi operatives who flew into is Daniel on the day that Janelle ... disappeared a and one of the ... and not the expert with the bones are\nSo what does that do to either the rogue agent as a theory or the botched interrogation theory\nIt makes it all a charade it it it makes it makes what we've seen\nYou know everyone who looks at this has and understanding of what likely occurred it doesn't matter if you're a Senator Lindsey Graham Senator Bob Corker Senator Marco Rubio all Republicans all think democracy Yogi was murdered but yet again the one single person not coming to that conclusion is the president of United States Donald Trump\nHas it come to that point where it doesn't matter ... we we know they're lying there saying these things you know it's not too and it doesn't matter that they line doesn't matter we're just going to at some point to that that still accepted this is what is going to be the truth even though everyone knows it's not and\nAnd Donald Trump and at the end the crown prince and the king just hope the world loses interest\nI think that as a gamble that they may be taking and Isaac would be a mistake on their part um I think it's very hard to imagine that Mohammed bin some on\nWill ever get an interview with any other global mainstream journalist and this not be the anchor of that interview where they start you know our own my own magazine the Atlantic Jeff Goldberg writer and chief get a very wide ranging interview with Mohammed known soft and saw him on when he visited the United states in Washington\nA recently I Can't imagine him ever having that opportunity again without being directly\nA challenged about um ah what Saudis ah allegedly did a against Jamal ... and having this part of it and that's that's the future that that they're going to have if you think that they can you know try to exhaust the world with this and turn away and act as if nothing had happened\nJust finally because ... was your friend to sit and said that he suspected he lives in this kind of danger\nJamal ... show the I've known him for a very long time\nI Can't speak for him now of course any more I don't think that he ever conveyed that he thought it was life was in danger story that we don't know we don't see is that there is grief inside Saudi Arabia there is frustration inside the royal court there's anger\nAround Mohammed bin some on that he put them in this position because they actually like than admired and respected ... much of what Jamal was doing even as he was criticizing\nUm their government on occasion but I think Jim all new and had reached a point where he felt the pressure points were so severe um I never had a talk with him about whether he felt unsafe\nBut I think he realized he needed
