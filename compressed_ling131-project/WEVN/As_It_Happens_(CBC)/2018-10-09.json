unstoppable sea level rises to ...\nLives that report comes on the same day that the Nobel Committee awarded it's prize in economics to two people who made the relationship between grow technology and climate change focus of their work their names are William Nord house and Paul Romer we reach Mr Romer\nIn New York who has a rumor congratulations thanks so much tell us about how you found out\nI heard the phone rang twice this morning just before six and I thought it was a spam call so I didn't even bother to try and answer\nBut I couldn't get back to sleep I started thinking well it's unusual to get spam at that time a morning so I thought maybe it was when my kids and then I looked and saw that it was from Sweden\nAnd I thought oh I better I better give them a call back\nAnd how exciting it to get that news\nBut the moment that was really I really started to feel\nExcited was I'd I'd check they told me you know and ... and I said but is it is it shared with anybody and they said yes it's with Bill ... house and then I was actually starting to to get happy because I think bill is a terrific choice and I've argued for a long time but he you know he deserves the price so that that made it very special\nAnd the reason why the two of you do you do different kinds of economic uh that do are it's combined together for your understanding of how economies can grow sustainably but from a different point of view right so\nThat's right they did a they were very keen to back up what they were saying at the time that was a ... port so rumors that that he was a abducted will being held\nThat point you get the purpose of this was to you know to to to make that case but he wasn't there so we did have a have a tour of the building as you say it's it's it's a pretty large building from the outside it looks like a regular that townhouse if you like it's a maybe a two or three stories but it goes there to three flaws subterranean for us as well\nSo we had a tour of the consulate from the the absolute basement weather's a prayer room where the sort of filing storage rooms\nI'm On the other five floors that include a ... a visa counters that include uh offices for officials were dealing with\nSaudi if as you know Saudi nationals who are in Turkey over the ... uh the counsel's office himself and other offices so we did have an extensive ... um the comfortable going round and cuts to sort of show look you know nothing to hide here\nUm but obviously we are a I'm a journalist I wasn't conducting a forensic such um I couldn't you know at the end of that to say you know there's there's nothing to be seen hit but but it was a very unusual move they said they've never done this before I'm a history of the concerts\nFrom that perspective it was you know I'm trying to go a long way to discount any accusations that ... was actually being held up to come to the\nMurder bizarre scene that must have been doing going around the coping cupboards no nothing that he's not here is not under the table he's at the back room I mean that's that is really strange\nIt's one of the more unusual assignments I've done setting the\nThe thing about Mr ... them saying that he's now here we don't have any hair he's not in Saudi Arabia it that doesn't exactly say that they didn't do something to him does it\nKnow that would that was simply somebody to say he wasn't a he wasn't out the concepts on Saturday afternoon when when we visited and that that window of this immediate signs of of anything untoward that\nThere are a lot of political tensions between Saudi Arabia and turkey so it does that factor into your your your questioning of the Turkish authorities and what they say happened to Mr ...\nIt's definitely part of the ... ... as you say that the ... not great for a number of reasons a president I Would want the government itself is a is poverty has its roots in Islamic Islamic politics took he supported a government in Egypt that was a Muslim Brotherhood\nGovernment in twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen or the Muslim Brotherhood is that the movement which the Saudis have decried as a as a terrorist organization\nSo that raw big political differences between turkey and Saudi Arabia president Edwin has has not gone a one hundred percent on sort of attack mode criticism mode of Saudi Arabia\nThat may also reflect the fact that Saudi Arabia is an important a very important country in the region it's an economic power\nUm it's more important country for a for Muslims it's home to Islam to how the science\nSo it will be I'm a very major escalation if if he came out officially publicly an openly and I made a very direct accusation against the king of Saudi Arabia um that it had deliberately killed a citizen in any stumble\n... Dominique I appreciate speaking with you tonight thank you thanks very much\nDominic Evans is Reuters bureau chief in Turkey we reached him in his temple\nOoh ooh\n\n\n\nI'm an effort on like the signaling on the highway or fixing climate change but there is at least one thing to do which we are extremely sincerely dedicated to\nMaking alcohol out of every single thing that we can make it from the most recent example distillers have found a way to make vodka straight from a cow's milk the product is called Moscow and it is the work of dairy distillery\nWill mean McDonald is the founder of dairy distillery we reached him in ... Ontario\nMay lead says a lot can aid from the cows no taste like\n[noise] ah it ... style while in my opinion teams fantastic it's imagined a standard vodka\nBut with absolutely no burn on the sweet smell and the uh current really finish leaving no burn a few big box of college date but a vodka elephant often has stood out to kill him sort of\nTaste to it which many people do like a ... when you drink it burns going down but ours has done to that it's a very smooth experience\nAs a tendency to nail polish remover right big [laughter] you were going to say [laughter] quite sibling delicately so what does it look like who looked like milk\nOh no it's completely clear just like a like a vodka Philip to Ninety four percent alcohol purity and then diluted spring water to bring it to ... percent alcohol so you could mix it with all your favorite cocktails but what people tell me what it says that it's good to sit on its own which is pretty rare and about\nIt and it just made this was a regular milk or or what part of milk is using can make the vodka\nSo we're using a ... called new permanent so what happens is the milk comes into the flu shots are from all the dairy farms in our case we're working with ...\nThat the largest airport sets are about an hour South Florida was the shops are taken off the lake fire and ice cream and then there was a skim milk and what they do to make it cheaper to ship the pro teams of skim milk they concentrate them by taking out the water and when they do that they also take out\nThe lactose minerals and vitamins and that liquid has called milk come yet\nAnd what's interesting is right now they have very little use for it and the vast majority of it is stopped and that's why we're turning into all\nThis ... this is their the farmers just get rid of it it's just think this is a waste product tens of knock the milk and cheese and and better protection\nStuff right I I don't like to call it a wave but it's something that's being wasted right now but uh but no sugar all the sugars\nIs Matt and Matt's right now the farmers actually have to pay for those safe disposable of this because flat closest harmful to the environment so it's an environmental problem it's a financial problem because if it costs to dispose of it also don't want that wants to see a good portion of what comes out of the cat waste\nHow do you turn it into alcohol\nAll that for a we worked with the University of Ottawa with a professor who live there in the biology department hired a yeast that can prevent a lot of ... most ... eat it but you know news team towels or as you will consume a lot to do some gardening south\nSudanese distilled in big vats like that like any other alcohol\nThat's right well it comes in we actually got milk truck that pulls up here are they pump it into our from it turns so we have a large still from after we filled up with ... or we pitch in our ...\nThey get to work with take about three or four days to divert the toes into alcohol then we put into our a student loans where we purify the alcohol right up to Ninety four percent and then uh we don't do that with water to make\nCoast intolerant can date drinks is\nOh that's a great question no not at all so the Big East will leave the lock those flew into their basic triggers an equal sugar it's absolutely no lactose is the final product\nAnd is it something you have to refrigerate\nI don't know at a at the end of it it's not the only difference would be made from er from\nSo and not the respects has just I've I've I've variations like it's like ... ... is that the state's new there is that the less nail polish remover and and do you drink it straight you mix it with something good what what what do you what are your recipes at this point\nWhere you can make said and we found that mixes are obviously very well with no sleep and look for in a also may increase which are so I think of a bally's part of one hundred percent but there is something we're working hard and and but also for the sit ins free feedback there's people like it just\nAll night so it's very versatile\nThey make a wet Russian I presume very white Russian [laughter]\nOf course you're talking about dairy because as a new trade agreement with the United states and what that means to dairy farmers they're quite upset about that is ... is something that dairy farmers can provide how do you think that that affects the dairy industry\nWell like for example right now the ... was the largest purchaser of voluntary are great at right now the alcohol in the outskirts of from there so\nWe can make this a popular we could become a a significant source of earth for for dairy farmers was mentioned orange is huge pressure right now so we want to support the dirt farmer ...\n[laughter] and and will you be exporting to the United states\nOf right now we've built to distort our sort of aren't produced probably for the alternative marketed drugs we get larger we'd love to sit this rubble\n[laughter] as I was as far as exposing myself to enter into possible dangers back then\nYou call yourself you said I'm I'm into nothing left to lose club I think you said denying TV\nRight right well there were a lot of us are back in the day I mean you know I was um I knew a lot of people who have lost children in the war and uh that's what we call ourselves\nThen you came to this point is it a forgiving housing collie and not immediately this is something that was it princess it took some months about half a year and you're describing that to us when we spoke to in two thousand and six and I just wanted to play a bit of what you said at that time\nAfter that it took a little bit of time I never asked for revenge against it that much but it took me a while to work\nOne day I came back to the university\nThat was a lot of Catholic I'm not a Christian [noise] very much of anything\nI've learned what let's just\nListen to thousands six Michael what did that going to teach you about forgiveness\nWell I think one of the biggest thing was that it taught me was that to forgive someone is not to condone what they did I certainly don't condone what what Cirque our dead\nBut it's basically I ... I Would say you know not to have admitted is process um the sister sister ship gal again are taught that corset ... said\nUm forgiveness is like quitting cigarettes sometimes you have to do it over and over again\nSo it's you know it's uh it it is a process and ah\nShe was just so great and presenting things in such a way that anybody could could accept them and explaining the nuances of the differences between condoning and forgiving and and other things that people\nOften confused and ultimately\nForgiveness isn't for the person being forgiven it's for the person who's doing the forgiving and it changed my outlook on life in general on my relations with people especially people close to me\nAnd uh you know it's it's it's still a tremendous factor in my life\nIs fair to say that that could change the course of your life\nIt's certainly did and it's very fair to say\nAnd Peter I I think it's safe to say that to interview Michael's words changed your life didn't [noise]\nUh yeah they did [laughter] I just kind of Mosul just listening to do it again and um I I mean it is funny just listening to it in today's times uh twelve years later and and realizing that that message is still more important than ever I'm at the time I was listening to Michael and as I was listening to this interview I [laughter]\nI just wasn't expecting the way that it was going to unfold and then\nYou know what I found out later in the interview that people call them a coward and had shot at him I just said I said hang on a second [laughter] even the the the message that this man is saying is that the most courageous brave choice I've ever heard somebody ever make and it felt like\nThe antidote to this escalating hatred that was was happening in the world and just listening to it again today I'm just like it's still the answer [laughter] it still remains the answer it still remains more important than ever so do you start\nBuddy you remember the details the situation in which you listen to to Michael in this interview\nYeah I was I was driving along in my car and and a Canadian musician spent a lot of time driving across Canada a lotta time listening CBC and and I would always listen to as it happens and\nAnd you know just one of those things that's on and you're listening to it and you're taking it in but it's one of those interviews that I just kinda zeroed in on as I clued into what was being said and and to me the part that I was very moved you know just by Michael's reaction in of itself I was very unexpected reaction\nBut what really kind of joke to me into action was was the fact that\nYou know like I said that people shot at him and and and called him a coward and just put him through\nEven more held and then I ... I don't have a son I don't know what it's like to lose one let alone under the circumstances that Michael last Nick I'm so when I found out that that people were doing that to him I just said that to me is just\nJust unconscionable and I need to do something about that in and I need to somehow amplifies message and and yeah the you know the context of it was you know ... or ... was this target and they were like hey we got him and be a victory um you know mission accomplished that kind of lingo and you know they were using\nA I mean I I I I don't want to speak for Mike on this but they were using Nick can the murder of ... or ... as as a reason to justify what they were doing it and yeah\nI and the lyrics of your son I'm just going to read the the course and they were going to hear it later on so people know they're not going to miss that so I guess I'm going to have to try forgiveness because men you know that's all that I got left my boy did not deserve this but neither do the best\nI guess in going to have to try forgiveness\nHow did those words continue\nThose words came to me right away [laughter] um I think I pulled over and wrote down those words and then\nAs is often the case for me was with writing I I kind of have the initial thing and then I knew I needed to be with that because sometimes the the sort of surface reaction is is not deep enough and I I immediately just cared about it so deeply and I and I knew that I was going to be singing and Michael's voice so I wanted to\nDo it properly um it wasn't just about channeling my own feelings about it I really want it to amplify his voice that was the goal so I wrote those words down and then I actually ended up seeking out to a copy of the interview that you guys had done and I I transcribed it\nI'm just so I could kind of practice putting words together in the way that Michael put words together and really than just kind of work from there and very carefully put it together\n... Michael ... when you first heard this on what was your reaction\nOf ours are reserve or call them ... turtle we overcome that um\nIn light of all the negative reactions though I had that someone would have such an understanding of what our men and bishops crime doesn't serve a generous and er\nThere's respect just over ... still does every time I hear it\nHe did his door yeah that\nWas the friendship based on was it just a moment it didn't do did you find do you took a too deep replace\nA lute who is a Knicks Knicks best friend organized to a concert and they created a scholarship and Nick's name they called it ... [laughter] and they are invited me down to come perform at concerts and so I went down to west Chester Pennsylvania\nAnd I I stayed in a guest room it leaks house where he told me that Nick would have spent much time and um [noise]\nAnd then we did this concert and I got to meet Michael we went for a coffee together in the afternoon and then I I play this concert and uh I stood on stage and in my view or next friends and family and teachers and Michael and um [noise]\nAnd I got to play the song and um I I my whole body shaking just thinking about that moment in and how touched I felt to be able to\nDo that in and contribute in that way and then several years in a row I went down in and did that and\nAnd then Michael and I were also invited to give a symposium on forgiveness at a at a college in Philadelphia and two thousand twelve and we got to spend even more time together then I remember going for a long walk together in a park and just just so enjoying our time together\nBut this I I Believe a generation difference isn't there I mean you would be closer to nix age\nAh yeah yeah I'm In my mid thirties so um I I guess about the same as Nick Goodwin is that right Michael Vick with the forty okay so pretty close I very young or you\nKnow sticking the singer songwriter Peter ... who wrote a song called forgiveness and inspired by an interview on as it happens with Michael Byrd\nOr imagined down near the line from Norfolk, Virginia is someone who forgave his son's killer in Iraq and uh I I I think we need to hear this song I think this plane the so I'm going to ask you to play it for absolutely\n\nYou asked me to explain it\nDoes everything and nothing to say ...\nSome things that happen and once they do then never go away", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Keene", "day": "09"}
