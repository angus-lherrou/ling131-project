Germany\nOf our housing stock is a privately owned that is a very very high a percentage and so we're going to have to move to more housing that is owned and operated by the nonprofit sector\nThat housing will probably look more or less the same but the way we run it will be very different it won't be based on on a you know making profit that means we can offer lower rent and then those buildings still make revenue so then we can use that extra revenue to put it into social housing which would be kind of welfare rate housing\nThat which we also desperately need because the number of homeless center city has doubled since two thousand five\nOkay now you've also said you'll triple the empty home tax why do you think that will be effective\nWell the previous council did bring in a one percent tax on empty homes and we know it's starting to fill units that were just purely being speculated upon really empty condos essentially are they are starting to fill up now is as the owners try to ah\nYou know avoid the tax but we want to accelerate this as well and actually we're finding now that some speculators are selling their condos to folks that want to live in them so the the taxes are proving effective and tripling it will uh just amplifies that affect them is\nNow the race which really very tight\nUh your main rival can send has not even conceded and assuming he doesn't request a recount he'll be presiding over not just a divided council but a divided city I mean how how are you going to push forward with these housing policies without consensus on council or or in the city more broadly\nWell or as an MP for seven years I actually managed to kind of the unsinkable as I got to measure passed through the house of commons even though it was opposed by the sitting majority Harper government which was to bring electronic petitioning to Canada\nSo I have experience working across the aisle others this kind of joke that I was the most popular MP and all parties but my own because I Would work so often across the aisle so I'm very familiar with how to do that uh\nYou know I was ah I I wrote a book with Michael Chong last year a who's a conservative MP and that was also arrested a\nWith a lives with me trying to stop the Kendra Morgan pipeline so I have worked across party lines often as an MP and I know I can do that in the city council have already had some great conversations with counselors and not really paying attention to what party they were elected with\nAn estimated two hundred and sixty five people have died from overdoses in Vancouver already this year your predecessor Gregor Roberts and called for the decriminalization of some drugs for safety supply and that is making available clean drugs that aren't team ten what will you do to address the opioid epidemic\nWell I Know Gregor was on the right path the problem is he didn't have a provincial or federal government at least under the Harper regime that was all responsive to specific requests from the city\nSo I think I've said that I Would strike and emergency task force with a health care professionals and first line responders to give us immediate steps that we can take\nAnd then it's my job to help go and get that implemented so that would be to for example talk to the federal government about getting specific exemptions from the criminal code to talk to the provincial government boats some specific health care funding and to really focus on what I've been advised is the best step forward is this a substitution programs\nAnd new ways of uh distributing these substitute drugs\nNot just one last question a voter turnout was thirty nine percent that was down from last election what are you going to do to make people feel like it's actually worth showing up to vote\nWhat we have the worst electoral system in the world here it's called an at large system give us an import from the United states are no other city major city in Canada uses it and in fact it's been struck down as discriminatory based on race and\nSo I've said that this will be the last time we uh we use this type of system you can't believe the ballot is literally it falls off the edge of the table that so long because everybody is included on it we don't have award system like you'd have in Toronto or or in Montreal\nAnd so we have to change this for ... for the electric to understand what's going on I think they're as\nClose to two hundred names on the ballot without really much information about who to vote for so this does have an impact on participation and we have to change it it was very especially for me as an academic at Simon Fraser university so this is well I'll be working with the province to get the changes here\nOkay Mr Stewart thanks very much

a kind of how we do our marketing doing these scenic shot just to kind of attract more attention to our firemen ago\nSo it's a form of advertising absolutely so can you describe some of them to me\nThe last ones we took a we're at a\nAt would islands ... where the ferry\nConnects pie I Know of Scotia and uh we tried to get a picture with the couch with a fair in the background and and we got a really good picture of that and then we did a few more understanding what the White House and\nIt was a really hot day that it was one of the hottest days in the summer so the\nCows kind of overeating on it so we decided to take her into the into the ocean I\n... and the cooler often\nThe photographer so this amazing ... shot and she screamed hold\nThe calorie care and she ran into the water with her camera and uh she took that amazing shots at getting a lot of the country now\nThere is also one super models\nThat there is also one in front of the the provincial legislature will lie there\nIt's well it's a it's a trademark of parents are now and then Charlotte town and\nYou just showed up on Saturday morning so we just went and took the picture and it turned out really good friends are out on the full of beautiful spot so we've tried to cover the island and um the pitchers so\nNow when you're taking the photographs of the cows and ... what what kind of reaction is that as well is it some of the people around\nUh they love it uh we usually do it during church tourist season so there's always a\nWe're doing and then they they just admire it and they asked to take a pet ... and stuff like that so yeah it's kind of it's pretty neat reaction we've done sunrise shots and the beach in the morning and uh we've walked by a couple of sleeping on the beach and they kind of woke up with a\nPretty big surprise but it's pretty neat stuff\nThat was much more instead of a romantic shot\nYeah that was the sunrise it turned out really nice\nSo it's sort of challenges a digital photography for having taking these pictures I mean you know you're not exactly as you say working with top models\nTo keep the cows attention is pretty hard because there's a lot of things going on which there are there out of their comfort zone or when they're on the east and uh but most of them are show so they're very well trained and a\n... a Halter broken and everything but it's just to uh\nYou know you get me to look at the right direction she loves to get through years pop pop the head and stuff like that or she is she's amazing Vicki Fletcher she she's been doing it for Twenty years for us and\nThis is your ... she's one of the best and uh probably one of the best dog in the world prompted you to do this\nWe've been doing it for Twenty years um people have done it before New Year's you read magazines out there that we tried to get the cover of right so that's how it started I Believe and uh\nSo now we just kind of do it for fun every year and a couple of times here will it'll work out on a trailer and we'll go for drives everywhere we go where we end up\nHave you ever thought of doing account calendar\nCalendars or I don't know if anybody buys calendars anymore but I think we'll do a coffee table book out it was kind of what we're thinking of doing so\nBut here's what I remember and want to apologize for and he laid out three ... three specific incidents that he recalled and ... and including the people who were there who had witnessed two of them\nAnd were these old incidents that you had clearly remembered as well\nRight so that was the one of the extraordinary things about this email was I had not recalled\nI'm to the incidence he mentioned so one was the incident that I had written about in the column which was um it was a ... I was groped in the back of the car there were two other people there um and the other two were not anything I had remembered\nOne was another groping which had happened at a at a dance\nAnd the other was um [noise] he had said he had kind of a close the door and a bathroom while we were in their together and it would not let me out until I kissed him which he said I did\nSo I wrote him back and said you know I I don't remember these things I Believe you but I don't remember them and I felt it was really important each and kind of ironic if you think about it that I felt I needed to say to him I Believe you\nKnow in the course of the me too movement which is just a bit over a year old now we've seen many men apologize after being public ... and for you what was it like having this experience of someone apologizing without having been named her shamed or in some ways sort of forced into it\nYeah so so there are two things about his apology one was um ... and this really did hit me with the fact that she did not have to do this I mean he could have\nAnd I wrote this in the ... the follow up piece that I that I wrote he could have read the piece recognized himself and thought I Wonder what's for dinner tonight\nYou know and and he could have been quite confident that I Would move on with my life as I have for the past Thirty years and not you know really talk about it anymore and he didn't have to fess up and also the kind of\nTone and content and his apology was\nIt was exceptional it was complete vulnerability he did not say you know I did this thing but I and I I was just a kid or I didn't know any better or that's just how it was back then he said\nI did these things he lifted them very very clearly\nSaid I have no excuse I feel terrible I have thought about this in the intervening years I've always wanted to reach out to you and apologize and he just said I'm Sorry\nYeah well and obviously he you know there was a level of trust with you and for him to be able to do that on some level I mean one of the things that struck me um in in reading your column about this is you don't say whether or not you accepted his apology\nTo be their last line in in in your column and when you receive you're talking about receiving the apology and you you're right and that is something I can guarantee I won't forget\n'em why did you choose not to let us know when and of course I'm curious do you accept his apology\nYeah so I I Do accept that I Do accept it and I think that's a big way forward in terms of the me too movement I don't think all women need to need to let all men off the hook for their actions and\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from community minded Fenton family dealerships serving king ... and all of

the Canadian men's record time\nWhen camel Evans crossed the finish line at the Toronto waterfront marathon yesterday\nHe not only completed his first marathon he smashed a record that had been on the books for forty three years Mr Eleven's time two hours nine minutes twenty five seconds was forty four seconds faster than the Canadian men's previous record it to our ten minutes nine seconds\nWhich Mr lemons sat incidentally after recovering from a serious foot injury this morning camel Evans spoke with Matt Galloway hosted metro morning CBC Toronto about the record performance\nAh I'm I'm a little beep for sure especially uh just the early turnaround are leaving this morning but I'm looking forward to a bit of a break here and I'm sure I'll feel great after a couple of weeks\nGoing into this race this is your first marathon you had had a great career before this point but a marathon is completely different um what were your expectations\nI knew I was a very fit and uh I thought\nIf things went well like it a good time maybe get close to that record but it's like you said the marathon does it for the east and they're just so many things can affect it outside of your control and especially being the first one I just it was very very unknown to me\nWhy did you want to go from running shorter distances to running the marathon\nI think it's a natural transition for a lot of this the athlete myself running the five game techie on the track but for me I had a very serious surgery on my left ankle in middle of twenty sixteen\nAnd um I actually had some difficulty doing track where it goes from that point on just handling the corners of track\nAnd so it was just sort of a natural fit that I could do the work outs that the marathon required a little bit easier it was just easier on my body as a result I just ah really took to the training and as a continued on I I Love the corporation and I'm like hook now\nIn that recovery me you had as you mentioned serious injury um do you run for a long period of time where are you concerned that there was a point that maybe you wouldn't be able to run at all I\nDon't think I ever faced that but I think that was very serious concern with the surgery I mean you can never do you want to come back from something serious like that back can't be an option but I I had serious goats at different points in recovery vote whether you want it to continue to do this you know it's very hard road to come back from\nThis record drone drains record stood for forty three years and people have gotten close to the records they've almost beat in the record and then because of\nThat it's a long race and anything can happen some things have happened in it's falling apart at what point in the race yesterday did you start to think seriously that you might have it and you're saying\nThe reality is I didn't know exactly how close I was into the last few kilometers and I have you with an absolute certainty that I had it with the five hundred meters last but up to that point it was\nAnything could happen I can completely blow it but yeah by that point I was definitely just enjoying it then\nThat was runner now marathoner can

and and where are you studying up in your own mind what your pace would be at that stage\nUh yeah my my plan was to run it it's hard to talk for a while not filed but a while on the five minutes from out of from the beginning a\nFirst five plus they give you time uh every five kilometers mark and sort of you who to warm up like let the system warmer broccoli and then also do find out from the time
