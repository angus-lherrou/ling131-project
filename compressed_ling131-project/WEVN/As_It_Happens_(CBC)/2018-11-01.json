accusing her doing something over a couple of laughter doesn't\nYes see I had a dispute with someone working on the field and as a result of that dispute that person\nAccused her of committing blocks from me and it took him a bogus accusation to the civil courts five days later with five witnesses\nAnd did you need is cleared out your desk at that point\nAh if I left and he was from that day that was on Monday and then um you know for the next twenty four hours or so I had uh\nShe was with my wife and and other people I trust and uh I went back on the on the Tuesday and I clean at my desk\nAnd went to see you like to do that ... you were there if they go for eight years lose you'd like to walk and\nIt's it's not ... it's a it's a hard position to get to see what the journalists of color um to get a job at a at a prominent publication particularly in print in this country and so\nIt's not a decision to be made lightly you know I I'm not an incredibly wealthy person Soviet they'll offer the paycheck is going to be felt but I I mean ultimately I didn't think that I was really making any sort of difference in the area that as if most important to me and if and if that was the case then what was the point in staying on\nThe road to in this article what about the newsroom did not matter\nYeah that was the feeling that I had and then I think\nOther journalists of color have that you know we have these experiences and these insights that we bring to the table but we don't feel you know seen or or hurt or or or understood perhaps and that can be a real struggle\nAnd ... and more than maybe it was ugly I mean this is something you you walked out of your job because it just burned you so much that this was the case in so we have what have you heard what are you hearing some other journalists of color about your experience the globe\nYeah systems I published a piece on Monday I heard from\nDozens of journalists of color at a vast majority of whom work in this country and they shared the same experiences of not feeling as though that represented and not feeling as though their voices are valued and and you know some people have left\nJobs over at some people have taken on different roles just we don't have to write and so you know what I've heard is that the struggle is is a lot more widespread for journalists of color then people might might recognize\nYou've worked as a journalist who ten years and you write in this piece that you say there are solutions that are pretty obvious what are they\nYeah I mean I think sometimes there's a tendency to talk about this issue as\nThough I'm well how are we going to fix it up very complicated but actually I think it's actually very simple I mean you know you hire more people of color you hear their voices and and trust them and empower them to to report on what they see as important and you know you elevate them to positions of power prominent so there are people of color higher up in the chain who\nCan shop you know stories and I had to help with their framing and I just think that the solutions are are fairly obvious\nThat what do you think's last with your departure I mean at some level you thinking well maybe I should stay and fight the good fight and that if you leave then you know you'd just once you have people of color in unions and\nYeah I mean I think that sort of part of the struggle if you leave you can feel like you're letting other people of color down and that's one less voice to fight for you know the issues that you've you as as important but I think to me ultimately I felt I wasn't really providing not much help anyway and that my efforts have been\nSort of few tile and so it was probably time to go but I just I didn't make that decision lightly\nSunny ... de ... speaking

response before we went to air you'll find more on this story on our website CBC ... a I H\nMm\nMm\nMm\n\nWhat if somebody took your average paperback and shrink it to roughly one quarter inch size and then turn it linked wise I made the words read horizontally so you could put the pages up instead of left or right or left to right\nCongratulations if they did that you have a device as the books are known in the Netherlands\nSupport for any ... live stream comes from you our listeners and from Congress regional visiting nurse association\nA home health in hospice agency serving people of all ages more than forty one communities discover how the conquered regional DNA can help you remain independent in your home and live life to the fullest\nDid it the RV an A. dot org\nBacks in your hands\nAh they were pretty much a revelation to hold in your hand or you can explain then describe them as we've been trying for a long time but when you really hold one there is just a perfect balance of design and mechanics and they feel like something really special when you see them for the first time\nI have to say when I haven't had one in my hand because I just saw the images today but it looks like something whose time has come we should have come a long time ago\nWe hope so well and they have been doing the amazing ... and the Netherlands for so many years and they've been introduced in various countries in Europe but really in in their home countries where they've done the best\nAnd it it really is astonishing to me that they haven't made their way over to North America yet but I'm delighted to to bring them here\nAnd they they really are sort of an answer to a question I think a lot of print readers have in terms of\nJust the portability that were used to in our lifestyle but with the luxury of print that so many of our readers we know prefer\nJust to I Know it's hard to do because you do you see them you can't have that kind of oh my gosh yeah of course yeah as as best you can you describe what one looks like for our radio ...\nThere there are several things that make them really special in terms of construction so they're really not just teeny tiny books shrunken down a they're a horizontal format which you can tell when you're looking at it and so they're very genuinely easy to hold in one hand and flip the pages\nThe spine is not a traditionally so inspiring it as a hinged fine see can truly flipped the top open and hold it more or less flat fee you have the horizontal aspect\nPlus the sort of top to bottom horizontal reading of the flaps fine and the hinge and this ingenious flee special ... paper that's just paper thin but has almost no show through and super sturdy\nUnder that when it's closed it's about the size of a smartphone\nYeah it was almost it is almost the exact same size as my smartphone so in in the case of some phones smaller in fact a little tiny bit sicker but easy to slip into a back pocket or even a front pocket\nSo it really is a pocket book I was wondering why they call them pocketbooks I never had a positive yes and the taxes and two small\nThe text is not small at all it's not shrunken down really so\nWhen we went into it we broke down the text I worked with my art directors here I'm at the end we redesign those pages of paying attention to\nLie in town and space thing and the best fonts you could really read it so we worked really hard to be able to have a comfortable reading experience that's the same as almost any print book and the trade\nBut now that the paper is different because in order to have as many pages as you would for a book you need to use a different type of stationary we would describe that for us\nIt is a very similar to and in fact is um it is like Bible paper um the publisher the printer that we work with and the Netherlands is historically by trade a Bible publisher and this is an innovation they came up with many years ago\nSame thing paper but they get it from this one single male and Finland I Believe where it is reinforced so it really doesn't or if it's quite sturdy\nUm we had a a laundering of one of them in my household my son left one in a pocket which most folks would not survive and yet came out a little soggy on the other side but the paper was completely intact so they can put up with a lot\nSo they've been used tested they ask then you test did they have made a trio an adolescent boys laundry\n[laughter] but and which is a good thing because you're the first of these books are going to be for a young adult readers is that right\nYup we're launching what John Graham with for us has feckless titles and he is you know his historical young adult author though his readership is very broad and crosses a lot of demographics and one thing we know about young readers and which is across the whole spectrum of people who read our titles is they really love print\nBooks we know that they are looking for print title if they are not migrating to eat as some adults have so we know it's something they're looking for\nWhen we know that people would turn to the readers because it had that Compaq nature and that was easy to just carry uses light\nBut then people were then returning to books but getting frustrated sort of caught between the two world so are you suggesting that this is something that could be so happy compromise between the compact ability even a reader and and the the tangible thing to a book\nThat is definitely the hope that um it it is definitely true that is not particularly hard to carry around a paperback but the reality is that the ability that you could slip in a pocket or handbag her purse or a tote you know book lovers like to always have a bucket their side um it's\nA great way to have a book with you there just perfect for travelling at all the amazing to see how people use them traveling and we know that that's the way they've worked before so\nAnd what did they found a new as your imagination pigs in what are the possibilities those Hollis planet that could be life as we know it could be people would be the animals that could be things I guess\nThat's all sorts of possibilities or the other hand you know you look at this positive thing and you think well this is what could happen but we are always making assumptions and I always I'm afraid of assumptions if you assume\nThat whenever a plant and us in a habitable zone as small as got water life starts then there should be life throughout our galaxy but then we would have a problem with the Fermi paradox right for him he said well there's you know life all through the galaxy why hasn't contacted us [laughter] I Know there's\nThere's two aspects here one there's so many planets a habitable zone\nThat might have a life\nAnd yet we have heard from none of them so it's a big puzzle that we've uncovered as well\nThat we tried to contact them I don't think we've done that [laughter] well maybe that's the problem that is right that might be the problem can you just take us back to the day this launched march of two thousand and I what was that like to do that long to what was it like to be there\nWas absolutely marvelous to actually see this big rock and see the you know our space telescope on top of that that was marvelous and I had an opportunity I was told you could be in the control room bell and his is a A R name when we're ready to fire\nOr you can spend your time with your family watching the launch well away from the launch\nI'd spent so much time away from my family building that mission I said no control room would be a wonderful experience rather be with my family and so my family and I and some of our colleagues for the measure were sitting there watching this magnificent missile\nWas plume of fire ... going to try it was absolutely marvelous I used to give talks about how wonderful that was that night was the most exciting night of my life\nAnd to my wife said no it was the second most exciting I your life\nYou were there for the most exotic ... I Would presume that you got married however you interpret [laughter]\nBut you will which is over the years and people said you know what we had a lot of pushback and and you you resisted you people now good credit you with having done that you hadn't been so resistant wouldn't be there\nYes we ... we proposed five different times you know only the fifth proposal was accepted it takes a tremendous amount of work and I'm from a lot of people to put together a spacecraft proposal Carl Sagan was one of our members are team members I don't know if you remember Carl Sagan of course\nAnd every time we would fail I Would ask all the team members do you want to try again and I had a letter from Carl Sagan yes yes I Want to try again I think it's a great mission and I'll be feeling better soon\nA few months later yeah die of his letter on my wall\nSo the Kepler telescope is now retired and I understand the NASA's project called Tess his launch this is the satellite is going to be watching those dollars\nIt's actually on orbit it's actually sending data back down and they've already found several planets\nIs there was a discovery class mission it was a probe into the galaxy\nOur plan is common or rare earth common or rare\nJust give us those numbers so we can build new missions\nWhich is what captured yet now test comes along and says well let's look at the whole sky and find the closest planet to start the plants around the closest stars and so we can examine them\nBut it James Webb telescope and we can examine them with ground based telescopes the new big telescopes coming online and find out more about these individual planets so that's the next step in our exploration of our galaxy\nSo exciting ... appreciate speaking with you thank you\nYou're most welcome by ... by\nWilliam ... is a retired NASA scientist he was the principal investigator for the Kepler Mission we reached William ... near Mountain View California [noise]\n\n\n\n\nFirst time

was fifty six years old\nMs gates was known for her idea to speed up coral evolution and create stronger Reeves her goal was to breed what she called super coral coral that could withstand the effects of climate change\nBack in March twenty sixteen ms gates was on this program to speak about that super coral here's part of that conversation\nWe're approaching this um it is true attempt at a young girl a time as the sister that pollution and what that really means is accelerate seeing what nature does\nI'm On a longer time frame and the countries do that in a shorter timeframe and there'll be ... to do that is that the climate is changing much more quickly than coal can keep up with so\nWe do that really through using things like selective breeding when we will will identify the most resilient oil resistant calls on the reef fan and and really read the calls that we have offspring\nThat happens best genetic underpinning for for future resistance just stress and we're also using conditioning experiments way we really are trying to\nExpose calls the conditions of the future if the goal of\nTriggering the memories the epigenetic cough ways that will then ultimately the cost down from generation to generation\nBut then this is a kind of survival of the fittest\nAbsolutely and so I think the controversy there is that that means that if we encourage survival of the fittest we reduce the diversity of those girls are the ones that aren't strong and can't adapt to these conditions that we ... upon them aren't going to survive\nWell and if we do nothing that's exactly what the outcome will be and I think that that says with a pulling back from the context about what we've observed and we continue to observe but to a colleague sitting Nineteen Ninety eight\nSent off to wilt three in a single warming event that is enormous so obvious fact it is if we stop and stand back and just let things take that course we will have the most severe genetic narrowing the last ... the\nEntire collapse separate systems and I'm not willing to tolerate that and so as a biologist I'm going to throw everything I can possibly throw\nThis problem and and off the question can we come
