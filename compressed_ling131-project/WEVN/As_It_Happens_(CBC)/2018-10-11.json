happen how would how are they are no warnings what what are you hearing\nWell it was a thunder storm last friday and south of the Yucatan and then Saturday morning it was a tropical storm and I was not that concerned at that point but I have a number of boat captains that became very concerned\nAnd they said this is one that we need to watch\nAnd by Sunday Morning it was almost panic bill with

is a kind of a an for minutes between the two governments but there's also kind of friends with both sides have been careful to maintain cordial relations\nThere both important regional players and I think they both feel a need to continue to get along and really is quite inconvenient for the Turks at for president or to want\nTo have that rupture now because Saudi is a it's a pretty big trading partner and the economy is in trouble already so there's not much incentive for him to be picking a fight\nWe know in Canada what it is to take on Miami had been some on and uh has had quite a desktop with him was in fact Mr ... he wrote about that\nBut why isn't the rest of the world responded dismissing the U.S President Trump saying he's concerned that Mr ... hopes his allows sort itself out what message does is that sending to the Saudi royal family\nWell I think today that President Trump spoke at a little bit more strongly at a little more supportive leave the Turks show the pressure

customary his citizenship ceremony took place three hundred and fifty six meters\nUp in the air we reached Marlon Blake in Toronto nine and first of all congratulations and becoming a Canadian citizen\nThank you thank you [laughter] why don't you want to make Canada you're huh I guess\nBecause I'm ... though is a very um it's a growing economy um there are lots of opportunities the country is very diverse and like all over the last ten years or more Canada of the immigration system where they're welcome immigrants so those are some of the reasons\nWhy I thought um Canada would be a very good place to live\nAnd ... and when and when did you when did you come here from Jamaica\nWhat I came in April ... fourteen\nDid you bring a family no no I came along and have you started this man he's you know why look as good alright bachelor alert here he\nIs but you you became a citizen and style didn't she's I mean you\nYes yes yes it was amazing it was better than I thought that I ...\nI tell people to describe how you did your citizenship ceremony way you did your oath\nWell I did it on the scene ...\nWe were actually outside in the open um there was like a like a grill or assigning the grill on the edge of the ... which is oval one ... one hundred and sixty feet above grown\nAnd the guy ask us to actually embark on the ... which literally\nWith a with the people for a toll on the edge or leaving embark on then the minister and the judge\nThey read the oath and interview repeated it after them and then we sing the national anthem was a great\nOkay it's just walk through this again so you're at the top of this ... hour you've got some kind of a harness on right after ... then ... ... what's his heart is on you lean\nThat lead Bach they're both a buck thought to like so so I felt like I was actually in the in the year ... ... you're not freaking out\nWell initially um actually they ... they are supposed to practice run for us right um so individual and then um what did it as a group after\nThe there were six of you who are doing your citizens that yes yes yes so I mean I you know what people say that it's nervous makes\nMemorable enough just to do it why should she wanted to do it at the top of this the entire leading out into space\n[laughter] well actually I didn't know [laughter] I wasn't sure oh exactly there are going to do it like um that that part I've tried to me by surprise and\nYou don't know I didn't know what I didn't I didn't know that we're going to lead Locke writes I thought it would just like stunned but then they asked us to talk about what they were fine\nBecause by the time we were there for at least ten Fifteen minutes so um before we actually went into it they actually did all this safety first Egypt is checking all those stuff so they check to ensure that everything is secure secured so I think that kind of up to get a lot more comfortable\nAgain I mean people who do this is both I've not done it and I know people who had its credit memorable day last year [laughter] so you didn't have to do much to make it a special one for you why did you agreed to be one of these people\nWere actually um when I went to do the test in September right um and then after the test\nUm they call they called me for the interview so when I when I gave her my documents on my id\nRussia was revealed that and then she asked me if I I'm an adventurous person so I said yes then she asked me if I've ever done a bunch of jumped and so I told her no she asked me if I Would do it though they're not sure and then she asked me if I have a\n... that sent the Adwok and I told her no\nAnd then she asked me if I were interested settled or yes I'm I'm okay with it\n[noise] who were the other people you are out there with\nWhere they were from India one was from India one of those from Iran Ukraine\nMuch faster than you can kind of that because of the technology here it's I mean we have now for cause actually woodworking mocked\nBut I Can't see you compare um Denmark in Canada and the differences of driving a car really considerable but something that is quite similar is a distance we are as you are from food sources during the winter from fresh produce or whatever\nAnd one of the plans and part of the plan in Denmark is to get labels on to food in supermarkets that show is climate impact of what this sounds like something that is ambitious as well is it not\nIt is it is it is invasion studied very much depends on how it's being done this is a real ... so you could actually come scare sample a neat a written meat compared to to ... so you can actually do a real\nComparison when you're doing your your your grocery shopping and so it it depends on how it's being done we're very positive about doing the rations on food because\nWe need to change the way we eating as well we need to be much less meat and fat and lots more vegetables it's an interesting idea and compare it it depends on how it's being introduced\nYou know the the the issue and you say that you don't care what other countries are doing you don't get what you want them to do the same time it is they're not a problem with you you were way ahead of other countries I mean we hear this in Canada we hear this elsewhere saying well\nWhy should we be way out there doing something we know that she's not doing the same thing so I Would you do you expect some pushback from Danes on this\n[noise] no actually we can see a population which actually say now that the climate is it ... the agenda that is that that's\nA lot of things saying we need to to move on this and if everybody is sitting waiting for somebody else why should we do something when Trump is is it's leaving the powers that be and why should we do this cat out of this up to ...\nWe need to see just said to ourselves and especially as politicians I Am saying that's again with the with the un recall in mind what could we do how big steps can we take and then let us be an inspiration and also a a case other countries can learn from\nThat if if you're saying Denmark isn't going fine now where does that leave while he just mentioned counting the U. S. where there's a president that denies that climate changes even happening so what we're we're we're we're we\nI was just about two years of what of using it in Canadian radio but but but it is serious now but also the positive side trade is actually in the recall it says we have an open window to act now and we need\nCitizen to tell their governments that politicians they like the politicians you need to act now by me because we we we have to do all the difficult things\nTo say and curiosity you got me wondering what does the word that you decided you couldn't say on Canadian radio\nIt was just we\nHad got it okay thank you built by five\n...
