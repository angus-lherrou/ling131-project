I Want to ask you about that because the prime minister says he's prevented from offering details but that there would be penalties in the billions if you cancel the contract what's your understanding of what the true price would be\nI don't know I have never been given any access to the contract um but um he knows what is in that contract and I think that people should also recall that there's only a year left in the contract so the question is how many vehicles are are still to be shipped\nWhat is the nature of the vehicles were not even sure that they're all labs\nAnd the fact that he knows yes terms or confidential but she knows on Monday he said it was going to be a billion dollars on Wednesday he said oh well a a billion dollars\nA was just a figure of speech and now he's saying possible penalties in the billions a plural so um it it's very very unclear but\nWhat is clear to me is that\nAs signers of the international arms trade treaties\nWe have an obligation not to sell to human rights defenders and the world is going to come after us and and make us live up to ... at the same time these workers\nMust be protected and I want to see a transition I Want to see something in black and white that is not confidential from this prime minister in regard to how he is going to protect these workers and make sure that they have the ability to support their families\nIf there's only a year ago and only so many left some of these armored vehicles to deliver what makes you so confident it's worth paying the price moved him to billions and penalties\nWhat price would you pay on twelve million lives twelve million people are expected to perish in the next year because of this war that the Saudis are waging we have to stand up and say uh this is wrong\nNow earlier this year though you weren't calling for those expert permits to be canceled you wanted them to be slowed down ... how did your mind changed on that\nWell I'm In terms of um well what was going on a I think that there needed to be clarity and it's interesting\nTo talk to you know what was going on in Yemen\nYes what was going on in Yemen and there have been reports over the last a while and speaking with um with representatives from General Dynamics they\nKept assuring that they had close contact that they actually went and inspected what was going on in Saudi Arabia and they were sure that there wasn't anything on toward a but clearly a that\nI guess more hopeful than a than a than truth so\nWell can I just that's just so is it not somewhat naive to believe that when you're shipping these armored vehicles to whatever country that they will always be used for peace making purposes\nI think it depends on who your customer is and in this case it's a very unreliable customer if we were to find a customers among our NATO allies those who\nAbsolutely do not commit to a human rights offenses\nThen uh we could feel a lot better in terms of of how those vehicles were being used and I want to come back\nTo what I said initially these are probably the best vehicles in the world in terms of peacekeeping and keeping peace keepers safe and that was I think always the intent in terms of ah of the workers and uh\nThank you that we could be proud of thank you very much for speaking with me ms Matheson oh my pleasure take good care and thank you for the opportunity thinking okay Bye bye\nI re map as soon as the MVP member of parliament parliament rather for London fan Shaw we reached her in Ottawa\n\n\nOriole\n\nPolice have so far this week uh intercepted at least ten pipe bombs in the United states addressed to some outspoken critics of president Donald Trump\nAnd investigators are still trying to find out who is behind them but President Trump was already playing his own blame game today against the media\nOne of his tweet said quote a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news unquote [noise]\nOne of the pipe bombs was of course address to CNN and this morning CNN reporter Abby Philip asked to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders\nWhy the president has described the Democrats as quote evil in the past and whether those comments have so division here's that exchange\nIt appropriately so hard that really caught on your network a number of times not only did the ... the president that many people that we're getting into ministry patient\nAbsolutely day in day out there is a negative tonight for the media attention around this president is negative\nDespite historic a job creation despite the fact that our economy is booming despite the fact that trade deals that everybody that couldn't be made have been made despite the fact that the president is trying to solve law and order at our border and protect the security of the Americans are from the east coast to the west coast of north and south you continue to\nFocus only on the negative and there is a role to play yesterday the very first thing that the president did come out and condemned the violence that very first thing your network did would come out and accused the president of being responsible for that is not okay the first things that have been condemned the violence\nThat was White House press secretary Sarah Sanders answering questions from the media this morning [noise] [noise]\nAnd\nYesterday afternoon Curtis about he took his first breath of fresh air in over fourteen hours the self described whimsical scientist has spent those fourteen hours sealed in a homemade airtight que ... bio don't on Vancouver Island\nWell we got we reached Mr ... in Corning British Colombia\nMr Balanchine why is that like to take that first breath of fresh air after fourteen hours enclosed in a plastic wrapped cube\nTrying to say it was pretty fantastic up until then I felt really sick and breathing in our regular fresher atmosphere was it was great [laughter]\nSo tell us why didn't you shot yourself up an airtight container\nSo I Do science experiments on my YouTube channel\nJust in order to raise awareness about basic science concepts and I think that people really don't understand the climate change because they don't even understand what the air is made out of\nAnd you know it's not their fault but I'm trying to do projects like this one so this one I see myself in a box to raise awareness about the base science concepts surrounding climate change\nOkay so let's talk about the actual bio down that you constructed how big is that\nIt's ten feet by ten feet by ten feet so it holds thirty thousand leaders of air which sounds like a lot but really isn't\nAnd and what did you have in there with you\nYeah so I had about two hundred plants which were the most important part and I had a lot of air monitoring and health monitoring equipment and I had a hammock to sleep in a bunch of food about eighty leaders of water and the bucket\nI Would think that would be necessary [laughter] what kind of plants did you have in there with you\nI had a pretty big variety of plants I had some sunflowers and some corn and beans and I had several white cedar trees in there with me [laughter] diversity is important in an ecosystem\nWhere are you eating any of the plants\n[laughter] no I was eating all dried food because I couldn't cook in their ah because cooking emits fossil fuels which are would be toxic to me in their\nKnow you had an experience of your own where your voter registration was put in jeopardy can you tell me what happened to you\n[noise] yes uh in July of twenty seven chain I received a mail or it looks like something where you were request they pin from your bank\nBut the thing that caught my eye was that it had a official United States postal service change of address stick them on it so when I opened the notice it said that we have indication that you have ...\nAnd you need to fill this document out if you do not filled the form out within thirty days we will then move you to him in an active roles now that sentence\nClicked on a whole lot of Bell's in my head because you cannot place anyone on the inactive roles unless they have not voted and at least two federal cycles\nWe had just voted so there was no way they could put us on the inactive list we were being sent that now this illegally we mold within the same county\nAnd saying that challenge that and you challenge and how did you challenge it\nActually because I was so the stress of that I took a picture of it I put it on ... of the ACLU thought\nThey contacted me after that they could represent me in a case and I I agree and I'm so thankful for that and we challenge secretary of state ... who's our chief election officer as well as my county\nACLU decided to settle I wanted to take this to court but I was faced with a dilemma\nOf there were a hundred and fifty nine thousand who are in the same circumstances ally and we were sort of in a limbo in terms of the loop be allowed to vote so in order for myself and the other hundred and fifty nine thousand to be allowed to vote\nI agreed to take the settlement but I Am not happy with the outcome because Brian ... we see no punishment\nRight and Brian Kemp as you say is Georgia's secretary of state and the Republican candidate for governor he strongly denies that he's attempting to suppress the vote in any way what's your response to him\nMy response to him would be let's have a conversation because there are questions about my case that's simply do not sit the rhetoric that he would like us to believe I was not in an active voter but\nI mean to know why was targeted because the only thing I can think of I Am black I Am female and I tend to vote democratic\nWell it's been widely reported that people most affected by this are and like you black or poor people when memories does that evoke for you and for many black people in Georgia\nOh for me that was so personal you know I made civil rights baby um I grew up during the most turbulent times\nOf our history and I have a connection through my own family I mean everyone who was African American in this country we have a connection to the fight so if you don't want me to vote you do not see me and it's not one person one vote is no person no vote\nTo sink the perception that you have in many other people black people uh especially that votes are being surprised that this hurts the legitimacy of elections in the United states\nOh absolutely I'm a big fan of the Democratic process\nShould be however it's throughout the country not just Georgia this has become a partition battle\nAnd just under ... touch any message that we as Americans can say to anybody else we have no right telling any other country you know we're going to bring democracy cheer shorts when we cannot do this year my husband that he said veteran my daughter's a veteran\nI've had people fight for this country\nPut their lives on the line from Senate you turned around\nCome to me and John the I'm not even worth the voting and you're going to try to take something that the ... right no I Will not stand for it\nMeans Hopkins were going
