declared he would vote confirmed judge Kavanaugh has explained his decision to reporters he was drowned out by protesters\nAnd I looked at me like it should be so we'll just see that at a photo investigation by the way it was from I think there was a lot of people that I was concerned about how they show what they did all\nAnd on Monday he was arrested five and Malaysian police and initially they said they were going to charge him with criminal charges for being in a restricted area the airport without a valid boarding pass\nAnd pursue those criminal charges but do they have suggested that they want to deport Hassan to Syria\nIf they did proceed with the charges that he would stay and remind wouldn't be so they would uh they they wanted him out\nYeah if if they had pursued the criminal charges strangely it would have been better for 'em because um he we would have had time to try and figure out how to protect him\nWhat happened to him if he was deported this year he would what does he believe would occur\nWhile he would definitely be imprisoned because he is wanted because he does not complete his mandatory military service he has very clearly no state has his objections to the civil war that's happening in Syria\nAnd he has been quite critical of the Assad regime which means that he would get may be imprisoned probable that he would be tortured it could be even worse\nYou and others have been trying to stop to this deportation and in fact tried to bring him to Canada for all of these months and he has been in the airport so what happened to your efforts\nWell we map all ... and a call to sponsor has sunk to come to Canada we raised over twenty thousand dollars to support that sponsorship application we worked to find a fulltime job so he has a job offer which includes housing in this lucrative Columbia\nHe has for a close family members here in Canada so we had a sickening meeting gotten meant to expedite the costs of the time for that application and to date today have been not able or willing to do that\nIn his status of his file at this point is on has been accepted to Canada is that right\nHints application has been approved what all that means is that when we submitted it it was reviewed by immigration a refugee inches and shipped Canada and approved yet so popular thing at that point it was sent overseas to the high commission of\nUh Canada in Singapore for processing the standard like the type of parts of the there is twenty three to twenty six months\nHe has said that he is willing to sit in the airport for twenty three months of that's what it takes right\nYeah that's what he said we are grateful that say have permitted him to be there for the last seven months and he was only able to survive to the generosity of airline employees who provided him with airline meals it came to the point where Malaysia felt that he could no longer be in the airport\nYou know when we spoke with him back in April he talked about you and your efforts to help him and I just wanted to play a bit of the clip where he talks about what you've done for him\nThey made me believe again and then they ought to just a group of volunteers amazing people no matter what the consequences will be quiet juice or support these people are in there I'm grateful for the ... as long as I was doing last\nThat was owned a concert talking about what you and the other Canadians have done for him\n[noise] yeah it is heartbreaking I you know I I have never met her son but I feel that I Know him I mean we've we've gone through a

I'm doing but I just I'm very scared right now but I'm also hopeful I Believe in our government I I'm just praying and hoping that they will do that\nAnd one of the things that um the Malaysian immigration\n... is that he's shamed Malaysia because of how much publicity he got that he was making these little videos and if people were I was following him on Twitter about what it's like\nTo live in the airport acts of kindness acts of cruelty that he was subjected to what would it actually take at this point to get him to safety\nOne signature minister integration she jets needs a what's

and\nQuite geographically far from the focal piece of land the center of the map and so they put this little island in a box and shifted closer to the focal point it's completely inaccurate geographically speaking but it's convenient and it makes everything just nice and come back from a design perspective\nYou've also probably spend a little to no time questioning the existence of those boxes\nUnless you're a ... for ... you were from shuttle and for some residents Scottish archipelago those boxes have been a point of frustration\nBut this week a new rule came into place a freezer home from a two dimensional confinement by\nBanning government bodies in Scotland from putting Shetland in a box on maps the rule was proposed by Shetland politician ...

over the years I was usually out the items please hold them up in a box incorrect geographical position on many island does if not all of the item does feel pretty upset by that were fed up with\nSo some parliamentary legislation was available earlier this year and I was able to move um some changes to that legislation source to make sure that their future\nChaperones as you say has nothing to box but then it's correct position\nNow is it just because they didn't that people don't like it could hog refers or against Atlanta is there a reason for putting in a box\nI guess the reason is there were two hundred miles across a north of the whole Scottish mainland and therefore a correct pasta\nHas to have a favorite to see the north sea and the way um I don't have a problem with that because we live on islands we depend on ... we have a huge fishing industry that ah\nThat depends on how to proceed marine environment that we have the oil industry all around us as well and do all the industrial mechanisms that depend on the or use the sea so it seems to be a bit strange to have to see is part of the ... the reality of where we all\nGo first to pose to this day and said that\nIs not had Shetland which should be there'll be no new details they actually use these boxes to avoid math sitter mostly water and you lose so much when you have to I have to expand the map that large you know to have Shetland in there\nWell hey hold my ... leaves fall them I mean the way we live I think it's time that we were put in the right place about ... and does believe that it's not just

that voice\nYou know when he had been working on it since the\nI guess there was International Women's day in twenty sixteen with my first question to Justin Trudeau on that day in question period asking him to create a special program to bring you the girls and women to safety in Canada and but it became apparent particularly when ... came to Canada She heard what we were doing and she came to Canada\nAnd then it was undeniable no one could look at her and said no we don't want\nTo help the government created a program and she said she never imagined that this would have happened but she's become really a heroine to her own people into people all over the world\nI wanted to ask you about that voice that person coming into parliament and the effect it had she was what she was in the gallery when there's a ... was debated ...\nShe was sitting with my husband holding in that and we think it's so hard he said you'll never forget when she was\nAnd not the only time she cried I spent time with her listening\nAnd I remember the I wanted to break down so many times and I thought how could I could I cried when she doesn't and I just held at all in and as soon as she left the house I just broke down but\nShe was so strong I just couldn't imagine where does she find that strength I kept thinking to myself and then when he was very emotional when you\nWhen parliament voted in her

find a normal life\nOne of the significant things among all the other things you've just itemized said she did for the needy and women and girls for people is\nThe awareness she brought to the world about rape and sexual assault as a crime of war as a weapon of war they were finally prosecutions about this and the war crimes tribunals lose our board champion does\nThe recognition to these aren't just things that happened that some individual goes too far these are organized campaigns to destroy communities and cultures through destroying their young women so do you think that that is ultimately what she's about to the world\nShe has no doubt about that and exactly what you say that rape is just a symptom of a war it's just a side effects and it just war is dirty and nasty and complicated and these things just happen well no they don't just happen because the truth as\nRape is used as a tool to war particularly when we think of ethnic cleansing but what happened to be as eating women was exactly that when we talk about women peace and security\nIt shouldn't be talked about you know over here in the sand box you know this is just a gender issue that we add to the to the subtext of a particular discussion around the peace process no it should be at the center of the discussions because it's at the center of what is uh\nI think what she's done this remarkable I look at her and I think my goodness for her agent for what she went through to be able to rise up and eat that folks person it's just it's remarkable\nI don't know if you've had a chance to speak with ... have you talked to her he reached out to her\nI did I think right now right away in London Simon I thought it'd be the headline a little earlier than Canadians dead and I just want\nTo think that
