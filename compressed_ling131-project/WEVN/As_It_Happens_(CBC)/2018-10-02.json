has described the U.S MCA the trade deal to replace NAFTA the U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nComes after months of tough negotiating rumors of concessions and a lot of back and forth trips from Washington DC to auto walk\nHere is what prime minister Justin Trudeau said today I think\nWe have all been through moments are over\nWhere we felt very close only to see it or not end up working out so I think we were all very mindful that there was a definite window that now with\nA where the uh the midnight deadline by the United states to send a text to Congress a was a very real deadline that give us an opportunity to work towards that\nBut I have to say from my own perspective it was there wasn't a single a ha moment there was just a series of okay we got this one settled wow we ... we saw this one and it's not done yet but there is this sense that when things were falling into place\nI think one of the moments for me was when we realized that we had a an entire chapter Nineteen uh that was where I started to realize okay you know what I think I think we're going to be able to get to a to a place 'cause we've kept in place are the rules are that protects you trade and enforced trade agreements like this\nFor his part US President Donald Trump also declared victory today at a press conference in Washington DC a reporter asked him about tensions between him and prime minister Trudeau here's how we responded\nHe's a professional I'm a professional we had very strong tensions that\nIt was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's a much different deal to brand new deal not NAFTA redone it's brand new deal I just spoke with him we have a great relationship but we're going to work as a partner\nBut it seemed that we've been warned that this was coming that something had to give and it was going to be likely that the the dairy industry and finding a little more or less\nGoing to be the trade off to get the other concessions kind seeking did did you see this coming\nWhile I'm certainly there's been a precedent set in all trade deals up to date\nThat I Want to get that it gets down to the wire hum they seem to give up a a a percent of the the dairy market to people like to talk about the powerful dairy lobby in Canada were over three so far so I don't know about powerful\nCanadian point of view here's what it looks like we were looking at a um a really big dent being put into our manufacturing industry in her ... in Idaho ah in in a auto bills in auto parts\nAnd what we've changed and also ... disputes mechanism this chapter Nineteen that was very important to Canada and in exchange they seem to have given up three point six percent to the Canadian dairy market to us farmers\nThat doesn't seem like a I guess it's an awful trade to a lot of Canadians I don't think\nWell I I find it interesting you say that because I'm ... the NAFTA deal is already in place chapter Nineteen was already in place so\nIf chapter Nineteen or this or NAFTA panel was such an efficient with such a great thing to have a why wasn't doing anything about the aluminum and steel tariffs why wasn't going to be able to protect us from terrorists in our automobile\nUh if if there's not a panel was half it works in a forgiving up the dairy industry or we shouldn't have been concerned about those terrorists in the first place\nWhat would you have done would you have walked away would you said no deal\nOr it's very complicated obviously a they were getting ready to a hit us with more tariffs so that that was not a good situation for candidates to be falling in but um I I didn't find this was like any other trade negotiation at least\nWith ah the Europeans and the Trans Pacific deal ah everyone was there I think the groceries eating fairly\nThis one was more like extortion this one was they hijacked sectors of our economy they threatened to do irreparable damage to our economy\nAnd if we didn't give them what they wanted or they would proceed with these tariffs um I I found it was very aggressive it wasn't that go shooting a this wasn't a negotiation this was a negotiating our way out of a hostage situation\nSo again would you walked away then would you have said no deal I'm not going to be held hostage\nSome somebody has to do this or the way Trump is proceeding in and and uh the way he's he's ruined I I find so many uh of parts of society or I thought Canada was going to the country\nTo to stand up to them and said you know this isn't right we have rules in place NAFTA already had certain rules that you shouldn't have been able to to put tariffs on aluminum and steel and they told me to address those issues we shouldn't have been going any further\nBut we heard today from prime minister to do and some foreign affairs minister freelance\nWas that they basically said that well that the upside for the dairy farms and dairy farmers is that the supply management system is fundamentals in it at least is still in place\nAnd that the dairy farmers are going to be compensated for losses they suffer as part of this trade deals so against Mitt Canadian point of view it's hard to see how we've lost that what would you say back if you could be at that press conference and respond what would you say\nHow did we get to that point that we were no longer looking for a better deal we're just looking to salvage something out of it so that we didn't get completely stories I don't understand why are we allowed ourselves to be on her knees as bad as we want we were in a bad\nNegotiated to salvage something but we weren't smart enough to get ourselves and not that it was theirs for the last year\nAnd now if it does go to as we see it how does that change your life how does that change your work your business\nOr you mentioned to the compensation package of they've had numerous compensation packages or put it for for other trade deals that I received your dollars to date usually instead of giving a money over to a farmer's to figure out the best way to distribute it\nThey come up with some was our way of uh investing it in our farms and uh if you don't fit the exact the type that they want for the investments and you're not eligible on the money is always a little suspicious so to date I receive dollars\nBut are you going to survive are you going is your business going to to be okay\nIt's doesn't help I mean of course you know you know carry on I'm a I'm Still relatively young I have a son was wanting to come home and farm\nSo we'll have to make an investment and are trying to\nBe more efficient to fight back the market share that we've lost all our money uh reinvest that money and things and try and get my cash flow back up to where it was part of why survival of the radio what you're going a trading off three plus percent\nUh every year we only know how ... of our market share of knowledge can't continue to go on forever doing that and the problem is is next time you go to negotiate no one's ever happy with what they have they'll want more so if we're already over ten percent of given up of our market\nThe Americans only allowed two percent of the trade war over ten percent now so who's who's the protection of food who's not a free trader and not enough says\nOkay not so good points and Mr is going to appreciate speaking with you thank you well thank you for calling\nJason ... is a dairy farmer we reached mentioned Brooke Quebec and we will have more on the U.S ... later on in the program including various tongue twisting attempts to pronounce the name of the new agreement and an interview with former conservative cabinet minister bitter McCain\n[noise]\n\nFirst there was an earthquake and then came the water a deadly six meter soon on me\n[noise]\n\nThat is a clip from a video that has been circulating on social media a man on a balcony warning people below the water is coming\nToday survivor's on the Indonesian island of ... are dealing with the destruction of friday's left behind as we go to air the official death toll is over eight hundred that number is likely to rise to over one thousand officials have been burying the dead in mass graves\nRebecca ... is the BBC's Indonesia editor we reached her in Palo which was hit by the tsunami\nRebecca can you describe but you're able to see in town right now\nAt the moment I'm standing on one of the main route tied in to the worst affected area\nAnd you might hear in the background the sound that have the trucks coming in they having excavated into the elite the has been much needed in every single day that he ...\nThe ... with ... ... ... ... the the looting Clinton meant\nSo to find voted to in the rubble of houses that were destroyed by that powerful quake on friday and then also washed away by the tsunami that was triggered by it\nDo they still believe that they can recover people alive or is this a recovery operation at this point\nThere has been some rescue attempt in the last forty eight hours that have been successful in one place he killed in a ...\n... for a hotel\nThat collapsed the hotel owner was saying yes today that he was still hearing people yelling out for help and Denise rubble but he wasn't able to reach them they did manage to rescue more than twenty four people though using their hands from that hotel\nBut as the days continue the hope of finding people alive\nI Would have to say now flame\nYou haven't been able to get to the hospitals to see what is happening there who's being cared for and how they're being cared for wouldn't tell us to tell us what's going on there\nWho have been to some of the small medical clinics\nAround ... situation a very bleak and there's no power to the entire town so\nHospitals any coup clinic set time too complicated operations are they running out of medical supplies and in most of them the ones that we've been to those roads the forties and plastic bags\nIn one that we went to there was a young girl a five year old girls that they had found a loan and she had a broken leg and was crying out in pain on a stretch and not far from the body bags\nAnd show the circle widen the more you talk to people the more leads you get that so you talk to additional people and that process continues really until you run out of people to talk to\nBut what could they get out of its say talking to mark judge who was the the friend Kevin ... who was allegedly in the room when this is like assault took place they he has already put out a statement saying that he doesn't\nRemember this a ... but it's totally against the character he knows that cabinet to have\nA he doesn't think it happened what more could do ... what could the FBI find out from my guide that didn't come out in that statement\nWon't Mark Church is a good example Carol statement that he put out was put out through his lawyer it wasn't sort of has to he wasn't pushed on it he wasn't prodded to remember other details wasn't asked perhaps for the names of people who might have been there if he continues to claim that he mark judge was not\nAnd so that's why I'm agents wants to talk directly to witnesses\nI'm not saying that all that but we're put together a false statement or a misleading statement but might have been a cursory statement and it needs to be tested\nAnd some of the things that had been set including by your former boss James Comey is that the the leads that were presented on Thursday to an investigation would be evidence that a judge Kavanaugh\nMay have lied during his testimony that he may have not been\nFully open about his drinking habits and about his problems in that area of alcohol what investigators want to know about that would that be something that you need to know more about as to what we're judge Kavanaugh's drinking habits while he was in in high school and in university\nNot necessarily accept that it's important that anybody up for confirmation for Supreme Court seat before the Senate Judiciary committee be completely truthful\nSo oddly the underlying conduct whether he drank or drink to excess in high school might not be all that relevant but whether he was honest with the Senate Judiciary committee about his drinking habits I think is relevant\nAnd then there are also the references to the year book that was presented that remarks that were sent about ... Kevin ... at the time and that he said we're references to drinking when in fact I said no they were\nReferences to sexual activity and some of it quite quite awful about what they might have done or why did you do to some women so whether he did or didn't do any of those things that what matters in that that he may have misrepresented what that book was saying\nWell to be clear some of the underlying conduct if he assaulted women is absolutely disqualify\nA no ifs ands or buts about that on the other hand if it had to do only with drinking I use that term only cautiously it's still very important that he'd be honest about it before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIf however the underlying conduct is um the way he treated women whether he sexually assaulted or abused them\nIn some way that matters a lot and that's why you want a full FBI investigation to the extent we can find out we need to find out\nAll right we'll be launching Mr Rosenberg I appreciate speaking with you thank you\nCarol thank you for having me on the show and thank you for giving me a chance to talk about the FBI\nChuck Rosenberg is a former senior CIA official where we met his office in Washington DC\n\nGimme gimme\nSay hey what you got ...\nIs a God Knows ...\nYou got us MCA [noise] how'd you heard by now that is the new name for the renegotiated version of NAFTA and that abbreviations awkwardness has many people annoyed for in the case of Financial Times writer Alan Beatty\nNearly serious media exploded on Twitter trying to stop people from referring to the U.S MCA as an acronym because he says it cannot be pronounced as a word\nWe reached Allen bt in Brussels\nAllen us NCAA doesn't really rolled off the tongue doesn't\n\nIt doesn't seem to receive care of our language as well as trade deals are kind of disappointing 'cause there was such a thing could say the single word you know you could have dumped into slogans like NAFTA we don't have to that kind of thing and not just been replaced by yet another abbreviation that you call and you say well\nOkay but you've taken one step further you don't you're not just kind of disappointed you're mad because why because people are using it\nI'm ... how people using it I'm also not because people say I couldn't name when they mean abbreviations and you know an accident was a thing you can say NAFTA is not good in us MCI isn't it ... and I just I don't think we should be but ... was the name of acronyms cause they happen to visit them but\nThis is that you say this is a hill that you're willing to die on\nAbsolutely yes ups and why [laughter] well\nI tell you why I've covered shades and will be ten years okay when I started a as a journalist when I started covering shade or they like this is the subject so complicated that the abbreviation started running into full that says the fall that basically all the stuff I've covered it into three lectures marriage going in for that [noise] and so keeping in your head\nAll these enormous it'd be patients when you came across one that you could she said that was actually a ... and then you really want to sort of hold on to it I'm a third of the fact that this has gone on dissipated and there'll be ... seems to be\nOut of angry about it that I just find it very surprising\nNow of course people are arguing that in fact you you can turn it into an acronym you could say was ... or ... or something of that nature right I mean it's not all is not lost on\nThe realities of our soldiers that's supporting them through the ... the ... um\n... this is really vowels and this is like well I guess since it was not going to look at you came\nTo that in the inconvenient any place to either end you see what you really needed some kind of out in the middle east you all people invented the ... the or in a in the middle so suddenly as you just said it was ... as a loose some car or something like this one other thing which is unbelievably deceitful\nAnd these people just switched to conference around um and so people to kind of got what we can say it was more\nLike you you could say however that just endless tributes wrong because it's the constant during the wrong over\nOkay here's some way to get the next a next is a vowing here since there's us there's two letters Canada see a two letters and actually the only has one leg is if you put an actually put the ... in ... in his knee you'd have ... ... I mean that one\nEveryone gets their fair share do six letters and everyone has hazard to letters\nThat will be great if that lady named it I Would invite you to address your complaints to the white\nHouse or see but you know they didn't do that and why they called why they didn't do that you can understand that\nYou could also switches around right some suggesting that we could call it the ah the Canada Mexico us agreement and say see a and you asked me to be can be if you did in French\nThey view that I think it would be perfect that would add up the absolutely perfect and it was more or less you know the touch the existential despair and the nothing that trace of existential just won't try to shift the numbers Donald Trump\nYou have ... you can actually put ... into this existential angst and can be both the same thing right\nThat that's I mean I remember the and I think he's done a great novels with my mother died today was it yesterday I caught Melinda she just she competed in cash\n'em and you could say that you could just say exactly the same ... the author yesterday I Can't remember um\nThat would be that would be the other countries that had been ... they come up with I Would have ... it it just sort of ... of ... e copy after effects are common sense\nBut what's what's missing obviously besides the ex about is the words free trade and trade isn't even in the world trade isn't in here free trade and open trade managed a no reference to trade\nAnd so that it doesn't it's we don't even know what kind of agreement this is this non acronym pile of laughter doesn't tell us anything does it\nTake issues plagues is not really what time of that but I'm the idea of shades and treat shade and so there's not so discredited you have to prevent this about trade and you can't even say what's it about um an shows you know you have an agreement you can't even say politically and it doesn't say go to the doctor just looking at the level\nAnd just for we're noticing today as we were looking into ... we were writing and reading on the board NAFTA we just keep using NAFTA all our all of our interview questions all of our internal documents were just calling it NAFTA do you think that people will secretly keep calling it NAFTA despite this new name", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Keene", "day": "02"}
