... had allowed to go to get in the way and quote blown this big time we reached berries that common in Windsor\n... then you told the committee that Canada's foreign affairs minister was quote way out of her the league in negotiating with Robert Lighthizer the American negotiator what did you mean by that\nWell first as a Carroll let me make something a perfectly clear because there there's a misconception\nI'm a Canadian I was born and raised in Canada and I still live in Canada and I started my business here so I'm not a a an American CEO coming over to Canada and ah and trying to uh uh uh you know force my voice over here\nBut now I mean it says is that is do the issue at hand which is ... that's what you are referring to write\nIt while I'm ... I'm referring to to to that in ... surrounding that in the negotiations surrounding the new uh a U.S MCA deal I I Believe that this deal I Know for a fact\nThis deal could have been done a long time ago I Know it could have been done with Canada having a bigger and better voice at the table I was concerned from the beginning that Mexico will go behind Canada's back and negotiate a deal and of course they did do that\nAnd then candidate was forced to the eleventh hour to move in and agree to terms that quite frankly that Mexico negotiated\nI wasn't surprised I mean I I'd heard similar charges begin to circulate secondhand people telling me they'd heard them already who owned the grapevine a and I saw it and good grief I mean why are people bringing this up now because I had a lot of\nWe disagreed about but it seems to me his opinions are utterly beside the point and irrelevant to the fact that he was a journalist who was murdered\n... what are some of the things that you have heard that you know that that you find quite alarming that us media commentators have been saying this week\nWell one of the things that's come up with the idea that he was an extremist or an Islamist and at some point people even say so sympathetic towards ...\nAnd uh I think that was really a terrible exaggeration he had some sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood there's no question about that that was something I disagreed with him about a quite a lot but the idea that he was an extremist or that he was a a not a journalist but an activist\nOr even more than an activist a conspiratorial person a conspirator\nIt was all I think a disturbing because I think a lot of it is quite inaccurate and very exaggerated\nI decided that just basically to the Muslim Brotherhood charge because there there there's different there's varying degrees of radicalism within that organizes eight and ... where was he on the spectrum he was some\nVersion of a fellow traveler in other words he switched simply he saw them as\nA legitimate part of the Arab political scene and I think he was sympathetic to Muslim Brotherhood parties in the sense that I Would think he was basically one of these people and and there are lots of them who is basically a liberal but who sees the Brotherhood\nAs a core part of our democracy it it's not my point of view but it's not an ... an illegitimate eccentric or extreme point of view it's a legitimate perspective\nAnd one of those things that started to float around and was retweeted by none other than Donald Trump junior was photo a mystical ... D with Osama bin Laden that rattling around Afghanistan and just somehow in El ... synthesized said what what's the story behind that\nWell that is that is a really great example of how disgusting but says become because\nAt no point in his life was ... and all kinds of sympathizer or a believer in violence or terrorism he did begin his career as many journalists young journalists um both Arabs and and Americans at at the time did covering the war in Afghanistan\nAnd as a as a young Saudi journalist he was able to get in with this new breed of people who at the time we called Arab Afghans or you know sort of our part of the job he did a and then eventually some of them more tuned to becoming al ... the fact that he was covering them partly makes\nHim a sympathizer and the great irony of course is that these people got going and they were in Afghanistan and doing what they were doing because the United states was encouraging them to do it any arms that they had came from the United states and but it was always essentially involved in an American covert war\nSo what's behind this he can he raise the question why several times why is because there are people who know that the background to this short distance to discredit set so why why they doing it\nI think that the whole point here and it's really disgusting is to try to mitigate the sense of outrage about what's happened to an end to kind of say in a very round about way\nThat this isn't all that bad because he was either not a journalist but an activist or even a spirit or and he was not a liberal he was in Islam is or even an extremist and the terrorist or something you know ... those are the kind of progression\nOf absurdity that you get and anywhere you go in this direction I think he's intended to make people feel less alarmed less horrified less angry and to recast says as less of an outrage you know this is not the time and moment\n... complex political opinions on that would've been before he was killed or a long time after the cases resolved right now the only thing that can be gained by this frankly is to try to imply that it's not that big a deal and I find that horrible\nI Wonder who who the target is because the same time we have seen a Donald Trump said that journalists at the enemy the people he praised politician for having assaulted a journalist so obviously there's no love lost their so who who's the intended target for this\nI think the intended audience is people on the right of the American spectrum or others who are trying to think very badly about the Muslim Brotherhood maybe supporters of Israel people on the Christian right intense secularists which you put me in that last count but still\nThe point is that I think that there's an idea that ... being misrepresented being cast as a better person than he was which is ridiculous but I think that's the idea and that people who can really learn what he actually thought\nWe'll think again about how bad this was that if\nIt really infuriating and they're not all lives like any good conspiratorial urban legend there's a grain of truth in parts of it but uh I think the only thing that can be gained right now by getting into it is to make people care less about the fact\nThat he's gone missing and probably dead\nDoes this indicate though that how much they are worried about this story and about the the impact there's a lot of people worried about how big an impact is the art and science\nI Would imagine that they don't want the United states to overreact and certainly there are pro Israel voices who do not want the United states to become too strange from Saudi Arabia I Want to keep the heat on Iran\nAnd want to make sure that this doesn't mess that up and I actually think that's a very important project but I I think that these are two different matters you know nothing should justify people's sense of outrage about this a heinous atrocity\nWe leave it there will be following
