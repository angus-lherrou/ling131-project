like him to say that the Saudis\nWell first I Hope that he is tough on Saudi Arabia that he offers any kind of United States helped to turkey the investigation that ultimately I think perhaps the United States Congress and the administration should consider a treating this\nSo is this launches this shift is this\nAction as it is a rescue mission\n[noise] I think it first and foremost humanitarian effort but I think it also has a pedagogical value as much as as political I mean I think it's important for people to recognize what the governments are doing regarding migrant rescue what governments like Italy is are blocking\nI think it all kinds of pedagogical value in another sense you know I'm In the U.S and here there's a great feeling of you know not only disillusionment but powerlessness you're faced with now we right wing governments [noise]\nRacist policies but also a feeling of even though it's probably not completely true right wing majority favoring them I think

the plants what to do so I don't think they seeking confrontation with the government told police it's really it doesn't seem to me like a useful tactic but\nOnce you shrink from it either I think that we still have to stand up for what we fix right\nAway but there are people who the on that but what about those migrants to possibly by hundreds will be on a ... ... ... are they are they do become palms in it and then literally not\nNecessarily not and that's why I said before that I think the the obvious and first purpose was such a mission is humanitarian aid if their profits and

the hardest test you've never heard of ... worked for years before they take it they often fail on their first try and on the second and third now twenty three wine experts who passed the masters similarly exam this fall have lost their designation\nThe exam is given by the court of master ... the group of strips the titles because it discovered someone leaked information about the ones on the tasting exam the court has that little else about the cheating scandal [noise]\nCourtney she was always a wine journalist who worked as a ... and some of New York's top restaurants we reached her in New York\nCutting you first of all what does it mean to ... to get this title as mass testimony\nIt's probably the most lauded as she could have in the ...\nSupport for an age yours lunchroom comes from you our listeners and from community minded buttons then we'd dealerships during keen swans and all of us are Conan giving back to the community for over Thirty years ... dealerships dot com\nOr wanted ... just still in a lot of shock um and they're really surprised because something like this has never happened before and especially considering that twenty three of the twenty four master some way to pass this year had work to pass this tasting portion it's usually the most difficult\nPiece of the master ... to pass\nSo it's really just been devastating not only for them but for the entire white beauty\nAnd the exam is notoriously rude result three parts of it which is I guess or is a knowledge based part there is a practical part and then there is is most difficult part which is that\nThe tasting portion of the exam just described for people what it entails\n[noise] yeah absolutely is the masters only exam itself is the highest of four levels that you can achieve within the quarter master ... so you have to pass your introductory certified and advanced exam which can take several years to pass\nSo by the time that you get to her master's only exam first you have to pass theory on a separate gay and then on a later date you have both a practical exam a service exam which also\nIncludes questions that you may be given on the floor as ... as well as the tasting exam which is six lines that you must blind taste in twenty five\nTwenty five minutes six wines you're blindfolded or you're you're you're you can't see what you're doing and you have to identify what\n[noise] so you're not blindfolded you can see the winds in front of you it's usually three white and three\nRed but you must go through each of the wind systematically assess the site the aromas and the power of the line and then based on what you're tasting you must come to a conclusion on where the wind is from what the great variety is\nAn ... vintage the wine is from as well\nWhen you consider the they say that most people blindfold who can't tell the difference between white wine in red wine is really extraordinary what they have to know\nYeah absolutely\nAnd so this part of the exam misses the part that has been called into question what exactly happened\nSo we really don't know the court of master suddenly it's America's has not released too much information on what\nSpecifically happen all we've been told is that a current master ... released information that was pertinent to the tasting flights of the exam so we don't know if that was\nBefore during or after the exam because the candidates are never told what the winds are even after the exam we don't know if they reveal the identity that the wind if they just gave them some clues as to what might be on the exam we really don't know and they have\nNot release any additional information about that\nWould have cancelled the exam results of the taste portion or the whole exam\nJust the tasting portion and they have a invalidate the results for everybody so that means is that everyone who took the tasting portion of the exam whether they passed or failed now have the opportunity to reset the exam\nWhat did the people who did the exam what did they go through to get to the point where they were doing this test\nI mean it is a huge time and financial investment to study for the masters on my exam but particularly the tasting portion of the exam because you have to taste a lot of wind in order to be able to pass\nI Know that in the film the sound failed that came out a few years ago some estimated that they spent as much as twenty thousand dollars on wind to taste throughout the year before their exam\nAnd the person who is suspected of having given this confidential information to those taking the tests and ... whatever he or she went through to get there is this is a huge risk lead to lose a lot that's been last year I Would imagine\nAbsolutely one I've spoken to other master some ways for the piece that I wrote in seven fifty daily they really\nWeren't boggled at why somebody would want to cheat the system because it is such a high honor why would they then want to undercut the name by giving someone out information that allowed them to cheat the exam\nYou know when we're trying to get someone to talk to us about this uh people refused to do an interview ... a Sunday doesn't want to talk with you agreed does that surprise you that so many people don't want to even discuss this\n[noise] it doesn't surprise me that those who had gained the title of master ... and now we're having\nTaken away from them it doesn't surprise me that they don't want to talk at this point because I think for many the emotions are still raw and they also so badly want to keep this title that they want to think before they say anything publicly\nBecause one day they may be members again\nIn this organization for me I feel confident speaking about it both as a former ... and also because I had spoken to others and I would like to give voice to them if they cannot do so themselves\nAnd one of them that you're giving voice to you who you quoted in the article one of the ... who lost their certificate or this person said to you I Know this is not the intent but I feel like a marker I'm embarrassed though I did nothing wrong\nThey're saying that while you can take the federal government to court after it's passed a law and say that that's unconstitutional violation of treaty rights\nBut the courts can't into the er during the legislative process is that what they're saying\nIs that what they're saying but I I totally disagree with that I totally disagree because one is the last time any legislation has been overturned impact inherent rights of our people\nNever and you know it's a lot of lip service that they do a very good at it when the liberal government came into power prime minister Justin Trudeau\nSaid the most important relationship that he wants to have is with the first nations well that's nothing but ... says the that the liberal government has a give us a nothing but lip service to\nThe elections coming soon they're going to come back and are trying to get support from the first nations chances are first nations are are going to get stronger and get together and and not support a liberal\nGovernment and the the relationship right now is a it's a it's damage or is it through parable well describe your work and to be done on on on a part of a the federal government or a version power\nWhat is it you want them to do in in this in not just in this case that they say in the development of was below the poverty level in the ... what are you trying to stop them from developing and or or what what level do you want to see an end in an intervention\nWe want to be part of a of this uh the development we want to be part of it's manageable\nBut they don't have the green light to start to destroy our line than and destroy the fish habitats and hold our waterways uh no we we we want to have a say in what goes on and\nThrough our rights that are supposed to be protected by the federal government to make sure that we have something to go forward with for for many years to come and who we've never been heard we've uh you know the two thousand and five case with a minister uh\nShe coughs or department trying to take up lands we reach out and then we won that in the Supreme Court so you think that this one should have been easier to make for for ... court\nSo uh I feel that the Supreme Court judges or didn't want to make that decision based on whether they get a backlash from a from the rest of Canada and the federal government doesn't matter which what's a party in power\nThey've always kept the the general public in a dark they don't know that they're part of the treaty and that uh they're benefiting more from the treaty didn't know the frustrations are\nAsked at the beginning when he goes from here so you got the Supreme Court ruling on this at national chief tied down by ... is saying that where it takes you is into the carts over and over again that this is just going to be lots of court cases lot ... as as lawyers lots of consultations this is this is the future\nLet's just put it this way\nJust wait and see what happens because uh I don't think we we have any faith any court system in in this country anymore and uh\nYou know things are going to change and ... really don't speak for the nation's I'm very saddened at the national chief\nWould be working closely with uh I not to try to push a there are enough to gender to basically erode our treaty rich so uh I I have no ah I have no faith in\nThe sleeping giant two weeks yes she's coterie thank you very much alright thank
