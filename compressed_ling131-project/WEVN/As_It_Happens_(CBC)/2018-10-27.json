I I\nI I just can't imagine that anyone would do this\nWe did receive a suspicious package\nIn our office and my staff\nWho insane to\nBe able to recognize when we get a suspicious package it exactly the right thing followed the procedures\nAnd guy and you know obviously when\nYou you have a suspicious package come to your office and you had staff who has who has handled it on and you realize that\nThere is essential things are it sounds\nIt's it's frightening night nightmares and die\nSo one of the things that I Know I'm going to make sure that I Do\nIs\nGo back and I said on the appropriations subcommittee that guy that that handle the procedures in funding for these things\nI'm Sorry to have to ask you this\nWhat happened to your brother Nick at night in March and how he was killed\nSo the Hoover driver had only been in Toronto I Believe for four days or so so he didn't really know\nAnything really was so he he gets on the highway but he's going he's kind of set of West on like you\nCan even really know attraction to be on so he gets off it's been a huge turned around to start going west on the gardener and ah they're coming up for the turn off to the airport and is a phone a lot of its cradle onto the floor\nAnd he pulled over to the side highway\nBut he didn't fully pull over he was still partially in the library the traffic and he Richard disown and then he reassured the highway without really properly speeding up or checking is near at the same time there was a BMW\nThat was changing lanes from the federal aid to the right lane doc driver admitted that he was a\nA he said he was checking time on his phone I mean who knows if that's true or not but he was looking at his phone\n... and the damned Schreiber rear ended the uber and it was exactly the point where my little brother was was sitting in the class so\nMy little brother side of the car took all of the impact and uh [noise] ... not cause was broken and he was basically\nKilled in semi thankfully his uh his girlfriend Monica I'm was only moderately injured\nSo sorry what what training did the driver had\nNothing in twenty sixteen when city council was meeting to decide um what regulations there should be for a retro drivers what they ended up doing was just getting rid of safety training for not just\nRush hour drivers but taxi drivers as well they lowered the bar for everyone it was just saying the incredibly reckless in stupid decision\nAs a director ... because this tribe or I don't think could have passed a the most basic safety safety test\nHe was just so incompetent and I had no business transferring the public at all so um what we're looking for is just some bare minimum of safety training some safety attracts you to see that someone actually has a competent and safe driver before they're allowed to pick up members of the public\nBecause when you call it over you don't it's a complete stranger who's coming to pick you up you don't know how safe are are confident they are\n... earlier this month Hoover candidates that that they think that technology now that's a good job of drivers skill on the road and then its customers lodge safety concerns about a drive in the company will investigate what do you think about those measures\nThat completely ridiculous that means the passengers are doing the safety testing for river if a drivers on faith and confidence than I guess he or she will create passengers for awhile give them an fifth fries and in the passengers will\nAlert ... poorly I mean I'm sure this a driver would have actually been weeded out that way but in the meantime the public's being put at risk\nEven experience drivers sometimes do really stupid things how can you be that the extra safety training would have prevented the kind of accident that your brother was killed in\nMedia accidents absolutely happen all the time\nIn this case yes because there's been some freak accident if you get them everything that would be understandable but the level of confidence and recklessness is just extreme and we can't we kept preventive react to that from happening but we can take a simple commonsense measures to reduce the likelihood of things like this happen and\nYou and your family even launched a petition to convince me of Toronto that drivers require safety training um how hopeful are you that that will happen\nI Am cautiously optimistic that common sense will prevail the whole um idea\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from radiation energy a local employee owned

he was very hard drive and\nI took him out in the car is good practice and he was so different cautious he was he was driving a truck is near factor like Ella choice to relax\nAnd for someone so conscientious and so a caring of others three killed in this way\nJust makes it all the more frustrating than Todd\nPatrick and again I'm Sorry I'm and thank you so much for speaking with me oh no

[noise]\n\nAdorable softball or nightmare inducing orange menace well Philadelphia's city council has made up its mind ... last night it passed a resolution to welcome and owner of the sauce and controversial new mask on of the Philadelphia fliers here's a clip\nPollution and welcoming the new mascot the Philadelphia fliers and honoring the spirit and passionate greedy is brought to the city of Philadelphia and the entire country both on and off the ice introduced councilwoman game she ever going to ask out forming good\nThank you so much counsel each season ticket holder for the Philadelphia\n\nOver to second that\nMoving probably sick at all in favor say aye those oppose us having that was\n\n\n\nThe ugly [noise]\nGreat he is the Philadelphia players first ever mascot he is not a traditional mascot he's fine but he's also horrifying and because of that he has divided fans and people around the world they were human created and designed greedy he lives in West grove Pennsylvania but today we reached Mr Raymond\nMr Raymond what\nWas it like to hear a city council pay tribute to gritty\nWell I'll tell you it's um the whole thing has been somewhat of a surprise when they reach say a different level of decibel if you will in terms of the acknowledgement any acceptance because going in certainly uh we were preparing for it to not be accepted in any way shape or form\nIn in terms of credits roll out and did not only that it did come in negative very early in the short twenty four hours at a completely reversed and now suddenly a gritty is a phenomenon and it's it's not something that anybody myself for the flyers explains expected\nWhy were you expecting such a negative reaction well have you ever been to Philadelphia [laughter] huge bill I'm not sure who you're insulting [laughter] why on I'm going to take a I'm going to take a pedal back [laughter]\nAre fans are are very very discriminating in terms they had great knowledge about each sport\nUm and they don't like any fooling around you know they want to get to it they want to win so they when you throw some marketing at them they sense that this is some you know sneaking way to get people to love the flyers um they're against it in in in Philadelphia it's been tough things they do not like you know the furry creatures however\nThe fanatic [noise] a kind of slipped under the radar back in Nineteen Seventy eight has become one of the best known mascots in sports\nThis is the Philly fanatic um for for the Phillies baseball team\nCorrect and the and he's probably recognize as one of the best mascots and all sports [noise] um and and I was the performer for this unethical and he was wrote in Nineteen Seventy eight so they were frightened to but back in that day you could ... came out and that they just let the fanatic come out one night didn't say anything about him and\nHe got a lot of positive response but today's world\nIs there anything binding about the document\nWell and the official church teaching and but it it it depends really I think on the local bishops and communities to implement and\nNow ... you mentioned you know being outside and of course you're protests have taken outside of the Vatican and the Senate what kind of reaction did you get there\nThere are just ten percent of the participants are women within the Senate hall so on the day that the Senate began we had a witness outside the Senate gates and to call for women to vote within within the Senate hall basic they called the bishops out I name and say we see what you're doing I\nMean Europe closing the door and making decisions without us so we were able to peacefully protest out at the Senate hall I'm also praying of or twenty five minutes or so before they're going to mend police came and I'm\nAsked us to stop basically I was held for simply by my arm and everyone was forced show identification\n... what about the reaction from the crowds were there any was there any reaction from ... passers by or or ... people observing notably two pilots\nFrom Ireland came and greeted us in and took our materials the fact that women cannot vote in a meeting and tree that's an Eighteen is it's pretty absurd to most people so we got a lot of support from people walking by\nNow Pope Francis has promised to put more women and leadership roles and after five years there are only six women in you know what can be defined as leadership roles at the Vatican what more would you like from him\nWell there are things that he could do immediately and he could appoint went into positions of leadership I'm across the Vatican today that physicians that don't require ordination and\nNow there's been a lot of criticism of Pope Francis a boat how slow he has been to understand the sex abuse issue within the Catholic Church and how he said the right things but has has has been very slow to act\nI'm there hasn't been as much public criticism towards him a boat women do you think he gets the issue of of why women should be included in in the Catholic Church and given leadership positions\nMany of us are calling for equality and are not satisfied by the slow progress of his papacy to bring women into you know substantial leadership position\nMhm but do you think he gets it you know I\nI really hope that he is able to meet with men who are called to be ... as the pastor I Know that he you know would respond to them with a a generous heart and I hope that he has a man of conversion\nYeah no I understand that that's what you hope I guess what I'm trying to ask you is do you think the pope Francis is a Catholic leader who can grasp uh why it's necessary in two thousand and Eighteen to fully include women um\nI guess I'll have to see so far he hasn't made any moves to include women in substantial voting positions or made tremendous steps towards women in the position so I mean five years in a lot of us are are you know\nTired of waiting um but I I I Do think that it ... it takes time for change to happen but you know my I Do think that uh he has a lot to learn can microwave thanks so much for speaking with me think you\nCould medical we is the executive director of the
