forward and too embarrassed to move forward with charges so that's why we had one great victim that we were able to glean a lot of information from\nAnd were able to charge the psychic with extortion fraud over and the witchcraft fortune telling charge\nAnd then now because that's been in the newspapers and we've been able to get it out there a lot more victims have been willing to see and not be
