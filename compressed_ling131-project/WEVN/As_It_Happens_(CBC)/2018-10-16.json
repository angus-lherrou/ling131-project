I Know that that's it well hang on land in Cape Breton that's pretty big because someone that so ... what is that something that people often say\nOh no no like gets editorial caught a fat only used I

matter of time and you are you running of the people you talked order on\nBut the but has the ... ... you'd think that he did acknowledge the apology to dig up to your apology\nOh I've never heard from Lawrence are what an alarm goes on our problems in the front or almost roses altered yeah in a front man for further on those terrible agriculture you are going to be getting off from Logan related\nI bet you did go on and is that it didn't you you didn't stop there you said that ah you said you should tender his resignation and come home to ... and then you said please don't be remembered as the jerk that destroyed the dairy industry\nSo now you're told me he's going to be a jerk if he doesn't resign\nWell all of them I don't want it to be remembered as a joke I didn't actually following a joke\nBut so if he doesn't do what you say you should do which is ... resigned and come home that he is a jerk\nOutlaw what all the eighth or like\nThis one other thing about uh your relationship with as it happens you you uh\nDo just write letters to the editor you sent a selfie with your cows we we got that just a last month and a you're adding to our fiftieth anniversary\nOf being on the air we asked people to send us where they listen to the show and you wrote on your tweet never miss as it happens it's been on the milking parlor all my life meet my boy Oliver and twenty cows all becoming informed\nYes how are the cows feel about hearing you on as it happens tonight\nOh stores are hoping harmed on on NBC awesome opens on getting mixed up a lot of the state he buckle up hope I am\nWhat we wanted to do is use a ... and a system of ah using vaporize or is that would be safe and that we could control well in terms of the bills that we were giving to our participants because in in a joint you can have different doses\nSo we wanted to control that\nPart of the study as much as possible\nI Know the CIA funded study and they did some polling where they found that one in five young Canadians believed that they are as good or even better when they drive when they're under the influence of what do you make of that\n[noise] it's interesting because in in our study what we did ask them at different times ... also how they felt about their driving safety and the majority of our part that um didn't feel that they would be safe drivers and even after five hours\nThe they have some self awareness ability and that's interesting when we're thinking about maybe going through with uh some self awareness campaigns\nSo you didn't have those one in five young to know the other more no but also there they were they're aware that there is a test and so they're probably being more reflective ... on their life state\nYeah it might be the case you're right uh that they may be more reflective because they're in a study about driving and and and the use of Kennedy's so again I'm thinking forward in terms of public awareness campaigns and if we can\nIf they can be targeted to sensitized uh the public and the young drivers I think that's an interesting way one interesting way to go\nGiven your research given what you found out what what would what would you advise and the way of trying to teach young people about marijuana and driving\nI think that that bought the ... messages that if you are under the influence of candidates if you smoke or inhaling you shouldn't be driving\nAnd you should wait long enough period of time before Dr resuming you're driving in our case even after five hours a their capacity were still impaired so uh you need to uh wait to significant amount of time before taking the wheel again\nYou were looking at Eighteen to twenty four year old and you know you are interested in knowing how senior citizens who might be interested in marijuana for medicinal reasons as well as recreational I mean that are you looking to do some more studies like this\nThere are many studied needed but there are other groups that we didn't look at in our study so as you were mentioning a older I'm drivers who are using a Kennedy's from it is no reason a daily users of Kennedy's um these are all different groups and\nI don't know that we can extrapolate our results to these other groups where the impact\nOr the influence of Kennedy's may have different effect\nAlright well very very interesting information during this historic weeks we are in the midst of the rest of the other no thank you it's a it was a pleasure thank you\nThat was professor Isabel ... from the school of physical and occupational therapy at McGill University we reached her in Montreal [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n... long is struggling to sell something that once seemed like a no brainer Mr ... is Justin Trudeau is minister venture down mental affairs he took on the job this summer as what was once widespread support for liberals carbon pricing plan\nBegan to implode and the Trudeau government has put the plan at the center of its commitment to combat climate change but Ontario Manitoba scotch one and the odds are all now oppose we reached inter governmental affairs minister Dominique like now in Ottawa\nMinisters of that you had a broad presidential support for your carbon pricing plan was ambitious than they were on side now you have ... would be ... lining up to fight to even to take you to court what went wrong\nBut so Carol from our perspective um we have been consistent with Canadians uh and with our international in global partners to Canada must take urgent action to face the real challenges of climate change we campaigned on that and twenty Fifteen\nAs you noted are referred to in twenty sixteen the provinces a ball signed a framework agreement which spoke about a number of measures\nAnd some provincial elections have created circumstances where different governments are now saying that they want to take a different approach we've also said publicly that our provincial election doesn't actually constitute or climate change plan\nAnd we have told Canadians and we've told ... the international community that Canada was going to take robust us serious actions so we're\nContinuing towards the commitment we made around for example putting a price on pollution making polluters pay\nTo get back to what you just said because you said that they're they're taking a different tack you have ... years as a preview of Ontario or they want to be premier of Alberta who quite possibly will be the premier who are not just opposing you taking a different tack they are campaigning\nBy fighting the carbon tax they are putting out rallies come and fight the carbon tax they're raising funds for their campaigns on the backs of saying we're going to tear up this carbon tax idea so it's not just a little bit of pushback you have a full scale wind coming toward you\nSo again if some conservative leaders are conservative premier is want to run campaigns on particular issues they can explain to their citizens and be accountable for those campaign decisions I don't\nOr purport to understand or or speak for the campaign strategy of different conservative leaders across the country\nBut if conservative leaders and in this case Andrew sheer federally does not have any semblance or any coherent plans to meet the challenges of climate change\nOr telling Canadians we do and and provincial premier skin organized\nRallies if they want and say what they want it those partisan rallies what we're focused on a is bringing forward a very clear and robust plan to tackle the serious challenge of climate change which Canadians see in their daily lives is very real\nWe saw Carolyn New Brunswick with a historic floods last spring the wildfires in British Columbia the tornados that hit ...\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked healthcare in your community with convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think is at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here\nThe money back to Canadians in those jurisdictions where we apply to federal plan because provincial leaders have decided not to take their obligations seriously\nI guess I'm asking you is that yes it some of these ... years are actually campaigning on fighting the carbon tax or calling it the job killing taxes you know and they're being successful doing that\nIs it entirely their fault that people are buying into it that or is it the fact that possibly you're a liberal government the federal government has failed to make it clear to Canadians why you think it's necessary\nSo again the job killing taxes that was a phrase Mr Harper used to use all the time in the house of commons I remember that when we were sitting in the corner in third place he used to accuse the liberals have having all these job killing tax secret plans\nAnd Canadians took us from from third place to first place with a majority government and implementing a price on pollution and coming up with a robust serious plan\nThat deals with the real challenge of climate change is that commitment we made the Canadians and it's something that our government\nIs very serious about uh about putting in place and as I say I think we need to be careful if there were Thirteen premier of provinces and territories across the country\nJust because one or two or three find a megaphone and go to a rally we shouldn't cross infect other jurisdictions that are working constructively and positively with us on a on these issues\nBut it's not just a few premium is is that you've got for clean is against you you've got Ontario there's got to on prince Edward island plus now Manitoba I buy in Palestine just a month ago destined to do was celebrating him as the conservatives who gets it\nAnd then you've got Alberto gazing Kenny could take over next that's not just a few years more than half the Canadian population\nBut again I met Jason Kenny has to be careful not to assume the job of premier until he wins it in elections", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)",
