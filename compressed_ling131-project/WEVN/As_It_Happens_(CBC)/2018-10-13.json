Indonesia when he discovered was minimal Mr Smith also shown to wonder why you spotted but only with a camera we reached Michael Smith informed him surgery England\nAnd it's just misses you know there's been no record inciting as the one to a tree kangaroo since Nineteen twenty eight so how does it feel to be the first person in Ninety years to report having seen this animal\nA very surprising um it's a bit of a responsibility of coast because uh you know unless we do get some kind of consolation problems sorted out while I don't know what will happen to but they tongues to mine tend to wonder why mountains and the continuing demand so stuffed ... specimens say\nOh I'll just hype but it's not the last time it said\nHow did you discover how did you see this weekend\nBut that the year before looking for um ...\nSort of ... and I'm In the mountains of popular New Guinea and the Indonesian less popular and I was looking for the space of ... a month to say the wonder why mountains or they had a few days though and I'll just Google the name of this kind of grew\nUp I didn't say it but I decided I bought a comeback for an overlook another expedition or the or the next year\nAnd how did you is it just by chance or did you see it right away or I just tells the story of how you finally did see this animal\nAnd how to get a lot of time at some get permission from the white cloth autism the traditional London now I'm spent ten days in the mountain forest very tough going but hot the guy's a strike commonplace I I'm not like ... who I'm about to sit down for us um actually\nI only sold date the tree Congreve kind of the last hour of the last day before we have to\nGive out some pack up and go down the mountain\nAnd so this is the guy who was the ... and somebody from ... west ... who identified this is possibly the more you are looking for\nNew about trade Congress but it never seen one before because no one's actually being quite so high in the mountains I don't think um people hunger for another faceless ... down on the force of a bit more open but when you got above about a free thousand four thousand feet you got these were the ...\nThe second with ... ... ... that's not that's not much in the way of water supply so yeah it it was it was almost the kind of a a legend I'm even the local hunters\nNow in Nineteen twenty eight when Ernst Meyer saw this animal and what he did in order to do the research is he shot decree cheer 'em dead but it took the Palestine send it back the natural history museum in London to have evaluated so I'm presuming you did not do that\nA diet things that China or something or the or the rules of toughened up on on how to say no I had the ... which\nWas almost as difficult as well my I Would have a hot today um maybe a if we can get a proper expedition together\nSometime next year we can collect some of the ah the tree congregate dung and take it away for DNA Analysis because we felt a DNA from the original specimen that I've stayed in the natural history museum in London\nNot what Justin ... already telling me is more or less us in which has that says they are the same I Know what does this and she came to look like I always got to us up\nFace with I'm a bit of a of a short notice um a couple of short fluffy\nAre um insurance stuff they are in the arms and legs are quite close to click on to the uh the trees that Clemens around in the Bronx just on the title to kind of ... around the or the Bronx river of it goes along\nSome have described it as a cross between a bear and the monkey\n[laughter] um [noise] it doesn't look like I'm a I'm a monkey but it does for a bit like a a ... yeah yeah like maybe the foot of by the enough push-ups\nAnd ... and this is this as the global wildlife conservation says this is Wanda Roy tree kangaroo it listed as one of the twenty five most wanted last species why it's so elusive ... difficult to to to see this animal\nThat I don't know people have been talking about it for ages I'd just like a no actually you know I just thought it's a God though and have a look it's not easy going for the jungles of warm day why it and I said it's hard work um you got a sweat ... on your eyes on Lake ... any updates\nI'm On the flip around and uh um they wait until the time so a lot more to deter people a little bit of that ... if my ... in the park\nAnd is this is the only place where you can see this is the one to a tree kangaroo\nTiny area of isolated mountain forest um it's called a sale on three sides south I'm just lay the hundreds of miles from the the er the Smoky Mountains which is why they are the nearest relatives of the uh wonder what tree Congress found found out yeah not many people had out though\nAnd we had seen this speech instead but you have to do something to certify your your discovery is it is it for sure what you have seen is this is this the most wanted last species or or or how does this well\nOf course I don't know much about trick hungry so I signed up to five times and descriptions to some of the topics that smokes so they say kind of or that small stray there\nOf my life so that we're all the carbon that Wilson Frankfurt I start pulling a taxi\nAnd all of sudden and almost kind of a electrical shock I thought it was a shock and awe after the second electric could show I suppose is sick of it so\nIt's nice that you're talking about bullets being fired into your body aren't\nThat fight from behind then I read this scream\nA measure that could to warn that something was happening was his uh his client lonely area\nThat has a neighbor chief the beaches are way\nUp to the second show the church cave and that was still able to run or job chief gave me this\nTo kill I could not ... says I could show very weak and luckily enough I was hurt by the neighbor ambulances came on the coast on the phone all the hospitals had been shot\nOff ...

I must say that you know that this is a university so it's a big if you get pigeon that that's the way it reminds me it's about ... ... I was shocked but the ... case he has been fine because I\nKept that this is a whole case not the same time personal case but that principal ... which is empty cesium important which I also want to learn that should be detected decision\nDo you ever regret that you published a book\nNo no no that's part of a job\nHe said that is part of your campaign also for free speech\nThat's your job you know that's part or the ... that is part of the job\nSupport for an HP arts live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustain excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you online at or dash Reno dot com\nOn this journey God I Know you you got to get going say peace get talking that she will be following the case thank you so much by by by by\nWilliam the guard is the chair of the Norwegian chapter of the freedom of expression advocacy group ... you can find more on his story on our website CBC dot CA slash as it happens\nIn ... twenty twelve ... Joseph Anton he described Mr new guards decision and the decisions of others like him to publish the Satanic Verses as quote one of the greatest defense is a free speech of our time unquote\nIn September of that year Carol asked Mr roof devote his decision to go forward with a Satan versus in the face of so much fundamentalist outrage\nYou know I think there was a huge principle is at stake I mean freedom of speech is not just a cliche or I mean it's it's something without which all of the freedoms disappear\nIt's the bedrock of a free society and a force it needs to be defended [noise] um so of course but other principal is not to succumb to tyrannical bullying by anybody\nWhat sport because it's the first time I've read and understood what the threats where what you were being warned about when can you describe what was that there\nWas a very simply the reason I was offered police protection was because the intelligence services in England their analysis was that there was a very high probability that\nI Would be the target of the state sponsored terrorist attack organized by professional assassins in the employee of another state which is the state of Iran yeah and they said it's because you are under attack from another state\nThat the British states feels it has to defend against that attack and that was the only reason\nAnd these were in fact death squads there they knew that the Iranian government had issued with orders to find it until you\nThat's correct and there were several moments during this period of of of the protection when I was informed that they the police of the intelligence services believed that wasn't such squad or maybe more than one such go out into the country in order to carry out\nThreats and uh yeah I Do think that it's true that because I wasn't killed there are people who think that nobody has tried to kill me there and that it was somehow me liking to have all this full this protection noise around me that it was some of my ego was Dr idiots\nYou even had one life at the time now ex wife who perpetuated that that this\nTest it didn't help ah my hope she's ashamed to them but she's not that they will [noise] um I only have to remind you that other people were attacked that you know the bookstores in North America and in England that will bomb sometimes more than once\nThe endless threats against people in publishing companies look shows you know my Italian translator was was knifed and beaten and only I mean fortunately survived\nMy Japanese translates was loaded up his University in an elevator my Norwegian publisher who was shot three times in the back\nAnd my miracle survived but not just survive but made a full recovery was crippled you know this was actually happening\n[noise] he said at the end that it's hard to say whether this is the ...\nDrink or defeat life that well if you look at it merrily then yes I think we didn't do so badly there that's just said there was an attempt to suppress a novel\nThe novel is available in whatever it is forty eight forty nine languages [noise] those are the type to suppress the also that he's sitting here talking to you\nSo if you look at it to that level then yeah it was a well fortified should the end and at I managed to achieve a thing that for a very long time I didn't believe I Would achieve which is a mobilization of my life but also normalization of the publishing of that book\nBut if you will broadly at the kind of chilling effect that event I think that was one that is what I think uh\nPeople meeting people in the publishing industry are very wary of getting involved with the forces of radical Islam though but I think\nThere's a degree of reluctance to publish anything which smacks at all of a criticism of Islam or or even a pouch Islam so that's a longer awful I think ... which is absolutely don't walk in the early ... ray of hope I can find\nIs that uh I guess three years ago it was the twentieth anniversary of the top floor and they interviewed a lot of the western leaders would be an active in the battle against the book and I think with with no exceptions all of them said that they thought it it'd be the mistake they shouldn't have done it\nAt some of them said that's a tactical reasons they said that it could backfire of the community that has had made the community more popular at hadn't really getting them anything as far as ... just consider just made the most famous debatable up all money so they shouldn't have done it with other people actually seemed to have\nAccepted the free speech arguments in a note and said that they understood that either they would be allowed to say what they want to say was wrong with them to try and prevent other people from saying things that they didn't like\nSo that's what got you interested in Twenty years later the lawless everybody who had been involved in the leading the campaign against the book\nHad come to the conclusion that it'd be a bad thing\nFrom our archives that was ... speaking with Carol in twenty twelve [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Keene", "day": "13"}
