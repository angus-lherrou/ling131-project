many other high profile assassinations where there was an insult trader or the initial information saying one of the governor's bodyguard actually carried out the attack\nAnd this was the he was shot and heading to a helicopter he was with members of the U.S military\nExactly this is a high level meeting with the top us general in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller a he was apparently harmed but outdoor I like the police people killed\nAs was the um spicy or the province of them I mean and it's unclear what's happened with the governors all my we saw who but a ... at least been injured if not killed as well\nAnd so if we say is also dead and some are saying he is but he we we haven't had that confirmed and now the only time you just mentioned Abdul Rashid this is the leadership of Kandahar and wiped out in one fell swoop\nHuge growing sector of our our workforce who are in low income jobs that day you described it five times as as many people since Nineteen Ninety seven having minimum wage jobs but here's the question then I mean if the if your your belief is that if\n... it's all boats little float higher I mean that this will be good for business why don't businesses and that's why they why are they supporting an increase in minimum wage why are you paying your workers more the way you know we we we know that the old Ford motors\nSee me was that did you pay people a higher wage they'll buy your politics so why why should the government ... why don't you do it\nWell a lot of us are in fact on the ... the question came up and some of the some of the seals that's spoke to the other queen spark were forgeries the minimum wage I'm One of them some of them thought that\nWould be better but let's look at the advantages of a basic income over a minimum wage and not seeing that we should not increase minimum wage I think we should\nBe ... would be more universal so people caregivers are entrepreneurs people doing community service work people doing gig economy work quote all benefit from that versus minimum wage which only applies to a an arrow sector of employment\nSo what's going on with the economy is that it's not that robots will come to take your job or what what is not like what happened to my dad an uncle who lost their jobs in Ontario manufacturing sector it today so today what's happening is that a lot of people just aren't being hired from the beginning\nWhich means which means there's not enough local demand there's not enough local high paying work and all the experts I mentioned looking at the future of automation are saying that's going to get a lot worse\nAh so I think we need to look at ... as an economic issue not a social assistance issue it's a way to grow the economy create jobs make low paying work actually work for everyone so they can compete on a global level and they can actually find find work that suits suits them\nKind of person to say you in your own family is in ... when you when you write this letter\nYeah I mean I I have a quite a few stories they intersect with me I mean I grew up in a household that had a hot domestic violence I Wish my mom had the means to leave and I think if she had to think of maybe she would we actually see that in in the seventies it the base can come in the U.S almost passed under Richard Nixon\nIt it passed in the house the Nixon was going to sign it into law except it some of the experiments running at the time in the U.S and Canada show to an end significant increase in the divorce rate\nAmong married couples who have basic income because women were able to leave abusive households and frankly I think that's a good thing we also seen that happen in the trials\nIn Africa and Kenya right now a report of a greater marital harmony or we we've seen in the trials in India for instance women in the villages are taking off their head pieces like dressing more liberally and telling that the researchers that The Elders in the village can't control them anymore\nSo I think we can come as deeply emancipated for women but\nFor everyone because imagine if anyone imagine if you as the listener knew that you would never starve\nYou have this this money coming in and use no shame or on the money this is if everyone gets it if it's universal the way roads and and and police protection and hospitals are universal there is no shame and using that money to to stop take take a breather ... think of your life and think of what you want to do next\nUh imagine the confidence of self reliance the the ambition we can we can along the entrepreneurship who can release if everyone can take a long term perspective on their lives\nWill be watching to see is the Ontario cabinet responds to that in just a manner of speaking thank you thank you very much\nFloyd ... organized the campaign CEOs for basic income we reached him in Toronto\nAnd we received a statement from Ontario ministry of children community and social services it reads in part quote\nThe government for the people has committed to a one hundred day review of social assistance and poverty reduction strategies in Ontario best assist the one in seven people in the province who are living in poverty plan is expected on November eight twenty eight team unquote\nWith about a year to go before the next federal election any conservatives are on a push to introduce or\nReintroduce I guess their leader to Canadians and that means that you are going to be seeing and hearing a lot more of Andrew sheer and this weekend the Sunday Edition we'll be hearing a wide ranging discussion between Mr Sharon Michael and right\nInterview covers a lot of ground here's a patch which in which Michael asks the conservative leader about the disappearance and apparent murder of Saudi journalist ... ...\n... most concerning uh international issue at the moment facing Canada and it would face you of prime minister of course is the the murder the butchery of ... I'm In the Saudi consulate in\nIn the ... if you are prime minister how would you respond to that would you cancel any arms deals we have with Saudi Arabia\nWell you know I have to uh I have to be caught the fact that I don't have the same level some briefings that the liberals have in the ... he's aware of much more to the story than I Am to security and intelligence briefings and things like that I Believe though that this incident\nShould be a wakeup call uh about uh the government in Saudi Arabia and about it's it's um [noise]\nUh it's the role it's playing in the world\nI'm I've been reading a lot in this recently and uh it is very disturbing and when you look at what the Saudi Government has has has done in this case the the cover up to follow that\nI that this is alarming everyone should be concerned about this it that the idea that had happened to you know in another country not not in Canada not to again\nThat the Saudi Government plays a very significant role in geopolitics uh there are a lot of concerns about the sanctioning of of a terrorist groups and and and where the money follows a lot of that has come through\nA entities within within that country and I think that this that we all need to get together as as as western democracies liberal democracy I shouldn't say western because the fact structures all around the world for freedom loving nations should all come together and say we've got a big problem here if we cannot allow a government\nTo act with impunity in this fashion gruesome horrific ah doesn't begin to describe what happens\nNow there's an excerpt of conservative leader Andrew shears conversation with Michael n right which will be on the Sunday Edition this weekend you can hear the full interview on Sunday [noise]\nOh\nOh [noise]\n\n\nIn the festivities in Toronto park yesterday there was one character who stood out a tall furry creatures that bore a striking resemblance to poke through the BLM character from the long running TV oh children's program polka dot door\nBut it was four twenty on legalization day in Canada so the creature was not poker room at all it was to go to the creation of mark Scott who used to play poker roulette special promotional events we reached Scott in Toronto\nNot for those who didn't get a chance to see him letters took a look like\nWell choked to rule would be a play on the iconic poker room which I created a parody of and is a character who will talk about responsible drug use\nEyes candidates for recreational use there can be more discussion about responsible altered states\nHigh and so that for getting to the description Doug looks like poker for people who have not seen poker who don't have kids what does it look like\nWe'll poke who is a poker dotted kangaroo from a show called poker outdoor\nVery popular with everyone who has kids knows about ... ... and it was about ... he didn't know about token now so this is that this is what you will you were ... and you are token\nYes I was the um ... out of route land for TV oh and they're affiliated agencies\nAnd I got to meet the queen as poker rue I'm Colin Powell came to bring a program called America's Promise with a little red wagon as their symbol and um ... when he had his twenty fifth anniversary Saturday Night at the movies I I got to be part of that\nDo that now we never got to hear your voice which is really odd hearing it now\nWell yes because poker room or in most of the time until Nineteen Ninety six when he came out of new land talking was a\nSort of in the way and when I was told to talk I was given the instruction to be kind of like Julia Child and Kermit the frog [laughter] so it was a roof and yes mostly in send you waited like the summers in their day\nRight now 'cause we didn't imagine ... ah smoking a giant split with\nNo and uh that would be the evolution of the next generation where Tohoku grew and rainbow Lou ... who is death and does signing and ... who is with special needs character\nSo this was a project that I've evolved the character from him into an Internet program for eight to thirty year olds\nTable for the liberal cabinet I was in the conservative I I think all of it should be released and Canadians can see what was discussed on on all counts\nAnd what the icy and he has charged vice admiral Norman ... criminal reads the test for allegedly seeking to keep the day the contact on of course you have your colleagues in jest of these charges ... based on what\nI'm I have learned through the media that\nThere were investigations into leaks of cabinet secrets surrounding the who Trudeau cabinet and their decisions and that apparently some cabinet documents\nWere leaked but charges were not brought for breach of trust against some other civil servants it appears that there was a targeted campaign against admiral Norman he is the one facing trial no one else is even though the investigation revealed there were several\nLeaks around liberal decisions on on ship building he deserves\nAs any Canadian would do a full answer in defense writes both under section seven and eleven of the charter ... you know the the Trudeau government uh talks a lot of a sunny ways and transparency they have the ability to ensure that all documents released we don't care what's in them\nThat will be determined by a court so that he can get a fair hearing\nAnd I know this story was originally published by CBC News journalist at that time was James had more who went to work for a defense minister ... ... just weeks after that story was published is that what you're referring to\nThe that's part of the intrigued with this story Carol and you know Mr cut more of a reported on defense issues and have served briefly in the armed forces I Believe\nWas aware of of some of these discussions then went and worked internally I Know he wouldn't have been at the cabinet meetings what we're driving at his word or any discussions involving a Mr Bryson Mr Trudeau other members of the cabinet\nWith respect to this contract where they advancing concerns that they'd heard from interested parties all of this deserves transparency I think ah\nWhen someone's reputation and literally there's liberty is on the line we should air in favor of making sure his charter rights are respected\nVice admiral Norman is represented by marine had been very very good defense lawyer with ... for success or is it possible that this political interference doing is just a particular defense lawyer ... down in the ... case against declined\nThere is no question he has very capable council and in fact Mr Goodell said today in the house that our system works when things are left in the hands of defense counsel\nThe trouble is the liberal governments are tying the hands of defense counsel by not providing documents that are central to the case if the trust that was reached in this case is the trust and confidence around decisions a cabinet\nSorry you have to release those documents to see if indeed trust or minutes or cabinet memos were leaked\nThe government can't have it both ways they basically ran\nA very respected senior officer out of the military on a rail I respect the fact he's standing up for his reputation he wants to return to duty if the liberals are prepared to release these documents they should ensure that the charges are dropped because it's a farce\nI Will leave it there we will be following this story misspelled tool thank you\nThank you very much I don't know who is a conservative MP we reached him in Ottawa\nOoh
