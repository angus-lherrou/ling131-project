New York times on Michael Barbaro did today [noise]\nToday [noise]\nAnd the FBI prepares to share its investigation of Brett Kavanaugh with\nWhat the scoop of the investigation mainly for his confirmation [noise]\nWhy Republicans have decided to abandon their own regional strategy for how to treat Kavanaugh's [noise]\nThursday October for [noise]\nMy share what was the original understanding of the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh and its scope back when Senator Jeff flake requested it at the end of last week\nRight to essentially what Senator Flake had requested was really a reopening of the background\nCheck I can only say that I Would feel only comfortable moving on the floor until the FBI has done for investigation than they have already judge\nKavanaugh had been of course the subject of an original background check when he was nominated to be the next justice on the Supreme Court but Senator Flake essentially was saying to the White House and to the FBI look go back take a look at these allegations interview people that you need to interview to see if there is corroborating evidence that would suggest that in fact\nJudge Kavanaugh had committed sexual misconduct\nThere would be short\nAnd limited scope to the current allegations that have been made\nEssentially what the senators asked for was a highly focused re examination of this singular question of had the judge been engaged in actions of sexual misconduct when he was young\nAnd what did the FBI actually do at the start of this new phase is reopening of the background check a best case and so the FBI's\nProcedures and the FBI actual involvement is not something that normally becomes public law it's a pretty opaque process\nWhat we do know is that Republican senators had conversations with the White House the White House provided to the FBI for names of people that they said should be part of this sort of reopening the investigation\nAnd we begin today with breaking news and the FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh authorities are now contact possible witnesses as they prove allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against him those were ... a year old classmate who is accused Kevin ... of exposure himself at a dorm party wheeling Kaiser\nOne of the friends of Dr blow the Ford\nNotably miss Kaiser does not refuse Dr Ford's account and she has already told the press that she believes Dr Ford's account somebody named PJ\nPatrick Georgetown Prep class named his as I understand that I've been identified by Dr ... by the for it as a person that she remembers the day is a puzzle it was present at the party he described in our state and I said the Washington Post and they say in a statement today that make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct his level I guess ... cat and I also in the U.S\nActually the third person in the room during the alleged assault of Dr Christine Blasey Ford this is\nOne of the judge capital of the best friend at the time in high schools\nKavanaugh's friend mark judge has confirmed soon will cooperate with an FBI investigation as long as it's confidential [laughter]\n\nAnd what's happening with the FBI destination as these four interviews are being conducted what happens\nIs that as the FBI is sending their agents out and talk to these poor\nPeople this list of witnesses is only the beginning it's not the end of what the FBI needs to do and anything short of a full fair investigation will be a sham\nThe White House comes under intense pressure to make it clear that this isn't such a constrained investigation that it would be essentially a sham\nThey cannot say oh hey only interview the people in their neighborhood on one side of the street or only intervene people from a certain period of their life you let the men and women and the FBI the professionals do their jobs\nAnd for people to some especially Democrats is starting to feel like a sham right that\nPressure gets to be enough that the White House finally says that the president himself says the FBI can investigate this however they see fit\nI think they should interview anybody that they want within reason\nAnd they essentially give the green light to the FBI to go beyond just those poor people [noise]\n\nI mean like in the times since the investigation began\nThe public's focus and to some degree the Senate's focus has turned to Kavanaugh's credibility and his honesty during that hearing and the question of Dickey misrepresent is passed in a way that should be concerning for potential Supreme Court justice\nDo we know if the FBI investigation has focused at all on investigating his truth is our colleagues kick Kelly and Robin Pogrebin\nTold us that a lot of Kavanaugh's classmates\nHave come forward and tried to reach the U.S [noise]\nTo describe this behavior that they see as at odds with his efforts we drink beer and\n\nYou know so so did I say the vast majority of of people our age at the time but in any about one drink beer and\nAnd are still do whatever you know\nEspecially when it comes to this drinking and some of them said they weren't quite sure how to reach the FBI and we're having trouble actually getting a hold of people at the FBI so it seems like knowing whether the FBI has connected with them and bothered to talk to them would be telling\nIn knowing just how much the FBI is incorporating this question of truthfulness innocent education\nRight and I think we may not know until the reopen background check is officially completed and we see what the scope is that they've done as of now there is definitely evidence that suggests that a lot of the people who are wanting to come forward are struggling to feel like they're being heard\nSome of them are being told to simply file reports an online Web portal which seems\nOne person described to me is sticking a needle back in the haystack that that whenever they're going to say isn't actually going to get to the right people in other cases there have been names that have been given directly to FBI agents directly involved in this inquiry and yet the peoples whose names have been given have not yet been\nCalled by the FBI and so we don't know for sure whether there was a directive by the FBI to specifically focused on his honesty and whether or not he misled or lied or miss characterized himself\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in

in which a senator might say look I Believe his denials about the sexual misconduct I don't think he tempted to rape a woman I don't think he exposed himself in a dorm room but I also think\nThat when he sat before us for several hours in the Senate Judiciary committee and downplayed is drinking and now I've looked at all these interviews and I see the testimony of people saying the opposite and I don't believe him\nAnd just the fact that I Believe he misled the committee could be enough for this particular senator or that particular senator to say I don't think he should be on the court because regardless of whether I think he committed sexual misconduct you want somebody on the court who's honest and I don't believe that that's that's the kind of thought process that a senator could
