I think in her mind that was not the kind of temperament as she wanted to see on the high court\nFord um gave a heartfelt credible and persuasive a testimony it took a great deal of courage and also came at great personal cost her her\nPolitically there was obviously pressure and heart disease or cap on and I think it would have been more daring to have opposed to before the allegations I really think once the allegations came out that put her in a tough spot to support his confirmation\nI spent much of my life in public service focused on combating domestic violence and protecting women and children from\nActions right now aren't important signal to young girls and women across the country\nShe is a lot of her career dealing with issues related to sexual assault and you know she may be losing so significantly that\nHer ... wouldn't matter so if you're going to have a ... you may as well vote your conscience now would deny that obviously and she very much thinks that she's still a game but there's no question that she trail\nSo let's talk about what you've been seeing on the ground there in North Dakota yeah in a couple of days since senator Heitkamp made this decision take us through your trip there\nSo I got the Bismarck on friday and the state cap on the middle of North Dakota\nAnd then Saturday I went to to breakfast places in Bismarck and to talk to voters the first one was kind of a traditional diner or you know a lot of folks they're having their scrambled eggs and\nMore conservative place obviously there were a lot of support there for capital you talked to one fellow there who is very fond of hiking but there's no fan of Kramer all and he said he thought that Kramer would always all and he was going to support hiking him\nBought political he thought that she had basically see our fate by opposing capital\nOur place I went to was more of a kind of a lot ... place and I talked to one people for women\nGenerally Democrats or Republicans\nBrio before we're probably Kramer voters in ... was a high camp or any kind of illustrated to me the challenge hiking ... but he's one of the voters also no fan of Kevin Cramer said that she was on the fence but that one I keep emailing us capital\nThat was going to prompt her to make a grudging vote for Kramer\nWritten a reason is because of abortion rights because this person strong Catholic anti abortion and just could not stomach the fact that her senator opposed the confirmation of this judge at the same time enough lady at the table\nTo say I can't vote or I take a Democrat said that she would have been upset of Hi Kim how have opposed capital\nWhy\nNot deal with Iran\nAnd so that's the kind of channel that she was in you know in some ways are kind of damned if you do damned if he does\nWhen it comes to voters in North Dakota Jonathan what do you think\nDown to this is the challenge Hi Kim past\nPolitics has got more polarized as we all do but it's also got nationalized and local issues in a regional questions are increasingly less relevant and it's federal races like Senate races to more\nStraightforward question are you on the right team or the blue team and there's no question that it is a conservative state and that's what we are biggest challenge is to me well can still vote for her at a Democrat used to be a lot easier it harder now\nSo in other words try as a candidate might to keep things specific and local they may have no choice but to pick one of these national teams\nOf course you can pick one side of the other and you know in the past\nDemocrats more conservative parts of the country in the public and the more liberal part of the country for those lives they rely on incumbency could rely on the politics of personality you have to have a wedding charming persona that could really help\nThose things matter less now because politics is to want more nationalized and whether it's Republican\nYou know in a liberal state or a Democrat the conservative state it's not as easy to sort of create your own brand and void\nThe perceptions and assumptions about National Guard\nSo who's Kevin ... it's almost like the candidates are having to choose not just am I a Democrat or Republican\nBut am I with Dr Ford or am I with judge Kavanaugh\nYes there is no question about that that forward and capital heavy stand in for the red blue and if you support for that you're you know your team blue if he's fork out while you're on the red and again that is the last sort of issue that high can't walk to face here in the closing weeks of this campaign\nShe wanted to keep this raise more local\n\nWe'll be right back to\n\nThe daily supported by Baird employee owned and independent bad has kept clients financial interests first since Nineteen Nineteen I W Bayer to dot com
