the one thing that always affected her ... laugh\nNo I have friends that have had something like this happens to them or worse and they've only gone to me in a selected group of people about it because of the fear that nobody's going to believe them that their parents are going to be angry at them for whatever reason\nDid any of you find that you wanted to talk about any of these encounters and you found the people around you\nWeren't believing them or the questions that made you wonder if they believe Jew or you're just fell on a nerd\nYeah ever yes\nUm I've always wanted to talk about it and\nI have like I've gone to my mother and talked about what has happened to me but\nWhen I told her she said should have been like out that late where you should have came straight home and so I kinda stopped telling people who I wanted to tell like my other family like close friends of mine because I feel as if my feelings and what had happened to me was invalidate in that\nAre you comfortable saying anything more about what happened to you don't have to\nI was walking home from an evening out with my friends it was around like maybe nine thirty ten\nAnd I was walking and a man who I didn't know he was a really old man and he approached me and I first I thought it was like super funny all fun and games because he but post me says oh you look like a sexy\nBritain and I'm like I don't know what that means like ha ha but then he\nLike pulled me into like it wasn't like kids how to like the driveway nexus house\nAnd he pulled me there and I started to get scared I tried to fight back but I was not as strong as him and he was a very like um he was very built and then like started to like try to kiss on my neck and tried to like touch my books and I got so uncomfortable but\nI was capable of getting out of that situation because of a stranger that was walking past and I started screaming for help\nBut feel that to this day I kind of I'm Still impacted by it because\nWhen people even go near me I'm silly I don't want you to get him very uncomfortable and you just\nYou chose to tell your parents and people around you about it and and\nI took my mother as soon as I got home 'cause after this incident I kinda like ran home today I guess there was adrenaline I usually don't run\nBut there was a journalist and I was running and as soon as I got home my mom's like why are you home silly and I'm like this is what happened to me she said you shouldn't have been out too late and after that I kind of just stop talking about it\n\nSo I Want to shift focus your two to three sensitive\nOne of the conversation surrounding these accusations against Brett Kavanaugh is that\nThis was high school so how much\nWeight should\nIt carry given that context and I'm curious what you think as high schoolers\nShould what you do now should what anyone in high school does now follow you around for the rest of your life\nYeah yeah because I feel like like obviously I was like a rite of passage\nAnd you've got to make mistakes and learn your way through it but there are certain things that it's just like like say hateful things to certain minority group than things like sexual conduct\nFollows the victim forever to follow the victims Robert well then you've got to do with it too says it's your fault you know what I mean\nWhen you're sixteen Seventeen a senior in

making a decision to do something wrong or you're conscious and making a decision which is the same thing is going to be doing the rest of your life [noise]\nI Wonder what you think the message was\nWhen Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed many of you have talked about the experiences they happen to you or to people you know\nWe're a salt and given the fact that he was accused of that and he was put on to the nation's highest court what's the message to you\nFor all we know it could have never happened but the fact just so the fact that he was accused shows that anybody can get away with anything as long as they have enough power\nUh-huh that like people that um that are watching him might think oh if he got away with that I tend to because if he did it\nMaybe I'm not going to get caught maybe like even if they bring me to like a trial like I'm I'm going to be good because look who is now our Supreme Court justice he got away with it so I don't mean to me\nIt's kind of just feels like a big old our really care about your situation type of things from like the higher up than the government and stuff it felt like we don't care if you like it or not you have to take\nIt and like it feels like they don't care about our opinion or safety is the fact that we're even here even though we make up like a big percentage of people and it feels like they're kind of just like well
