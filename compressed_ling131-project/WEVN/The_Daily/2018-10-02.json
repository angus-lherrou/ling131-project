E. N.\nA. T. E.\nAnd the question was what was that right and this person sent me the photo and said at the time these group of boys bragged about a young woman named or not it and having all had some kind of sexual interaction with her that was to brag and that was why they had a so called club\nAnd Kate is you're trying to get a picture of Kavanaugh in his high school days how many people did you actually talk to and how eager\nOr those people to talk to you know we made many many phone calls before we reached people who were comfortable speaking about it there was a general sense of reluctance and a lack of interest in stepping into what was becoming a bigger and bigger national controversy\nWhy do you think of as what do you think explains that reluctance\nI think the Georgetown Prep alumni community is ultimately very tight knit\nThat graduating class of Nineteen eighty three with only a hundred guys and I think there's a sense of pride that comes with having one of their own be nominated to the Supreme Court I have heard this from people who say look I'm a Democrat but I still take pride in judge Kavanaugh being nominated surpasses politics\nAnd Robin where did you start your reporting after Dr ... the Ford makes her allegations knowing your connections to you\nSo soon after Dr Blass before it's allegations surfaced we started getting tips about the name Deborah Ramirez that she also had a story to tell and\nAs a result I started mining my Yale history and sources and to begin to ask questions around the incident as well as more atmospheric information about what those two were like in college freshman year and afterwards\nAnd as you're talking to a former yo classmates what are they saying about who Brett Kavanaugh was in college what kind of person he was what his behaviors were\nWho they're describing is a person who was very much of kind of a party guy known for partying hard in fact the people I talked to said I party right along with him on they didn't necessarily say they were angels in comparison there was heavy drinking he was part of it so are they\n... and just how hard drinking and partying was according to people you talk to\nYou know what ... number of people said to me ... was the one at the keg he was a guy standing by the keg doing what drinking a lot and actually what was interesting to me was that you know one source said to me that Brett wanted to be the guy who got the girls and he wasn't the guy who got the girls so he tended to drink a lot\nAnd to some extent use disrespectful language when talking about women but no one could remember anyone he had dated so there was this kind of an interesting picture of sort of all want to be\nMan about campus who actually really was known for holding up the walls that was a phrase I I heard a few times and what does that mean and that means the guy who was so drunk he needs to stand along the wall because if he came away from the wall he might\nWas known for holding up the walls [laughter] [noise]\nAnd I caught a nominee Brett Kavanaugh outbreaks in silence for the first time\nFor me I found that right after Brett Kavanaugh appeared on Fox with his wife and portrayed himself as something of a choir boy\nWhen I was focused on trying to be number one in my class\nOn the top to the ... do you do in my service projects going in church the vast majority\nInformation started to shake out in a more overt way where people were sort of proactively calling me and saying wait a minute that's not the bread I knew one of them went so far as to say you know you can't lie or way onto the Supreme Court\nUm and what did they think was the lie you know basically that Brett was whitewashing his past\nWhatever time that you're trying so much that you couldn't remember what happened the night for no\nCause I never happened never said that he was\nKnow that he was portraying version of a young person that they did not recognize and they felt was disingenuous and that that went to the level of character\nAnd it spoke to someone's integrity and truthfulness and they thought it was important information for them to share they may not have stepped forward otherwise but this was a bright line he crossed so then came to hear\n[noise] your for the ... just before the movie will be the truth the whole truth and nothing bugs or from soil to God\nAnd for me and my personal reporting process the hearing was a really galvanizing moment Adam dealing with these Georgetown Prep alumni who knew Kavanaugh at the time\nSo many of whom had been reluctant to speak before all of a sudden I'm getting inbound calls saying this is not an accurate portrayal we wanted to stay out of this but this is just over the top ... during the hearing he was asked about red knot and what was meant by those were not alumni references and he said\nShe was great friend of ours bunch of us want to dance with her she hung out with us as a group\nShe's a dear friend that we really respect I'm really upset that this has been taken out of context\nThe media circus that has been generated by this thought in reported that referred to sex it's not\nThe people I was talking to who knew him at the time cried BS on this they said Brett Kavanaugh spoke about her disrespectful east so did his friends it was not at all if he's presenting it and that's just ally in
