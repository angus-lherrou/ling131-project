P. R. dot org you can also gives us a call if you'd like to talk to someone\nEight eight eight eight zero five six four seven seven to everyone out there who was already made their contribution thank you so much for your support\nFrom the New York times on Michael Moore but this is the\nSenator Jeff flake last minute demand for an FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh\nSinglehandedly held up the Supreme Court nominees confirmation\nBehind that decision [noise]\nMonday in October first\nMy share of where things stand on friday morning [noise]\nSo friday morning the hearings that had happened on Thursday\nAnd here because I Believe it's by civic duty to tell you what happened if any have and I and I were in high school\nRemarkable testimony by doctor was before this whole effort orchestrated political and the emotional an angry response from discovered that hits it can play\nI intend to vote for you and I hope everybody who's fair minded\nWill the Republicans were aiming to move ahead as quickly as they could to try to push judge Kavanaugh's nomination forward ultimately to get him confirmed so on friday morning\nThey had scheduled a meeting of the Senate Judiciary committee there are ten Democrats on the committee eleven Republicans on the committee to Republicans as of friday morning we're very confident that they have the votes\n[noise] the one exception to that with Jeff Flake all eyes now on Jeff Flake the only undecided vote on the committee where he is a Republican from Arizona but he's retiring in part because of what he has expressed frustration with the lack of bipartisanship in Washington\nHas railed against President Trump used those really harsh rhetoric and so while he is definitely a conservative on policy matters\nDo sort of a wild card and yet even though when everybody woke up\nThis is breaking news about the boat that's coming up on a judge capital\nAnd nine twenty nine Jeff wakes office put out a statement saying that he had decided to vote\nJeff Flake Republican Arizona will vote yes say he would support cabinet and because he deserves a presumption innocent with boards allegation uncorroborated\nHe would provide that crucial eleventh vote to give the Republicans are majority to move the nomination forward [noise]\nSo he begins to head to the committee room for the start of the meeting he gets into an elevator from his office heading up to the second floor the dark and Senate office building and he's in the elevator with a couple of age before the elevator doors closed\n[noise] and my two young women confront him my heart and they confront him in the most personal way [noise]\n\nThey essentially start yelling at him that his vote to approve judge Kavanaugh was an affront to women that you were telling young women that their stories about sexual assault didn't matter\n\nAnd in fact they started talking about their own experiences\n\nAnd this was captured on video which was quickly released and went viral and you can see on his face that Senator Flake is grim faced staring down at the floor of the elevator trying not to sort of catch their gaze at one point we one of the women says\n\nLook at me don't look away when I'm Talking to you and he glances a crust fall and I mean you can see the weight of this decision that he had already struggled with for the last week or more absolutely come crashing down on him\n\nIt was clear I think to everybody that watch that video that however difficult the decision had been for Senator Flake up until that moment it was immensely more difficult for him after that episode\nRespond [noise]\n\n[laughter]\nIn terms of having maximum impact it couldn't have been times better and it is certainly true that members of Congress get feedback all the time they get feedback from constituents that get phone calls that come into their offices\nSo it's not true that they're completely isolated from what real people think but there's also usually a distance right especially when you're at the Capitol when you're in Washington\nLawmakers sit up on the diet is in the hearing room they're both above the audience and distant from the audience and the discussions about public policy and the big momentous decisions they have to make are often\nDone among themselves and out of the direct contact from the people that they're going to affect and this was a reminder for obviously Senator Flake but also for the rest of us ...\nDoes much distance as we think between the decisions that the politicians we elect to make and the people who they affect [noise]\nSo after when I'm sure felt like attorney to Senator Flake he sort of escapes the elevator and the doors close and he heads you know this year in what's going on in that room [noise]\nSo the hearing has just been gaveled to order by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa Republicans are assembling on one side of the diet Democrats are assembling on the other and all of them are settling in for what they expect to be a kind of pre determined outcome\nEach senator on each side gets a few minutes to pontificate and so Senator Grassley recognize Senator Dianne Feinstein she made some comment\nThank you Mr Chairman I'm very disappointed to hear today voting on this nomination and then it went to a Republican senator\nAnd the more than twelve years a judge Kavanaugh has been a judge on the DC circuit his reputation for honesty courtesy and integrity\nAnd then it went through a democratic senator it goes back and forth each appointment to our nation's highest court as with all others just simply too important to rush to vote\nBut even as the back and forth is happening the Democrats are leading for some kind of a delay\nYou investigate\nGets the least thing a sexual assault victims is entitled to when she comes forward\nThey don't understand why an FBI investigation couldn't take place\nAnd I have conveyed to my friends and colleagues that I had wished we would take a one week pause one week only\nChris Coons of Delaware suggests that a one week FBI investigation could help provide some clarity and the Republicans are essentially rejecting that out of hand\nSix FBI investigations and we miss the sophomore junior gang rapist\nWitness that\nMuch garbage\nThere's nothing that the FBI would do that the committee hasn't already heard\nWe made a decision to vote or one thirty if there's some reason to change that and we'll have to change it but I'm I'm not even getting a discussion about that right now fair enough and then what [noise]", "show_name": "The
