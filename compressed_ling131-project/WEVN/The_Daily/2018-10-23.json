B. S. is that he provides the justification for the relationship he\nIs the best possible face for all the flaws in messiness of the Saudi Arabian United States alliance\nBut in these actions he seems to be emerging as a figure that would embarrass the United states so why would President Trump not attempt to exercise greater influence over his hand picked leader of Saudi Arabia after this series of events\nI think President Trump would argue that Mohammed bin Salman needs the opportunity to establish himself to consolidate power\nHe's operating in a tough part of the world but above all I think the case he would make is that on the ultimate strategic issue of combating Iran which is the centerpiece of President Trump's Middle East strategy\nMohammed bin Salman is a critical player member in Yemen Saudi Arabia is fighting the who the rebels\nWho these are backed by Iran so it's important in the fight against Iranian proxies in the region tat Saudi Arabia support and so to the extent that Iran is really the big prize for President Trump Mohammed bin Salman is his wing man in that effort\n[noise] so what's the message that this inaction by President Trump sends to momma didn't Solomon if he knows that so long as Iran is being taken care of everything else will more or less be forgiven\nWill the messages that he has a free hand to do whatever he wants and that is above all the message that NBS has taken for the last twelve months\n\nAnd that brings us to October second when Jamal ... a dissident Saudi journalist\nIstanbul fifty nine year old journalist one to the conflict with his Turkish fiance to get documents to their upcoming marriage the fiance waited outside for five hours until finally calling police\nJamal to show he never comes out of the Saudi conflict and what we know now is that when he went inside\nSo he was not it inside the consulate\nAllegedly by us Fifteen man Saudi tainting they ride that day and left hacking in the evening\nHe was met by Fifteen operatives who had been sent from Saudi Arabia [noise] with the purpose of interrogating him and perhaps rendition ... back to Saudi Arabia or perhaps simply to kill him and dismembered him which they did\nWith the bones saw that one of the group had brought with them and his body was taken out of the Saudi conflict in pieces in a crime that has riveted the entire world the world\nIs watching and waiting\n\nWe'll be right back\nThe daily it's supported by penguin Random House audio dedicated to producing top quality audio books Christina downstairs vox the newly released novel from Fiona Davis the masterpiece and been mcentire she's the spy and the trader are available more at try audio books dot com slash book club\nAnd by ... bourbon handcrafted in small that just for a full flavor sipping experience forty seven percent alcohol by volume Elijah Craig Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey large town Kentucky think wisely drink wisely\nYou're listening to the daily on an age ... yellow and tune in to MORNING EDITION tomorrow morning as an HP are written gambling speaks with income a democratic representative any Custer\nAbout tariffs I also spoke with her about health care policy you can hear that conversation tomorrow on all things considered and yesterday Rick and I spoke with Republican challenger Steve Negron about those same subjects you can find those conversations at an H.
