this and he just I think decided I'm just going to\nPick up where I left off and do you know how he was introduced kind of how the roughly what words were used and how the audience reacting what's your regular ... to ... the the hosts something like you know uh\nI'm actually really excited there's no need for an introduction you know this guy as we've given up for everybody [noise]\nLadies German you know the guy from his show on FX please make ... something like that you know there was no fanfare [noise]\nAnd\nDo you know how the audience responded yeah that you [noise]\n\nYou know any of the examples of a joke he tried out during his performance yet that parades about tipping waitresses that what is it just that we're not very startling Mrs in a way that\nThis will be constructed in the media and correct me if any what's wrong he he does a familiar routine he does the step that is classic Lucy K.\nHe mentions whistles and one of the things he mentions is a joke about a rape was all so it sounds like classic Lucy gay despite the fact that those kinds of jokes have a different entirely different residents of the I don't think he was tuned in says\nThat the joke was about his daughter said some that you know that not all whistle for clean what about the expression clean as a whistle and so we started talking about different with all this kind of with all that was All right with all that down so clean and that led wasn't a rape joke by any means\nMhm well it sounds like it was a performance that did not address what I Would regard as the elephant in the room they didn't address at\nNightline\nComedian Louis the gay surprise that parents had a comedy club just months after admitting to allegations of sexual\nMisconduct there was no threat to women

criticism is coming in or you\nIdentifying what you like meaningful criticisms and push back yeah and and limited in what are they saying yes so some of the people felt ambushed mhm you know you can imagine you wait all week to go out to a comedy club on Saturday Night\nAnd you walk into something which really really upsets you when you're angry at the place for doing that so what I've done to\nAnswer that is that we have a very clear policy centuries has swim at your own risk we don't know who's going to pop in ... if somebody pops in your liking you can leave no questions asked your check is on the house we don't want to upset you\nSo nobody can say there were a captive audience which would infuriate me to other people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian\nAnd I'm like okay when do you think he could come work\nOur he says never I said well could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again if I don't care never missed even admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a say so what you would say\nParticularly to a female customer who is somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton who was credibly obviously accused in Juanita broader I mean I think nobody will expect a warning before he shows up somewhere nobody\nLike why were they sharing Roman Polanski as they were for years why were they giving standing ovation with ... that are after accused of sexually abusing the accused ... he did it\nBut behind all these people you're mentioning Roman Polanski the film director Bill Clinton the president Luis became a comedian\nIs someone who gives them a stage and in this case that's you rub on had nobody cares that Mike Tyson who raped or convicted of raping somebody performs looking only control the venue you control\nYes but but it's not unusual to\nExpect some consistency in the world and when you see wildly inconsistent demands if it's so obvious that the guy who Nass debated in front of women and expose itself and women should never work again but it sounds like you're saying\nWhy should I Know I'm the owner of comedy cellar do something out of the normal way of warning an audience\nWhy should I be from now when I'm warning you know mhm I said that but even though I Will do that do not expect people to be warning people outside of Bill Clinton that's what I'm saying I don't want my customers upset but the overlay this entire moral structure on it\nAnd they presented as if don't you understand how the world works and I look around at the last you know that's not the way\nThe world works in the world very much picks and chooses so I have two ways to handle it I can either get involved in that ends on this person can perform this person you can reform and explain to them well how come you let norm go on and you you know I'm going to become a hypocrite overnight mhm or\nI tell the audience this and this is the comedy cellar it's unfiltered and\nWe don't want you here not understanding that it's not the end of the world to see somebody that you don't like or that you ... you know but if it is in the world for some people it may be based on their their traumas in their own life are the things they know it's just too difficult\nSo then this is not the place for them to come or you can come and just leave
