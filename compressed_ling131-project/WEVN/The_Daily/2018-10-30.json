{"month": "10", "state": "NH", "station": "WEVN", "content": "And one of the people who caught on to that sort of pet they raised with Donald Trump junior who had a thing for ... eating a lot of neo Nazis interestingly enough on Twitter he posted this on September tenth and there have a right in the middle of this show solidarity with the ... right\nRight with white supremacy we've gone from dog whistle to fall on barking\nAnd because I knew it I could see things out there in the campaign that other people would just go right by I mean ... for instance there was a moment where\nDonald Trump is facing backlash over this tweet that included the star of David the tweet shows the Jewish symbol over images of Hillary Clinton and dollar bills the message over the star says most corrupt candidate ever\nA lot of people said wait a minute that's a Jewish star this must be an anti Semitic reference\nMegan the debate boils down to whether or not you think a six sided star looks more like a star of David or a sheriff's badge\nThen they said oh no don't be silly that the sheriff star but because I was\nTrolling around looking at the images on these alt right websites I knew exactly where they had gotten that it wasn't some innocent thing they didn't stumble into what they went looking for that image and somehow thought that was a good thing to send out [noise]\n\nAnd then the final campaign that candidate Trump ran his closing statement for the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nPolitical establishment with a new government controlled by the American people\nDark dark at that spoke of global special interests coming after America\nTo control the levers of power in Washington\nAnd for the global nationally they partnered\nAnd as they ran ... words global special interests you saw the Jewish faces of Janet Yellen the Federal Reserve chairman of Lloyd Blankfein the chairman of Goldman Sachs and of George Soros the Jewish philanthropist mhm three Jewish images\nComing on top of those words global special interest it was just hard to mistake\nAnd we will take back this review and we will make America great again [noise]\nI'm Donald Trump and I approve this message\nBut I guess they're still kind of a plausible deniability perhaps to something like that and the Trump campaign whenever they were called on it by reporters always said you were seeing things that aren't there\nThat's right and remember the plausible deniability always came from the palace men that is a bunker Trump\nYou think the president does not like using a prejudiced against you think about the president of the United states you bet and you know why don't why why do you know why they hate us on the way\nThey say what wait a minute Donald Trump has a Jewish daughter in a bunker he has his son in law who was an Orthodox Jew he has Jewish grandchildren how dare you accuse him of anti Semitism\nSo what is it for though if the president does have a Jewish daughter and Jewish grandchildren and the Jewish ... how do we understand what you're describing\nAppeals to anti Semitism in an ad like this being president in the campaign\nI think Donald Trump had a very hard time turning his back on his most ardent supporters\nHe and his campaign understood that they had really riled up the far right the alt right and that included racist that included an anti Semite\nI'm not going to choose them of racism or anti Semitism but I Will say that when confronted with the darker sides of his supporters he was always very reluctant to denounce them to push them away\nAnd that in your mind is just purely about an electoral calculation by the president by those around them\nIn my mind I Do not think that Donald Trump feels like he can waste lose a single vote\nSo for me Jonathan as someone who did not have the kind of\nAwakening that you did because of what happened to you on Twitter there was talk of anti Semitism during the campaign but it\nOften felt a little ambiguous and I actually remember vividly when that change\n[noise]\nIt was ... it was a white nationalist rallies that seemed like it was about race but suddenly you had all these young white man [noise] marching in unison and chanting\nFront [noise]\n\nIssues will not replace [noise] and I remember being truly confused by that chance like why are white nationalist talking about Jews it did not make a whole I sent\nIt made a lot of sense to me [noise] why\nBecause there is kind of a pantheon of evil in the old right in this new breed of\nNeo Nazis and in that pantheon\nThe watch word is white genocide that they believe that the white race is being supplanted replaced watered down\nAnd they also believe that the white race is superior to Latino is to blacks to anyone who is not white right and remembered Jews in their mind or not white\nBut they look around them and they say well wait a minute if we're the superior race how could it be that these brown skinned black skinned people are succeeding in white genocide are replacing us and that's where they look for the\nPuppet master and they find the Jews the Jews in the ... world are the ones who are orchestrating the white genocide maybe not the field troops the shock troops have white genocide or brown skinned black skin but the orcas raiders of white genocide are Jews\nThat's why Jews will not replace us\n[noise] so what's the connection why are Jews now seen as the puppet tears of Syrians Mexicans et cetera\nWell you know one of the central tenets of Judaism is\nRemembered the stranger for you or a stranger in the land of Egypt it is actually part of the religion to welcome strangers to welcome immigrants are welcome refugees\nAnd actually American Jews really created the concept of repairing the world to tune alone and this kind of welcoming response to\nDid the Nineteen fifties to African Americans who were then during the civil rights movement [noise]\n\nI was the rabbi all the Jewish community in under the regime\nThat most important thing in my life\nThat bigotry\nOn the most urgent problem\nThen\nThen disgrace\nShame for the most tragic problem\nIn the civil rights movement was a seminal moment for Jewish and black alliances\n\nAnd yeah and that has tremendous resonance to Jews and to el fighters and civil rights and it also has tremendous residence for the alt right who always seen Jews somewhere in the background orchestrating their demise\nWhat's kind of complicated about this discussion is that I was so prepared to have you told me that all these troops you heard about were factually falls but what's really tricky about this conversation and hard to grapple with is that Jews in America\nHave done the things I welcoming outsiders that they're being accused of doing by these white nationalist in ways that completely defy\nAll of a simple hate but what white nationalist believers at these things you were describing are being done not out of altruism not out of a kind of spirit or generosity but to undermine white people they see it as something being taken away rather than something being given\nExactly it all fits into the alt right world of white genocide\n\nWe'll be right back to\nThe daily it's supported by homemade visor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to a major role
