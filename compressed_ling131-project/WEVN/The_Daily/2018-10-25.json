{"month": "10", "state": "NH", "station": "WEVN", "content": "To turn it into a majority in the house of representatives so remember we had twelve years a Republican presidency like eight years Ronald Reagan in four years of George W. Bush\nAnd we elected President Clinton in Nineteen Ninety two and nude understood that in the mid term election with a Democrat in the White House there was a great opportunity for Republicans to win congressional seats and\nWe're here because we are taking the first step\nThere are things issues the Republicans could run on\nAnd we're taking them in a contract with the American people\nAnd new devised a contract with America which I worked with him on quite a bit to help give people something to talk about\nEvery item in our contract you supported by sixty percent or more of the American people this is a contract with Americans for America\n[noise] but the main dynamic was sitting President Clinton the number of things that aggravated the conservative base tonight I Want to report to you on the progress we've made\nAnd they turned out to vote for Newt saw that that was going to give us seats that we had never been able to win before\nDo you remember specifically what things Clinton was doing that was riling up the day we ask the well off to pay their fair share\nUm first of all he raised taxes and that was a bad thing\nIf you send the legislation that does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can never be taken away you will force me to take this pen details of legislation and we'll come right back here and start all over again San of course the failed\nAttempt to pass Clinton care which was probably the biggest negative issue and then there was some social issues\nI Believe that American citizens who wants to serve their country should be able to do so unless their conduct disqualifies him from doing so\nGays in the military and things like I think that we said they couldn't imagine we're really controversial even but back then they were\nRight and then after the town I remember gay marriage being pretty prominent issue\nThis is not prejudice legislation the defense of Marriage Act does not mean spirited or exclusionary it is a preemptive measures to make sure that a handful of judges in a single state cannot impose an agenda of ... the entire nation\nAnd another one that I remember one so called social birth abortion yeah and I'm curious how much thought where they just don't think his shoes because they certainly didn't seem arbitrary\nYeah well you're not wrong first of all the central social issue really was and in my judgment is abortion\nMhm in the immediate aftermath of roe versus Wade the ... right to life movement United around the notion of amending the constitution to ban abortion over time\nPeople figured out a couple of things first of all that there was not going to be political support for amending the constitution and second of all that there was a political support for banning abortion but right fly for much still was quite United around trying to minimize abortion\nVision should be a ...\nBill Clinton you know ran for office saying where abortion is safe abortion should be stable illegal and legal but rare and rare book\n\nFelt the need to use the word rare because he understood people were an easy about abortion even though they did not want to ban so binding\nAway to try to restrict some abortions without banning abortion across the board resulted in the focus on late term abortions which most people oppose that most people\nThe term partial birth abortion means the person performing the abortion partially that generally delivers a living feeders before\nKilling the fetus and completing the delivery\nNamed partial birth abortion did not exist until someone who wanted to ban and abortion procedure made up this erroneous and inflammatory term\nWhen it came to these particular late term abortions what seemed to me either very clever\nOr devil loosely cynical depending on your point of view\nWas that it force Democrats to articulate a position on abortion\nAnd its most extreme which then painted them into a corner\nYeah I I think that you're basically right about although I wouldn't that's not the words that I Do is you know we we have the term Reagan Democrats back in the Nineteen eighties and the Reagan Democrats essentially were southerners that used to be Democrats\nBlue collar northerners mainly Catholics that used to be Democrats crossed over and they voted for Reagan well in both cases there were Democrats that were at odds with the liberal consensus\nOn these social and cultural issues we've been talking about\nSo you take a democratic politician and you'd put them in a very difficult position if you force them to come front and center on some of those issues because it created a wedge between their liberal base if you want to use that term and the more traditional\nConservative cultural voters so to force Democrats to confront those issues you know was a winner for the Republicans no question about it\nYou know it's funny one of those early memories I have from back then was seen Patty Murray and very liberal Democrat from Washington state who is trying to remember her she was a senator who was voted in during the era of the women\nAnd I think she was the avatar of progressive promise and suddenly the Senate was voting on the defense of Marriage Act\nAnd she like the majority of Democrats was voting to ban gay marriage and I remember her coming off the Senate floor and being surrounded by a scrum of local reporters and she looked pretty miserable defending her position\nYeah the ... well the Democrats were definitely tortured over those issues and a lot of them change their position to conform with a more liberal cultural view and that accelerated the movement of cultural conservatives into the Republican Party\nWere no longer your Reagan Democrats or Bush Democrats [noise] they were Republicans\nFeel how do you think the strategy has aged\nWell that's a good question I I think that yeah I I think that there are some issues words\nContinue to work but I think that there are some problems that the Republicans face long term because of the changes in the culture the most obvious I think and it's a place where I think Republicans are changing as on\nOn the L. D. V. T. Q. issues\nI think that those issues I I don't know if I'd like to say that they have aged well or poorly I I Would like to say that they presented a challenge to Republicans going forward even if in the short term\nThey are working it would seem to the benefit of President Trump and the Republican\nSo you were anticipating where my mind was moving which is that certainly his latest two thousand for gay marriage seemed to be working in the Republicans' favor but as you're pointing out millennial Republicans now more\nAnd many older Republicans are keeping mum about this issue I keep thinking about how John Case it during the debates [noise] you know gave this response when asked about gay marriage where he just basically said that his God told them to love everyone\nI I think I think that the gay issue is\nA little different than some of the other cultural issues\nOne of the things that's happened is that everybody today\nKnows gay people that was not always the case where these people kept it hidden\nAn awful lot of the Republicans you're talking about are confronting a different reality which is this is no longer a logical issue or theoretical issue this is about my friend jak gr my friend Linda or the people that I Know\nLooking back on it do think that they were on the wrong side of history\nYeah I mean I don't know when I Would say yes\nThen more broadly do you think that maybe other wedge issues are short sighted I mean because that was one of them\nWell I don't know I don't want to broaden by response on that you know I don't want to say that is true of cultural conservatism generally I I Would not extrapolate\nWe'll during [noise]\n\n\nThe daily is supported by home advisor matching homeowners withheld improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major models homeowners can read reviews of local pros ad book appointments online at home at ... dot com\nAnd by fracture creating modern photo decor and gifts by printing photos directly on glass a fracture is an mh frame andme out all in one hand made in a carbon neutral Florida factory learn more fractured me dot com slash daily\nYou're listening to an H.
