of property records deeds and mortgages and transfers on every property of her own going back for six years and got all those buildings here there's the house that he owns and this is an aerial photograph of one of the buildings I assume like go\nHome and then there's bank statements tax returns detailed accounting Rutgers where we can follow where the money's going\nOkay so I Know this has been a sprawling complicated investigation but I Wonder if you could just boil it down for me what is the big question that you had been trying to answer\nFor all of us the question always comes back to watch the actual ground truth about Donald Trump and how he got rich\nMy father gave me great knowledge didn't give me a lot of\nThe famous go to talking point but Donald Trump says I started with a million dollar loan beside his father loans from a million dollars just stopping easy for me it has not been easy for me and then he passed away about ... million dollar loan into this ... billion dollar empire\nMy father gave me a small amount of a million dollars had I had a back and I went back with interest\nAnd when you turn over the rock on the\n... and I did it by myself it was just totally untrue bay\nBut there's there's more to the story than just Donald Trump caught more from his father than previously known\nYeah from the documents we gathered we were able to honor the pills about Donald Trump's wealth but she has worked very hard for very long time to keep it and\n[noise]\nColleagues ... to ... and David ... have spent\nWere a poring over never before seen documents as he investigated President Trump's financial strain\nToday the story of what they discovered [noise]\nIt's Wednesday October third [noise]\nSeptember twenty third two thousand sixteen let's just chaotic day for me at the time so it was closing page one story that day and in between going from one place to another I stopped at my mailbox\nAnd there was one piece of mail there and I grabbed it and I looked at it and it was from somebody at the Trump Tower [noise]\nAnd I open it and it was three pages of Donald Trump's tax returns from Nineteen Ninety five and I just stood there [noise]\n\nAnd I've been working with my colleague David Barstow on a couple of other stories I immediately went over to his desk\nI remember I was on the phone and she was trusting news papers coming in front of my face when it dawned on me what I was potentially looking at it I was like oh my God I\nMeet somebody hung up do you believe voters have a right to see her tax returns before they make a final decision\nI don't think they do but I I Do as a candidate\nDonald Trump broke with forty years plus a tradition by declining to release his tax returns\nClearly his tax returns tell a story than the American people\nDeserve and need to know that is\nRemoved from the public record one of the main tools that we have traditionally used to scrutinize the finances of our\nPresidents and I'm at some point or they came over to me told me they had this thing they want to talk about and we went into a small room\nAnd what was it like to see those tax papers for the first time it was totally [noise]\nThe New York times published three pages from the candidates Nineteen Ninety five tax return they showed Trump declared a nearly nine hundred and sixteen million dollar loss\nThese three pages were just like goals because they were the only glimpse we had into what he told the IRS about his well a loss\nOf over a hundred million dollar almost a billion dollars in a single year\nThat moment ... looking and starting to feel by more and more layers of the story of someone from the money\nYou may have heard that we've got some significant breaking news tonight\nSo six months later in March of two thousand Seventeen Donald Trump is president and Rachel Maddow late in the day sent out a tweet saying she's got a copy of Donald Trump's tax returns\nWe have his federal tax return for one year for two thousand five and so we were all like holy cow or if you have to live for any kind of he made more than a hundred and fifty million dollars and not air ...\nRaise interesting questions to us\nThe personal tax return that we have from Nineteen Ninety five showed that he was bleeding money by two thousand and five it showed that he was making significant amounts of money\nSo we started trying to figure out how does a guy go from\nHaving a loss of nine hundred million dollars plus in Nineteen Ninety five to booking a hundred and fifty million dollars of income in two thousand five what's going on was there something extraordinary that happened in his life that year and then we came across this little smattering of clips that mention that in two thousand for\nDonald Trump and his siblings it's sold their fathers real estate empire Brooklyn for over six\nThat's interesting and it made us want to learn everything we possibly could about that particular empire\nAnd we start reaching out to people who have been involvement empire disputes with it worked for trying to\nReconstruct a fifty year history of red Trump in New York City\nWe started going through these documents previously unseen documents and then we called people again and again and eventually we're left with a detailed view of Fred Trump's empire no one had ever seen before\nAnd\nSo tell me about Fred Trump Donald Trump's father Fred Trump is born in Nineteen oh five from the Bronx the son of immigrants\nAnd friend at a very young age becomes enamored with the construction business just sort of an incredible thing by the time he was Fifteen or sixteen he started building how is it not just like as a construction worker like overseeing the whole thing [noise]\nThat day a day for America and her alive\nThan when World War two and we saw it on the name of this world and throughout the country\nThere's this huge demand for housing for returning veterans\nNone of government offered developers low cost loan\nTo encourage them set up by some in the building blocks of middle class housing Fred Trump became one of the country's largest recipients of those federally subsidized building\nAnd he immediately launched on making these huge projects with low interest government guaranteed loans and keeping the costs so low that he was guaranteed a life of extraordinary well [noise]\nSo as you're going through all of Fred Trump's documents at what point does Donald Trump up here\nDonald Trump starts to show up in his father's business affairs when he's three years old in Nineteen forty nine\nSo what the documents reveal to us was that when Donald Trump was three years old he was actually read Trump's landlord\nFred Trump gives his children the land under these massive apartment projects that he's built and then begins pain them\nRent and as we begin tracking those payments we see that those payments may Donald Trump the equivalent of a millionaire and today's dollars by age nine and things just keep coming out um [noise]", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "03"}
