u._s.\nPublic can they can reveal the\nDemocrat was going\nTo reveal something where that we call for me [noise] on October [noise]\nIn the middle of the night at about two thirty in the morning Thursday this much anticipated report the FBI investigation into whether or not judge Brett Kavanaugh committed sexual assault makes its way to the White House and there's just one copy of this report\n[noise]\nIt gets sent over to Capitol Hill and it winds up in this book your room this room that's called us gifts sensitive compartment did information facility that is underground room and the public can't go in\nThere are these huge kind of brass looking doors with signs on them that's the you know no media\nOr public and this is where the senators review classified information and this report is being treated like classified information Sheryl ... covers Congress for the time so the plan is that\nRepublican aids and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa\nOr going to be able to go in this room for an hour and review this report\nAnd then at nine o'clock the top Democrat on the committee Senator Dianne Feinstein and her age can go in and view this report this is going to go on and on all day long with Republicans and Democrats\nAlternating hour by hour in and out of this room reviewing this single document\nThe system doesn't seem especially a fish and actually it sounds kind of odd\nIt does sound kind of odd but the whole day up here has been really kind of surreal\n[noise]\n\nSo I arrived at about seven forty five in the morning and the first thing I did was I dropped my computer off in the Senate press gallery where I have this microscopic little desk that\nLooks at least I have a window though it's great I have a window which is which is really a prize thing in the capital but I did my computer and then I went downstairs to the basement\nYou make kind of a right hand turns and go into the visitor center in down another set of winding stairs to wear this gift\nIs and by the time I ever to secure a room and by the time I got there at the place was already crowded with reporters and it was clear that you know this kind of bizarre\nWhat's going to be unfolding all day but more and more senators are rising and see more of more reporters and photographers and\nJust a lot of\nEmotion\nEnsure wants to send there's actually make it past the media and they get into the secure\nWhat are they looking at exactly what\nThe process inside that route Michael if I knew the answer to that I get a pay raise [laughter]\nYou know it's so secretive that no one would tell us but I did find out the documents were forty six pages of interviews and the FBI\nTried to reach hadn't witnesses they got nine nine of those forty six pages or devoted to mark judge but as to what it actually looks like\nWe don't know and they were so cautious that\nYou know they wouldn't even describe that kind of ACT UP how did they all look at this you know single documents\n\nSo there's a big fuss when they walk out and reporters are have\nBring them with questions and some of them are White House are trying to escape they don't want to say anything we're running after them in the hallway saying you know what can you tell us about this report what's your take on this or did they interview and you know kind of elaborate\nReally nobody is saying anything\nSo what do they tell you well basically what we're\nGetting is [noise]\nThe Republicans come out and their line is\nNothing in these documents shows any form of cooperation of the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nSharon in reaction to the other senators\nCome out Tim Scott of South Carolina he says oh I feel even more comfortable than I felt for for the danger of Montana says well there's no ...\nWho requested the supplemental FBI background check got what they requested and sort of on and I am ready to them and on and on\nThe fact is a doozy allegations have not\nBeen cooperating Mitch McConnell the majority leader goes to the Senate floor and he declares\nThat Sherman ... side of this morning maybe that the Judiciary Committee\nIs located in a third parties are going to adjust to any of these allegations\nIt's time for the quotes hardest history on us to stop at times to confirm judge Kavanaugh\nAnd so Republicans are also kind of taking this one step further\nBut while we were doing everything we could to treat Dr Ford with the dignity and respect that she deserves our democratic colleagues did her a huge disservice\nThey're saying that they're the ones who did a better job protecting women that they didn't leak her allegations like the Democrats did\nWe know Dr Ford requested confidentiality but our democratic colleagues deprived or about against her will\nThat they offered to fly to California to interview her and a setting that would have been comfortable for her and would have maintained her privacy so you know they're actually accusing Democrats of running a what one of them I think Chuck Grassley called it a demolition derby\nAnd we're just about\nDestroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court\nSo for the Republicans share all the message is that the FBI report confirms what they already think that without definitive proof that an assault ever occurred\nKavanaugh should be considered innocent and because there's no definitive proof this has all been a calculated attempt by Democrats to hold up this nomination and smear Brett Kavanaugh has time for all that to end and for this guy get confirmed right\nAnd what about the Democrats how are they spending the FBI report on there\nTo speak out I can tell you I'm very and not leaving messages designed to get to that you weren't back so the Democrats\nAre saying this is an incomplete investigation that it was never intended to find the truth\nThere only ten people recession started that people out there that the question said\nThere were many more witnesses out there that the FBI could have interviewed", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily", "city": "Keene", "day": "05"}
