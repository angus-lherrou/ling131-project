Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim and I'm sure you're familiar with\nMuch Mr general secretary though my pronunciation may give you difficulty the maximum is do vi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\nIs that she can I ask you if\nYou were the fat at every meeting [noise]\nFrom the meeting a Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and Rick how Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allow this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent\nAnd a conservative Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person\nOr when you think of ... a Gorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua or in the sense that um you know\nWhen I was in government uh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't get rid of the policies\nBut the decency of demand the humbled and is the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with Trump's policies which I don't but even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or this\nIs probably sorry are probably some who city and openly quality and the president or they're hard\nTo say though there will disguise Joshua\nAnd uh the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved immigrants and his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country and his whole address was about immigration how wonderful it was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having tariffs at any time and he was very intense ... reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were classic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican I'm Donald Trump but anyway this style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him\nAnd very proud to be there with him on that weekend in record back in Ninety six\n... author of Reagan Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and Ford\nOlympics were talking to us okay now learn how to spell recommend are extra what I'll work on it I think very much very good bye [noise]\nWhat do Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we study them for a very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal following ... they were controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and they are revered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common perhaps that's the paradox of leadership there is no one formula and no one checklist that defines all leaders\nStanley McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan from two thousand nine twenty ten\nAnd he's the co author of the new book leaders missed and reality alongside Jeff Eggers and Jason men go and he joins us to discuss it General McChrystal welcome to one a it's an honor to be here Joshua we'd also like to take your questions and thoughts\nFor the general about the nature of leadership and we'd love to know to some of the leaders are that you look to that you try to emulate or is that you follow whose leadership attributes you think are worth highlighting comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W.

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader and some using the word\nHero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted\nIf a quote unquote leader fails to lead but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous we think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders\nThe dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then the short conversation he\nJust reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way he made me feel better I think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubs your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be the military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they asked much sometimes they demand a lot but typically they give alongside to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say are we demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right absolutely\nYou can have this list of traits or behaviors and the leader can use them and on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context is changed the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team\nAnd the situation the second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe but what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and\nI thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and I would therefore be the star but when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that\nBut I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that have played upon that\nWhat I concluded was the leader still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today we treated a little bit like\nSupport for an H parents live stream comes from you our listeners and found service credit union supporting businesses throughout New Hampshire from

there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven door so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nWhich very calm and I mean if you think about it every body a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece\nHe wanted the basket and that and it was a natural problem but it caused a huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWe're speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders miss and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie emailed good leaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comments she's reflects something that a John Maxwell describes and the five levels of leadership

U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one a let's start with that title Trump the blue collar president I think it might be an odd image to call him blue collar considering everything in his house is gilded\nBut I don't think that's quite what you mean by that yeah well\nListen I mean I tried to pick a controversial title I knew that the um the people on the on the left side of the political ledger\nWould be upset with that title because Mr Trump has a gilded toilet and um\nThe apartment looks like Louis the fourteen smoke crystal meth and then decorated the apartment so I knew that would upset them by some footage and ... yes yeah but I but I but I titled it that way because they grew up in a blue collar neighborhood I have blue collar parents that never went to college and\nMy dad had an hourly workers job when he got started in his career and and the people that I grew up with a really like them and they support him even to this day and so\nI think there's a message in the book as to why they do that um and and listen you know I uh I Try to open my mind up to everybody's fought and everybody's idea I'm not close minded I understand the president as many flaws and I understand that people\nOn the side of the aisle that don't like him I understand why but I think the book has an important voice because the people on the other side of the aisle they don't like him I Would suggest that they read the book\nSo that they could get some sense for why he's at forty seven percent and climbing and why he's tightened up a um what could have been a blue wave these tightened up that race and made it a\nCloser and why he's getting countless thousands of people to show up at his rallies I think what's important for people who really understand it well I I Will have to agree with that just hopefully they can understand\nWell and I I think I understand where you're where you're coming from with that point it kind of\nIt makes me think about I don't remember if I don't know if you've ever seen Citizen Kane but if you think about the character of Charles foster Kane when he starts to go into politics part of what gives him a serious chance of winning and of course he he fails because of another scandal but it's this idea that he starts to articulate\nFor people who feel like they're not being heard you can argue with his politics but just as ability to speak to people and have them go yeah what he said that's what we've been trying to get you to hear\nI'm Audie Cornish concerns over voter suppression in the mid term this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nThat's this afternoon from four to six here on an age PR\nFinally with some rain for today high temperatures in the forties that will be mostly cloudy scattered rain showers tonight and low temperatures mid to upper thirties [noise]\nThis is an HP our\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Fidel investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more at ... dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services LSD\nAnd from math ... him committed the changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day in nine hundred franchise locations ... dot com slash NPR\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're speaking to Anthony Scaramucci about his brief but impactful of time in the White House in his new book Trump the blue collar president we welcome your questions for Mr Scaramucci and acknowledge that there are quite a few of the audience who are questioning our shall we say\nEditorial choice to bring Mr Scaramucci on NPR duly noted you can spend the time to complain about the gifts that we pick which is you're right\nOr you can spend the time to send us a well thought out incisive question\nFor this man who has some insights into Donald Trump why he won and why he feels that it might be a playbook that even his political opponents might want to pay attention to should you choose that route you're more than welcome to comment on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nOh this or that or a quaint and ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say what is written to run it threatened to run yeah LA's a higher than run for president are are going to support Romney because you know I've decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little night Georgia about the word for it and not he floated the idea or he hinted at a friend's threatened\nYeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party\nRun that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but ah you know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person as a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle\nYou know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lotta time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas\nMade a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side and it weakens my argument\nThat I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going a lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from them\nWell and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is a communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that it pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be having it he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for hand full that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda yeah no no no question\nI mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know\nLike if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there was to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so having the free press there\nTo observe leadership is a check on their power and that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody we did so it it's out there was a ... page plan that basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press\nAnd servicing all parts of the press so it didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN they had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch so I find in the square that though I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted previous and ban and out of there I made it very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I Would have been happy to do that I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody that General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ...\nHaving you know your General Kelly like I I I I think\nEven be on that list but in the ... going to like me any more than he likes the price of oil and your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press he could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean\nI get the sense that the president just didn't agree with that [noise] um no actually\nNo such thing as well there's a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on\nI'm sitting in the oval office with them the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... directors over at him and I alone in the office I'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey\nIt's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI Lived in a while you declaring war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media first of all you're gonna lose that war\nSecondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up\nEverybody gets in a defensive posture I said well were you way better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him but for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with Leslie stall let him\nHave a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had them in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that once said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president so there was a lot of people inside the ... like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these\nStories that ...\nMay be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On seeing inaccurately and and clearly and consistently over\n... listen I just left a morning show where these guys like but they they rail on them all day and night and so and they're calling him a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly that would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we had to do then is you've got to tell them straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and the people that don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are\nGood and when you get to a few more comments I Know we've only got you for a few more minutes but let me get to some more\nFrom our listeners Michelle is listening from Hudson New Hampshire\nMichele emailed as a fairly strong

about making millions and Powerball we are speaking to one of our guests who we will refer to as Sally to protect her identity whose family one eighty million dollars in a lottery before we bring in a few more of our guests and get more from Sally let me get to a few of your\nComments in terms of what you would do if you won the lottery Steven wrote on our Facebook page I'd check off every vice I've never dreamed about\nMentally wrote on our Facebook page I'll never win because I don't gamble no lottery for me and Jim wrote on our Facebook page I'll take my chances with finding out if I can handle the wealth or not\nSally or love you to respond to Jim's comments in terms of finding out if you can handle the wealth wants the money going into your parents' hands how did they handle it\n[noise] and that's a great question and I'm I'm going to agree with him I'm not gonna lie everything that you know even if I say something negative about the wind today I Am not going to lie on such a hypocrite yes we have a ticket for tonight's drawing\nHuh one why is that well you know wait a minute wait a minute you already one wind blowing up the newly you win the lottery ... when was\nIt was it may it it it's interesting because you know when people hear a million\nYou know I I never realized how much it decreases like if you take the cash option that Uncle Sam had hands out like I Need Fifteen times in that first year it just it really dwindle deal no\nPlease don't get me wrong I down and she was or not to tie and all that but uh [laughter] you know but I Will say that\nIt it I'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents didn't share a small portion with my brother and I you know that means that my kids can literally choose any\nPrimary and secondary education gold I won't go to any school for any amount of time they can do anything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that sure drain\nDo it you know ... and that's an absolute blast that my husband and I both being and solve for sales we would have been able to afford that any way but it's nice to have that cushion right\nUm [noise] so there are blessings but I Will say that women has shown me personally the absolute\nDark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women that I have actually experienced it I'm sure my parents would have many many more stories um\nAnd in speaking about my parents it it's strained relationship you know I've chosen to become\nExtremely private about\nThis when my husband and I moved to a different town to just kind of get away\nBecause my parents want in a state where you cannot remain anonymous and for them that with habits because they love to brag about it they love to spend lavishly like it's like look at bay\nWhere I'm more of the exact opposite and some of that is just out of fear either I'm I'm\nKind of fear based anyway heat I worry about the people that are going to kidnap your kids for ransom I worry about my parents someone hitting them over the head is making sure everyone stays home and\nI'm going to know I I Know we got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the store was where your parents bought that winning ticket and say something to them before they bought it what would you say\nThing that I Would tell anyone who won tonight or if you won two million dollar wine two billion dollars that doesn't matter I think it\nThey absolutely need to have the typical advice that you hear you know surround yourself with a great paint a CPA a financial adviser and attorney but not\nBig it vice would be to be careful these are not necessarily the people that you went to high school with him in office is in a strip mall are handled your last or or whatever\nYou know he'd had yeah the scale of your new state has to match their ability to serve you\nAnd you know if you can't remain anonymous consider options that allows you to remain as non them as safe\nAs possible and then you control the message out you know I I Know that there are ways to do it and I think the last one is to just be aware of people's actions no matter how subtle you've gotta create your own litmus test he becomes your tried fried rice not your close family and it's not your ...\nI really do appreciate you sharing your story with us despite your decision to remain anonymous Sally we'll call you about Sally we appreciate your sharing that with his thanks very much for talking to us\nThank you good luck to everyone with a ticket including us\nTonight
