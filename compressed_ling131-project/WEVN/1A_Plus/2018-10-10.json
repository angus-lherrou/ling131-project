Michael\nBut um [noise] we can't say that the American\nDirectly related to global warming but we can say is that ... these ... increasing at the results of global warming because we're all my atmosphere has no energy can hold more water or\nThe chances that base so that the extreme events sweaters harkens to or extreme Rangel or heat waves are increasing with three little bits are wanting\nMe to a few more of your comments Sarah emailed I feel overwhelmed by the talk about climate change\nAnd don't feel like there is a unified voice out they're letting families knew what concrete steps they can take to make a difference for our family this has led to ever present feelings of helplessness anxiety and guilt about the choices we make every day Sarah we will be talking about some concrete options in just a moment but let me get to a few more\nThoughts that have come in the far Joel emailed\nYou should stop framing this as what will politicians do politicians reflect the people that voted for them half the voters in the U.S read Donald Trump's tweet that global warming was a Chinese hoax and voted for him anyway that just goes to show how important the issue as to the people in this country\nCruel Davenport I Wonder if you could respond to Joel's email I mean the president has committed to taking us out of the Paris Agreement he kind of questions the provenance of the agreement by saying well who wrote it up let me see who wrote a now believe it does Joel have a point\nBeing the policies that address climate change on the U.S really isn't a a distinctive place right now I think I'm Around the rest of the world we do see an expression of will by leaders\nTo um enact policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions I think\nThat there's a lot of questions on how strong those policies actually are\nUm you know the analysis shows that they're they're not strong enough to limit warming even to that that initial two degrees but they you in the U. S.\nUm what we see is President Trump not only you know essentially questioning that the basic established of of climate change but but also moving to undo existing climate policies\nI'm President Trump has already moved forward with policies to undo regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants on undo or weekend um regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from cars\nUm and he had said that it is his objective to promote the use of coal burning coal is one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions a President Trump wants to promote the use of coal in the U.S and abroad um one of the findings\nOf this report is that in order to um limit greenhouse limit climate change to\nUm you know to to to the sort of a lease\nDestructive um level of warming um the use of coal will have to uh\nBasically go down to zero I'm by by twenty fifty ... basically no more on just about no more coal um and and and it is you know that that is that is an extremely disruptive\nPolicy recommendation um there's no question that there are industries and people who will be harmed\nWho who will have their livelihoods disrupted by policies that go in that direction\nAnd and that's just sort of started to shore call but I Wonder in terms of the politics behind this when I hear you on are are totally hear you on how disruptive versus what poll is so\nInterwoven in the network of America's energy grits kind of hard to just drink it all out I Wonder though in terms of the voices on the world stage who we we know that there are forces who are saying well poll it'd be really hard to pull out\nTo get the sense of there's anyone in the world stage saying tough our planet is only home you light pole tough we got to get rid of it deal was on you or ... or so Jerry Brown the governor of California for sure\nAnd many of them and you'll know crying I'm the president of France has sought to kind of a step in and um\nHe he's trying to carve out a place for himself as as a as a leader on climate change it's it's not difficult for France to take that position because France um doesn't really use coal\nUm so but but but we I mean we absolutely see world leader saying you know this is what what needs to happen um [noise] in China it's very interesting because um China is the world's largest\nUm greenhouse gas polluter and is a massive user of coal at the same time we're ... the the Chinese government has moved forward with I'm actually in acting um prices on carbon ah they're they're they're an acting a cap and trade system that would force\nUm carbon polluters called polluters to essentially pay a tax or a fee I'm a ... in order to pollute which is designed to drive the market away from from greenhouse gases an idea that was invented in the United states but is\nI'm considered sort of politically toxic here in China they can implement it by ... they don't have to deal with a Congress voting against it is\nYou want to talk more about that idea of carbon taxes we continue in just a moment but let me get to a few more comments or Brian emailed\nWe have no leaders anymore with the skills or courage to do what's right regardless of the political cost we will keep polluting as long as the price of fossil fuels is low\nWould be interested to hear from some of you listening who you trust who you think some of the leaders are politically in this country around the world who you believe are sincere in their pushed to do something significant about climate change is there anybody that you think is for real and saying that we're going to make this happen or maybe if you were active with\nA politician or a government leader or a government agency it's doing something tangible that you feel people should know more about we love to hear from you what gives you hope\nThat climate change is something that is actively being worked on where you are email is one a at W.

trying to make an impact with the fight against climate change here is a little mash up of two of the messages we got this is Amy from Chesapeake and Jeff in Michigan listen\nI'm getting a thought to get ... thoughts feeling powerless and the daily stuff that the path of destruction that Iran\nI pessimism comes because I Believe that what's happening to the world\nIs happening at a corporate level and I'm Still more companies get on board and care about the environment it feels like we're kind of on the inevitable I have um two thousand forty will be here before we know it and we will reap the consequences\nThanks Geoff an Amy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want to a\n[noise] good to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council\nIt is a group or that is co founded by a by actually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution is pushing for a carbon tax or all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the backers of the council where does the funding come from\nSo um the council is ah does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the\nAh oil majors the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest a solar company in the United states a very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers\nAnd of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker shields carbon demands planned but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that has a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon\nAnd that is connected to the organization or use it as they spin off but is there still a connection\nSupport for an HP ours live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustain excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you online at or dash Reno dot com\nLobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nColder before let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council was advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for what exactly is a carbon tax\nShores so um [noise] the idea of a carbon tax is um ... each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere\nUm you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes um and ah in in ... and important note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house\nHe's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday or the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of\nEvery ton of carbon um\nTraps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much each kind of carbon hurts a the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs\nThat it it can range from um fifty dollars a ton to a hundred dollars a time when I'm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost but once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are can essentially um create attacks\nUm above a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters of carbon dioxide no no no a carbon\nMuslims are going to be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car maker do I pay\nThe war's almost ... pollution from automobiles does the carmaker pay a carbon tax for producing the vehicle that ... carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gas and loaded term I actually\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm older and and and and you you would so um we don't have carbon taxes in the U. S.\nUm so in some ways this this is sort of um you know in intellectual debate although other countries are are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is um if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon\nCarbon outside would be a produced by burning 'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd it mounted gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of your gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would\nDrive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars\nNot because not out of some sort of a moral sensibility but because actually a ... a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nHosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money lobbying Congress for a price on carbon give us a sense of what the plan involves and why it's getting support\nUm the bigger shields carbon defense plant is based on four pillars the first is a robust carbon tax starting at forty dollars per ton which would actually be the highest carbon tax of any a leading emitting country all of the money would go directly back to the American people in the form of a carbon dividend\nWhich means that the vast majority of American families including the most vulnerable would win economically from this plan\nAnd a third pillar is that we would trade a high price on carbon in a growing price on carbon for some of the carbon regulation simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nThe law just wanna make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it with my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then that the revenues from that tax would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of a of a dividend is that what you called\nYes so a family of four would get approximately two thousand dollars per year in dividends and here's how the system would work\nThe more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs are planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy would all of it just come back to us as taxpayers\nA hundred percent would go back to the American people\nAnd that is what makes the plan a popular and politically viable because in ... on Capitol Hill you'll never get the two sides to agree on how to spend the revenue Republicans will say well let's spend on deficit reduction are lowering the corporate income tax Democrats will say well let's spend it on\nA renewable energy innovation or a low income support\nIt opens up Pandora's box by contrast when you returned all the money directly to the American people it closes that box and what polling shows is that it's overwhelmingly popular most interesting\nW.

for that has second ac that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons it's kind of a date moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there\nFlash back to er sad about LA\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things were asked to go out in front of crowd or for people and you often hear you know you need to be dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger\nAnd at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment it we can personalize it whether it's your interview or what have you and I think that was an important or with\nHeather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight\nSo she owned it she was like this is my name is all me to take me as I Am and she worked at it you know got tend to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of an ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that alley billboard and he says we should have just made the old billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist and and thrive in Hollywood as far as coming up the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie is place in time it's interesting to think about that because\nAlmost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's\nReally no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less power than they used to so it's almost like the old fashion and its view of the music industry\nBut only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really\nTackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars form or just kind of want to be in on the conversation she tells\nBradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose your nose just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink who's very much and invention of pop music but who also had this kind of rye cynical filed style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that the view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one\nI'm rose to fame there is one path you just simply a sand or D than as opposed to there's no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional path\nThat um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of how to construct it that way and what you're saying about lady God you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able to make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean\nThe funny thing about this movie as she is way more important to share than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from Bradley Cooper just had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way\nYeah except for that voicing rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diverse but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley send a lot of time sitting up\nThat first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga is character alley is just improvising love saw him they send\nA kid can\nTo [noise]\nWho's really been though [noise]\nBradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and saying and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we saying together I mean everything's why we say we sing everything live in the movie wow you there's nothing wrong with thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene in the actors fully believing that you're the character you can't not believe it yourself so she really gave me that confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he's a stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar do Kevin Cavanaugh KCUR and I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism and stayed with him it would be more interesting he's\nFrom her former employer really what they want if they want to sweep us away and we were [noise] you know we were staying on the county that's next time money here now

listening in Indianapolis hey gene what did you think of a star is born\nEnergy and can you hear me yes I have five stars which wife five stars [noise]\nUm actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was that continually say and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over\nThe manager down agent played yeah what what is your main character I didn't like him\nPost too but the minute he had that conversation\nWith Jackson um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship I just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent of ... and I I think I heard you chime in as well\nNo that was mailed to go yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of the story one of the tricks with the manager is I think\nThey do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is I'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nFrom the beginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element\nThat it doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed it because when he's been through these\nUm recovery process is does it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell\nAnd there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on stage to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nLet's all go ahead and going well of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster as Lady Gaga once called it and one of her album a destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all of the virtues of the SARS weren't have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost it was a sympathetic enabler\nUm of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know\nWe're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the star is born versions\nSo the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of being part of the cast you know has to be there um I also just want to say before\nSupport for any PR it's live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustained excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you online at or cash Reno dot com\nThat lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say it that even as Jackson, Maine is saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically\nFrom his young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushed the periphery feminist rating problematic\nFound well but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a failing male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative guys nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made main character's advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nHis scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performances especially the musical ones were fantastic and the cinematography was incredible\nI expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography cinematographer Matthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been out score original song and editing\nJohn horn spoke with the cinematographer Matthew ... about shooting live performances which are not really straightforward spaces to navigate\nHere as a part of that conversation from Cape PC sees the frame\nThis film was very difficult to sort of navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with the lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot in between two sets with a real audience apologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between\nTwo bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashion was able to ah create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled um scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency my my goal was that um you know in creating a a character from St Louis and with our resemblance\nJackson, Maine might as well be um [noise] oh I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that the\nThe audience maybe supposedly filled that this is his lady [noise]\nThis is his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement them but a representation of rock and roll\nThat was Matthew ... the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape he sees the frame\nJohn can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is well directed this kind of a film the way that Matthew described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed film shooting in so many different kinds of locations", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Keene", "day": "10"}
