A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren's story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA result\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to end these comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of the arguments that split fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nInto the air go ahead for them it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to add to what Alexandra saying I mean look this is what happened in two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook them out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh we'll\nGive you the way in which um you know the parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling the gifts so they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael ... an Alec Baldwin and they we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've let people who've drawn the most attention of the people who've cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term to\nOh against all on the question of Trump another politician who at one point was in antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail\nWas Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke people are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Frank over ... ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know try not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking him about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas\nUm it's been a major shift in tone for work but it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants\nA you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for Beto O'Rourke some some hope\nIs like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nIran as a progressive Democrat like over ... has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved to need a little\nI mean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in terms of typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think an undercover aspect of this race is the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go in a box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength as Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running you know against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over arc had been able to keep them to single digits\nI was going to make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically counts that vote dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically built for every Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they would do on Monday and the results\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers outraged Ninety two Republican incumbents more than sixty\nThe quarter in the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans ... raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nAlso glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Karen tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there are still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town and Mexico beach has not report it given any numbers\nUm of how many people are are missing 'em but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nWas a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms out of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that ... you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service um and people are expecting ass film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they are expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nWhen Alexander the other big issue is when people can actually start\nTo rebuild and I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drained camera pictures from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall\nHere and now today at noon on an H.

A. M. U. dot org Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while\nThere are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress his Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black\nHouse member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nAbsolutely trading him party to party from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's\nRetiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester all from the start for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town the where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nI'm Betty Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time lived the states uh enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he of ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much\nKeeping to well within the norms of their party Eddie Edwards has\nYou know embrace Donald Trump the every Giuliani appear campaigning with him\nUm and he's in some ways tried to cash Kris ... says you know part of some sort of resistance movement does this thing we've got a sushi nationally uh you know Chris Pappas is hardly a radical guy or you know family I'm Ron restaurant ah worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nAnd uh this race though is one where the seat can go either way and ah both parties believe they have a shot was\nAlso a gubernatorial race underway here the Republican government governor Christian new new faces Democrat Molly Kelly she is one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from community minded Fenton family dealerships serving keen swans Ian olive Chester county giving back to the community for over Thirty years ... dealerships dot com rented\nState candy shop and they discussed paid family leave I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ... brands listen listen\nIt's going to help families here and how it's going to help people the more productive at work and sell\nIt can lean ran everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is for people to be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work\nHard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they loved that loud when they're needing to know\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator ... brand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue [noise] um it's a challenge to somebody covering the first how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue\nHe was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it at the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\nUm you know the Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Raleigh Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work their way through college and that\nYou know ... new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh you know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy\nUh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race\nWell I'm ... you know Sunni should win you know we have to your terms here no governor has been talks after one term\nUh since two thousand four and part of that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nUh here polling indicates new news up by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and Molly has outrageous person in his three to one and the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch to this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only got he's got a four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand you know interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but\nThis is a race Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that ... uh buy dinner background but in being a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't is I Wonder what your senses of senator Jill brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is their speculation about her future maybe in twenty twenty there's a lot of speculation about her\nUm I think how much is it kinda resonate is is the big question I mean obviously there's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed around is one of the people that that people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move or that she makes\nOn is being picked apart um you know analyzed a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact it could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because of the Treasury Department revealed this week but the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred and sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade\nTo ... a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNo Alexandra some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly the tax bill\nPart of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest with more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an ... fan is Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out though at this rate although the economy is booming there's ... there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point\nOn it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform um to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill I'm\nThat obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on a welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kinda thing\nAnd and so going forward you know it's interesting they care to see Republicans silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits\nBut it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again is welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad you mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's going on with\nW E s Nashua eighty eight point three\nW.

our moral authority\nSonia wrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that ... was murdered based on recordings hurt by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in them Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior themselves\nWhat exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party before I let you respond to that ... tweeted and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens to us\nHe's not interested in the euro would you respond to that\nYeah absolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states in world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children and is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen\nHow can we say that weren't uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions and many other things\nI Will say though I James I do\nKind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because we've talked about this on this program before\nThe U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship but we've never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is an entangled\nBut I kind of take Sony has point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it\nWell this is the let me ... me amplified that point Josh represents absolutely critical you know someone who's been actually very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in them of paraphrasing here\nBut all the money in the world and all of US military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights\nIf we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalist for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms were broken here but that's a critical one I mean the show is called ... for the first amendment ... in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world\nAnd if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally of NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free range chicken\nRate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right I think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we'd never a threatened to sanction them over a there as you over their funding of ... and other extremists in Syria and we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country\nOr any country in the region for their actions except for Iran who has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with this then we may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out to show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S is actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits that data to show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or drop what can I comment on that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot sweep to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence that the Turks now have\nThey have the photograph these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve but which are part of the ... the crown prince of security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that may be there to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral ... theory as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to ... you know offer up a a senior scapegoat but I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened here\nWhat we will keep an eye on this story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given of course\nBut there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war continues to rage Seventeen years after it began with no clear end in sight\nYesterday the Taliban killed at leading police chief in Kandahar\nThe commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped unharmed today the Afghan government announced it's delaying elections in that province they were supposed to take place tomorrow those elections will carry on his plan and the rest of Afghanistan despite widespread violence the Taliban have already killed at least\nAnd democracy helps us dive deep into politics that affects the fine thank you to everyone who contributed to this campaign including carpet capital for more information is it an HP our innovation\nDot org support for NPR comes from this station and from ... am committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day and nine hundred franchise locations matinees IOM dot com slash NPR\nFrom logged me in makers have go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with features to help people stay focused to get work done and learn more it goes to meeting dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station\nBut now it's the friday news roundup with James kid field of the center for the study of the presidency in Congress in the ... of the Boston Globe and the Pulitzer center and have brown of buzzfeed do still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from around the world one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy at our neighbors to the north\nRight out guy now and I got out\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalized recreational marijuana\nNationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so why was the first in twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd with like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just made it official\nHays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time\nYou know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that\nWhen you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThan at or do you compare that to things like the way and offer the drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization if I'm\nYour words you bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have been nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which it it is doing now compared to you know being a private business\nUh that private but illegal business among many small dealers or it depends on how it affects the global drug trade and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift in you know I'm sure that Ken is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether causes surgeon traffic accidents where the cost of ... or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers on driving stone it is of course worth noting\nThat in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there with heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use\nAnd high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd oh and who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all and see the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's Todd oh one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things tax them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point out but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential\nMarijuana mess right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also dreams what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move or a negative moved there remains the question as to what legalization at a national level might meet for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate the point of being syllable and there are long lines around the block\nAnd things are running out supplies running out\nI Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for a\nWhile you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a an uncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find that a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not that surprise when you can walk into the main\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from community minded Fenton family dealerships serving king swans Ian olive Chester county giving back to the community for over Thirty years ... dealerships dot com\nAnd they use has happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see it as part of a continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north for probably going to get a jump on this on this\nBut um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYeah this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like to fly to love against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like\nIts issue about liberty and of course it help spur the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense to you know that this is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and and Canada Cain has had medical marijuana says two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a limb by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week M. J. Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault\nAnd harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that but any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start\nWith the story involving energy Akbar Hays how have we seen the me too movement play out\nIn India or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago\nAnd for a while uh I Know that our reporters at least we're watching Indian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where are we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks it has finally like grab the country and shaking it\nUh we've seen as all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and ... by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is try to bring these men into account\nAnd um it's it's really interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism seeing ... and\nUh the most of the women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they uh the the women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to the protests of the ... temple in Carol estate the BBC's dreams Clinton was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no no yeah the media and it turns out of making this they ... they don't really\nWant to do this goes up underneath religion that's the only thing the the\nEstate outside the ... temple there in ... I Wonder what your sense is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there's this external pressure from the media and politicians they wants to destroy our culture they want to destroy our religion he says", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Keene", "day": "19"}
