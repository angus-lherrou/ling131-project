so we know on this side of freedom\nA third of all the people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know that we're more people for marijuana than all violent crimes combined we know so much about ... freedom and we have a lot of work to do\nThat I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what did it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy in the plane\nBecause I Know that when I think about what freedom is at its core it's not only the essence of oppression but the presence of justice enjoy that we can get rid of all the bad things and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come and debate here we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the other side of freedom came from and then the case for hope is that I think the hope is the fuel for all of this to help his belief that are tomorrow's can be better than that today that when people say the system is broken and in in response some people say oh no it was designed to be like this my takeaway is that it was designed and because people made it up we can make something better and that is the work of hope\nThere are a lot of questions that our listeners wanted to put to you about the work that you're doing about the black lives matter movement and so on I definitely want to ask you about today's political scene but before we dive into\nAll

to dream accustomed to host of the podcast pod save the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny I don't take him myself is very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because it was urging everyday like every single day I had to show up as I taught sixth grade math everything they had to show up in our math to my students I had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Ninety a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lotta math or anybody who's ever been around eleven year old\nUh what I learned there were a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are can be consumed and can be repeated back so my skill was like what I learned was not only how to get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know when you didn't touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own\nOr the second was like really understanding what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggled like they can get in like anything lower than zero that like I don't get it by the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was like understanding like the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is I think the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there and then like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worse teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know them and I believe they might not know how to use them and what I can do is help them find them and use them long after we're gone\nLet's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nYeah so when we think about the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that uh you know for those of us who were industry in for a gift and we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to\nUs all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nUh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the street for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend what's unfortunate is that there's this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs it I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work who for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protests\nAre so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nOne of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people helps his sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people to you that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like what a catalyst for the protests there's just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concern about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the the way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end of ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N double ACP legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book specifically\nBut in general the space like I'm mindful of this ... when we started camping zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is\nNot a lot of money in the grand scheme of non profits and we did it so that we could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first I was a database of police union contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not paid I don't know salary from the stuff so we try to do it as like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit\nAh in with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to\nRely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well ah\nAnd you know it's like I ... at the way\nSustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I Do have you know it's like a [laughter] now late at night and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nAnd only this only a couple of months ago was the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been saying in the basement of a like my second parents for the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their second parents that's not sustainable so\nSo but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives and like oh I made it gets ill in dollars and and it's like well no you like see me on the news you hear in a pod cast you like to see me out of an event that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before and you know that there was any income and wealth is pretty significant right oh I'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another tax club or who wrote\nAs time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous\nWhat do you think he I think you know I think for ...\nFor two thousand years we slit people's arresting call their health care we literally dream people's blood down and we were like where it's going to drain out all the impurities and people were like oh ... their blood pressure they change it's like no they didn't have any blood writing like that actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nIn Manchester on to this day October with delicious food entertainment and

of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book like page and a half\nWere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote\nTalk about how those kinds of traumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward active as\nYou know it's interesting uh this is the first time I'm saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk and I just have it like having them with right back yet so hopefully I write back soon\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the chapters I can remember and now with that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a a\nCore part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy\nIs that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities when his poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of it and they they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass home and not to ask where I knew like when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up\nAnd sometimes we still only see a world of constraints semi the constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can start to manage and things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you didn't know that they were seeing the right and the left is it the right has always ...\nWe're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling no stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good story to tell her about a future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you enter the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times that are rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons are important for me to be out and very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very sort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay to think that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room and the gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected with them and social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about my own identity now I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know um [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt with free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed\nTo say that this happened and it was real and it was awful and you know when I told when I when I finally told a couple of years later they realized that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me I'm\nSo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important um but I had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that I had to learn what it meant to\nBe in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were periods and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to them\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my own air career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian or gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like there's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception\nDo you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay do you know let's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my identity than they have to be\nI think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up as gay that like there's not one way right that there is not to waste to be a ... and like\nWhy the pride parade is really really well\nJust like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there definitely people who are frustrated me who feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like\nYou know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life too I live in like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now they're trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that it's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that\nThat they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cause and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite worker on that but like I don't feel like I Need to talk about the every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right um\nSo the other thing I'll say that there's some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your heat\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders\nYou write that because of your willingness to engage quote there were calls from within the protests community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling me a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics\nHosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism word that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nNo it's like a both and drink that like you know what's interesting is that all those people who who come in for for quote participating in the system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in that Washington Post and people literally they were like you're wasting your employment I Can't believe you did that\nLike president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show

season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner and so there's a ... actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say ah when that line came up at the table read it got a much bigger laugh when I was expecting from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press tour about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be on a press tour talking about a ... a little bit\nIt's it's strange and you know one of the things we wanted to talk about when it putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the our tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so\nUm and it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius\nWho you know a touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just you know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain\nUm ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room

and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nFor him it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny um but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously\nUm you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's talking octopus or you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter]\nThis is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it is is retelling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television who do you see is your phone [laughter]\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah where do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show [laughter]\nNo I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American audience well I I think\nYou know obviously the the giants as The Simpsons and I would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know when one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson [noise] um\nBut also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I I said we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening it's going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really take things seriously in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak and he said they are credible princess Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat uh Internet a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm\nThem as one of the first people we cast [laughter] at the news cast her whale as a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a guy or a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda Lamont and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role [laughter] really and we call them it was like yeah sounds like fun\nUm and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season and you know what am I\nKnow fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some we'll noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought of is a very serious man uh goofing around going\n[noise] you know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think [laughter] well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal\nNow you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American is\nIn the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip to the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we've been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because\nAnother show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't believe it on our show any more um and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing and she's going to a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more ah as I was looking around at the cast and and thinking about\nYou know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our cast was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were passing these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is my I Need to start paying better attention to\n'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices or tried to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically\nUm you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles and I was not a as aware\nOf that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character\nAnd you know as I said in these other interviews um I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it's not like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it\nThen you know maybe this won't become an issue where this you know won't become the thing that I end up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up you know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult in our show because in some ways race doesn't matter\nBecause there is also talking ... you know anti eaters and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how has an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but\nThat debate next time around here and now the\nNext time is at twelve noon coming up right here in New Hampshire Public radio

decidedly low tech job but some productions refused to do without\nJoining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest and welcome to one a\nThanks for having me Joshua thanks for it was great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer or major writing and moved to New York and to you know my brother was working at CERN elaborate timers receptionist\nAnd ah they knew that you guys so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and ah\nDoor and to make writing connections and uh you know I did I did make some writing connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept on doing the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly and ah you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lot of shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one specially on Saturday Night live\nThe live aspect of it and being out there\nYou know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera a and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that the you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done lived before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all the stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know everyone was a pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live um\nThe Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the Project Runway that shoot and then we do to show any show that comes to that down these few cards you know work on that as well\nWhat kinds of people do well at this line of work\nThe first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school track years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of\nPrinting I as a cue cards I've seen her all written in all\nCaps yes correct It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the street and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train them for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn\nUm two or three weeks of leaning yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interviews ... these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these\nNew things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than it during whereas where how to end the card a confidante on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows the next car just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out\nHow to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight like near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glass as well your glasses on the show where you are contacts are we're not we're either\nI don't really like contacts hourglasses\nOkay so you're wearing a glass of so you can see fine I Want to have to if you didn't wear glasses and you didn't want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you can see but that would also make less words in the card and it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear your glasses you'll be fine\nJust you know we were we were to have her son's ride would practice with you if you've never read cue cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because it'll that look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean it looked as regularly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader and I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that\nYou would want to play to those cue cards now if you are looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later the audience would be like oh he's we obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we open depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right it's especially was Saturday Night live\nThat's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there was one set of cards\nWorking with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put the cards and I work with the director the stage managers wild well kind of confirmed and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical workweek SNL look like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously until eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsal is on Thursday and Thursdays a light day so the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day\nAnd then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only ... one one set of each sketch because\nI have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more and it\nIt'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely rewritten from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process we print but then on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it ... the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean that we do that we don't have the we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because Saturday show day\nSo everything's printed I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fun job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you ... you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working\nThere is a little bit of both um mostly um\nPeople that are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do it great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced and the people that want they\nThen in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related but yeah you sit those long days or friday but that leads to Saturday where ever heard that they may come out from behind the scenes and there are some with me 'cause I Can't I Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cards at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Keene", "day": "11"}
