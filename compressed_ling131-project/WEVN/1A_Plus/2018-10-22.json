A. M. U. dot org glad to hear from some of you across the state of Florida\nAbout what you're looking for from the next governor\nLarry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle they may be the rent is to parts of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our state\nLarry that is a such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael er we had Ninety percent of our power knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week uh we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy return to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch or our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nUp to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not that that politically that that is a community that will be for me\nUm is of no consequence there Floridians and there were a part of a of our state day is often been\nForgotten whether forgotten coast would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with him to help to define an economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of the state of Florida before\nWe add one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels as climate change progress is\nAnd it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures\nOf homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing in the home that weren't we're we're we're tooth picks basic that's right that Governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point\nHas to tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYou know it's it's such a fair point an and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and lie to the fact that we're seeing stronger\nI'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if they are then if you tell people where they can't lift that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean\nWhat less than right now we have the insurer a last resort in this state having to cover homes I'm Better nice and luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk\nFor having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real statewide conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise in climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for properties to be built\nAnd to be built and frankly in an and resilient way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with these increased storm events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be happening to begin this conversation I think is going to be a state wide conversation and it's one that we're going to have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor on defenses to take part in this discussion or a feature discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly love to have him on the program\nWhich I had one more voice to the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is Luis Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it and mayor Jen thank you are or appreciate the opportunity I Do want to note that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in the W well around listening area including Palm Beach Florida in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing parties in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Luis good to hear your voice again uh um it to 'em and well aware and thankful for your reminder of the early voting we actually had some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI'm I mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together they help or get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money\nAnd modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update 'em and I will tell you I'm I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy oh a Oliva\nI'm here and I spent some time together for two years ah making our way through\n'em in Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that to mean that I'm going to convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we begin from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing or maybe on dealing\nThat makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars for health care which is but the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions were governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party\nWith the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so there there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me and trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't you know squabbles they want to make sure that we\nCan produce and and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you know been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville\nUh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you may criminal justice reform one of the critical points have your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with the law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nYeah I mean so first I mean it shape it shaped it a lot I think if if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked to a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in her face when ah you know the the ... come by the house and say you know your son's in trouble again right um that that's a difficult thing for any child to have to see and experience\nAnd I remember deciding at a very early age that I never wanted to see that expression on my mom's face because of something that I did um and so I Am the first of my seven siblings to graduate from high school and as the fifth of seven kids in the first to graduate from college when my brother got home after doing his time\nI watched him want to be a better father for his daughter and a better partner or to his girlfriend and then to his wife [noise]\nVoters I like his message I like his background I think my first time they just turned Eighteen in may so we're going to be familiar with all the candidates for more than four however\nYou make sure you're following the news you need to make an informed decision and everything they tuned to NPR for all our

conversation with Louis Hernandez of double you all are in public radio in Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum Louis I Know our time is short but let me let you get another question for the mayor\nNo definitely a mayor I did want to ask you about the issue of race because it's been a pervasive throughout this campaign uh but you already know this Florida is one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent\nHispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting with black and brown voters to get them galvanized to take part in this midterm election\nYeah I mean I think we are doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate across frankly all communities um I've been in red areas blue areas purple area I was in ... I think Trump one button thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted an event\nUm um buddy quest forget them I'm a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... baby ... uh which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us\nIs that in a primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand bow to turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time\nVoted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand or the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins\nIs the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there will go in because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Gil in so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps they'll have a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... two questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation miracle\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground as it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine which allows for individuals to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders um onto their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be cleared the difference between what you're talking about just by way of context the castle doctrine you're referring to basically is that kind of your home is your castle idea that says you have the right\nTo use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened in any where you have a legal right to be just\nAnywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already protect you and your home there's already common law self defense which means\nAnd places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there is already case law on the books where you've been able when you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that to a different ditched dream and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and to help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children\nI'm In black and brown children feel particularly I'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin and the trace of Martin the case of marquee smug locked in\nA and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies because they both had weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover for for legitimate illegal practices\nI think about it because folks are able to ... stand your ground as a ...\nPoint before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say ...\nSo I Would say one yes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these radical atlas to buy the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refuse to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou can't you guys in parts for our kids play and our and our families picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about an affront to the second amendment was simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school\nHow do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got her it was some decency here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nAndrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate you making some extra

involving the public sector workforce like teachers\nFirefighters and government employees they make up one of the most heavily unionized sectors of America's workforce\nBack in June the Supreme Court passed a ruling that could make it harder for unions to secure labor contracts through a process known as collective bargaining the ruling affects more than twenty states and the consensus is it the decision will hurt unions financially and could lead to a further decline in membership\nAhead of that ruling some blue states took steps to protect organized labor what impact will all of this have on the labor movement and what impact does it having on election season\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberger executive editor of state line a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to what ... thanks very much for having we also welcome your questions and thoughts about what's happening in your state\nWith regard to unions we would love to hear from you whether you are a union worker organizer whether you are an employer whether you're in the private sector of public sector\nShare what you know about how your state lawmakers are dealing with unions\nEmail us one a at W. A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page or tweet us at one ... Scott let's get some definitions out of the way\nFirst of all when we say collective bargaining what are we referring to\n[noise] uh when we say collective bargaining or what we're talking about our negotiations between uh employers and a group of employees are on salaries benefits working conditions and the like and typically employees are represented by unions\nKind of basic wages and working conditions exactly now a number of states have a right to work laws on the books that are called right to work states what exactly do we mean by right to work\nSo a right to works a states and there are about I think twenty seven twenty eight of them now uh they prohibit labor unions and employers from requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of employment\nUh and of course a union dues are extremely important because that enables the unions to not only um conduct the negotiations during collective bargaining but also a to engage in other activities including a political activities\nSo if you are at a job at a a union covered workplace typical you know what I mean in a non right to work state\nYou get that job and you join the company and they say hey welcome to this job were covered by union here's your initiation fee you need to pay in a right to work state you can get the job and say no thanks I'm not eager to pay for this but I look forward to starting work that's right\nHow does union membership look in the U.S right now are we talking mostly about public sector workers like teachers more private sector workers like hotel workers some of whom are on strike right now what's the overall picture\nAll things considered we day on the news from four to six here on an age PR turning partly cloudy this afternoon high temperatures today in the forties it'll cloud up tonight overnight lows loaded mid thirties\nCloudy for tomorrow some afternoon showers with high temperatures from mid forties to around fifty\nDegrees this is an H PR [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from visiting angels professional caregivers assisting adults in bathing dressing meals and light housework nationwide visiting angels America's Choice and senior home care office locations are visiting angels dot com\nFrom constant contact who segmentation feature allows small businesses to deliver personalized email campaigns to connect with their customers learn more at constant contact dot com and from the any each case the foundation\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson this summer the Supreme Court ruled that public sector employees have a First Amendment right not to pay union for collective bargaining unions called as unfair because non union workers benefit from the contracts that can reach through collective bargaining but now won't have to pay for that\nSome blue states saw this decision coming in preemptively pass legislation to protect unions from high court's ruling were discussing that and more issues related to state laws on unions with Scott Greenberg executive editor of state lines Sarah Duncan is still with us on the line she's a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates and she has a K. through eight visual arts teacher\nWe love to hear from you about what your state is doing with regards to unions and right to work laws and rules comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\n... there was one more thing I did want to ask you before we had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners\nAbout their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that union negotiated for us on a road halfway\nSalary health insurance all that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent it higher level Caesar accountability that will ultimately lead to higher\nWithin the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers would Q. ten year that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts that were unable to continue to drive competition and the teacher marketer and ultimately compare ourselves through other business areas where\nCompetition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that first off\nI've not always been happy with everything that mining and has done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers the union is not just your union leaders eating and ends are driven by numbers and lenders need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do\nAlso I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices and it's actually not that difficult to fire a teacher but what unions has done is made it clear that\nYou can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and part of the reason that so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go Sarah I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates and trying to work with the other delegates about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think the residents of your state\nOr really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike\nTo make things happen in West Virginia\n[noise] I think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did with out is supportive our communities and I think that our community is realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just about pay or just about health care it's not about that\nNot just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general um I have seen with my own eyes legislators repeatedly putting the interests of outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of building it's also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate Jamaican time forest thanks very much thank you\nWhat's that a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fear or equitable enough\nUnions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers Scott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland comment about non union members\nGoing it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union correct me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions\nThe basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um [noise] uh uh differences that you were talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question too I think is an expert on down the ... and she's joining us and when I see in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to one day hey\nJoshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in very upscale district and I hope she makes that one of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to a little bit more about that in a moment I should also union contract I actually I don't usually contract so I said also introduce Vincent ... he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\nHey thank you for having me on principle if she's me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save these or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now the ceiling it depends on what the clause is about ... flu city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's good ... a context just for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage make very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the Janice case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions anything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor at not sell like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those are the public sector\nHave seniority built in are the only way to get a raise is by logging it other than your other job hey I'm andme all the way to go ahead and finish off\nUm so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice that allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves and negotiate a better contract if they can\nIf union worker if unionized workers don't pay unions to negotiate for them how can that not have an impact I mean you have to pay the staff that negotiates where you're writing\nVincent [noise] uh the problem is that they are forced to accept that representation whether they want it or not I don't know I hear\nTo the girl who had taken lead actually just the tip of the ... that there are thousands of down in

A. M. user station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want is their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write a singer wills to donate their cars to be you know cashed out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks and right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you don't have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know they're what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Joshua it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided that you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used today this that if you are\nAnd I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone then it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices\nThat get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention\nAnd that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to 'em or or bar association fees or student loan fee or student organization fees that when you have an obligation to serve all\nThat all pay a fair share\nAnd that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case about forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it\nWill be the case the gym is overturned\nExactly so but look Janice that Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court\nHas wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was idiot logically base because\nThe issue was really on the outside that that\nThe the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it that the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to a defined\nUs however the cases done\nAnd what has happened since is that members\nHave stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was\nOr Scott which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center actually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide taste sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states if we if we if we had done that\nPeople would be flapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nAnd let me give a giants and the chance to respond to them that will keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus Ashby case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay my say dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz um in some cases in credibly confusing time periods\nOr in some cases only about a week also that\nUm states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time\nForbidding anybody else from talking to that our employees and this is during the work day we clerk clerk or what you mean by a captive audience meanings what what exactly are you referring to\n[noise] um well recent legislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with ah with new employees so basically think a time share presentation on steroids where the union can come and\nSay this is why you have to join put a dues check off for a more a membership form in front of them say you have to you know here's why you really should sign up\nAnd there was no one else saying well wait a minute you know you actually have the right not to so that's why you're seeing all\nCountry saying no to know your rights and by the way if there is a artificial time period to limit when you can exercise your rights I'm this is what it is and here is help navigating that often confusing process and that process that may confusing on purpose to keep public employees trapped", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "22"}
