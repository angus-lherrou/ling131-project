A. M. U. dot org before we move on from the weather and climate Louis there was one more thing you want us to ...\nYeah I just wanted to lead to mention you know ... the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to a tax a on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate an economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure it sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I. T. I. P. C. C. set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really telephone is very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political will not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada same thing there yeah prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to\nImpose it a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment a few more comments on this not my autonomy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change\nA good point not my kind of me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not questioning the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLeery tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck\nThis storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida but as he sees all risk of living within yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there\nYou just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the town to don't incorporate uh it's it's it's a tough one [noise] nobody's really tough and when we're we're we're we're\nOf thirty to forty year are taught and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em their existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience but whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take her that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... one small point just to and if you think that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they start to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us one a at W.

Shane Harris and Todd's will still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts on the week's top stories won a ass W. A. M. U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them\nSeem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go\nIt seems to have had office it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say\nThat the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who's challenging a Republican and a red state\nActually had a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee uh maybe picking up an open seat to now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nBut what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath\nIn front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January\nThey will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have championships in like ... and like a shame said before they will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond\nI'll statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile highly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee\nOr the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on nests face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in that says supplemental background check will click also and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up so she's up for reelection\nEven that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say it she just last night with trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that they're trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California ... this is a court that's been a real ... side the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on that and she's very upset about that and Trump\nAt times to administration is really breaking French tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these packs\nI Do want to see if we can leave time it's all California politics before the round up is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president stepping in the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just missed swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee but he woke up Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're going to have lunch you were going to do you want to say I don't want to put you in this guy let me do this [noise]\nI Love this guy right there is really\nNo county West was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear of those Shane Harris Conyers seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I I see it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... are more important stories I hesitate to do these deep and it's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is just really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it\nBut it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre carnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nFor president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching has had about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment and I know for for for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nThe Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British in has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically sent hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth\nWhat do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened right well what we know right\nNow is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies are what we reported last night my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was at the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove Fletcher mark ... who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten and tortured killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility um the Americans and we understand have not seen the footage or heard it themselves but there's a growing believe within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress and the White House ah that the Saudis probably did kill Jamal ... and are not at all being forthcoming about that this is a politically\nW ... or ... point three W.

A. M. U. dot org let's get back to that story of the Saudi Arabian journalist ... who has gone missing possibly murdered\nJohn ... we've heard a number of accounts particularly from the Turks about what Saudi Arabia allegedly did to Mr to show you that they basically said hitman after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point\nFor shall we know that ... to into the come so uh in Istanbul\nAnd he didn't work out that is what we know for sure there are reports that they were to go string jets that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men have ... they go into\nA blackout of vans a drive to the ... so the ... so generals residents which is allegedly ... show he may have been taken and they did what they did to him now there are reports circulating that a Turkish intelligence have proof\nOr that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered and a ... ... the most brutal brutal debts\nTo a Saudi Arabia on the Gulf Stream jets a little later in the day now we know that the the planes that were those to play movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to ...\nWho was on them ... that designation was within the state type of racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the ... the Turkish are telling the authorities here\nA ... you will thirties here in the U.S to understand is not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that that has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded I Know what the implications might be there's some things that you can easily sweep under the carpet in international affairs on there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... quit I miss definitely falls into that category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship the real long time allies and the press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to she'll use disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're looking again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nBecause she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or for a permanent resident okay we're all like John ... widow like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four\nOr five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday and when we was referring to the human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms the hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia Corey I Wonder if you could give us your sense of how this case\nFits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I read earlier a re read it chest sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nAnd there is no reason to maintain close ties with the country that the heads more people than ISIS finally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing is killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of the quote unquote royal\nFamily if I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared Kushner would be banned from any policy making\nLaw the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you could help us fact\nChecked that yeah I think um it's it's really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy and\nThat attitude had activated a lot of um people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have an argument for a long time just as the commentator said I'm\nNow we're supporting the war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nThe hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporter this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's\nEarly reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval\nSo no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns of alive I think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people are grandpa are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that the u._s. trumping ministry and have to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I wanted there is a counterpoint to this too which is that\nRelationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of set the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because we have never had a relationship an alliance based on value since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat then lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we've always seen them as a strategic ally not as the values faith allies in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump said it in a particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have but this is somewhat reflective\nOf what you at the uh presidents have said quietly for a long time\nYeah sure sure if I could chip in the ... here I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime ministers have said it could moments in relationships you have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge I'm Still that was about to be concluded and the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into Saudi Arabia or had been doing and whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nUm old ... and you know it was clear that the Saudis who said to Blair you've got to call this the core off the dos otherwise the deal is in jeopardy\nAnd highly unusually mercifully controversial Leigh Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was too big a customer\nToo important an ally and you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first places he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether they're regrets email note is an open question however they they are they're on the un Donald Trump is determined that the arms deal will go ahead\nJosh before we keep ... go ahead and oh I was just going to\nSay if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the peace down as you recall last month at the un and the United states is pretty aggressive in Cali around the biggest threat to the region and by extension it was\nSeen Saudi Arabia is that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion\nAcross the middle east on and of course Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of peace deal so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\nPolicies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S focus on Iran and stopping in Iranian expansion on shape it's reaction or lack there of 'em to chew what's happened in Saudi Arabia and if it is and in fact is the case that they have\nAnd each PR campaign for innovation had helped make possible exciting new content for and about New Hampshire like outside

A. M. U. dot org\nThe story of the next president of Interpol Ming hung way who's reported missing last week by his wife that stories moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest is part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping know grace Meng the ex Interpol president's wife\nIs speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened nets use if do we have a sense that you know\nOf why this is going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government or what this means a larger sense\nWell he's been a long time\nRole and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with ... our democracy is at risk John ... what's projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... NATO could win this\nFor the last poll I saw suggested yes the the the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent on the opposition leader is at forty two percent or ... for them to her dad and so I kind of thing that you'd have to say that it's it was sort of margin of error is going to take some quite something for the left is kind of the kinds of it\nTo come back from that position um I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about both ... he was stabbed\nIn September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence around but it has meant that he's been able to say I really love to take part in debates really count at the moment because I'm Still\nYou know slightly getting ready for this stopping that I had been so I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is\nHe's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they said that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people we talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people will vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Mitt to use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country can say it's not a big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact and send it needs to be dealt with aggressively in of course the kinds of changes that this report says need to happen are so I'm\nDrastic that in demand sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so\nI'm ... years scene of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants of impact that nations are already seen and you know as a as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of wars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat sell on\nE. it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment that really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly at it in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says it needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nI was in Europe at the beginning of the week and when the report came out and I on the main national news shows of half an hour long so the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes with devoted to the side PCC report\nI Wonder how much was devoted I mean there's one of the things that really strikes me about living here ... in America where you get more whether I think the square inch\nA new huge amount about whether the climate is not discussed and that is one of the things that really strikes me whereas I think there's a much greater consciousness whether they're doing that much about it is another issue but I think that you know I Am struck by how a lift all this ... the national debate a competitor in other parts", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "12"}
