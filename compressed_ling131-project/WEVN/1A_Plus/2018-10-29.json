I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like down and get us off the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as maimed up to be First Amendment the first amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes curtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of\nSpeed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome folks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak to such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise] I also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's\nAnger but we've seen nothing like the white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae ... people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported nimble than from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody on the last two is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least\nAnti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign out before the election in which\nHe highlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states of course trap the taps into\nVery old anti Semitic tropes ...\nYet but it was a a I'm Sorry where am I going to do you wanna get a little deeper into that a lot of folks a lot of our listeners have been chime in on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president\nDid address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism and every other forms of\nEvil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news\nThe fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the opened an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote gotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan as in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes\nI look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers that his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira I'd well\nWe're going to be familiar with all the candidates for more than four\nHowever you are what make sure

Jacobs Charlie wars and in the ... let's get some more of your questions and comments Constance in Silver Spring Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre\nIt was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump telling it like it is he could be as prejudiced and rude as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAG W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with her own words are votes and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful divisive speech that is anti American journalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant rents if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with

this year in the wake of the meats you in times of movements Tennessee Vermont in Washington state among others passed laws banning certain kinds of confidentiality agreements other states including Maryland and California passed laws that expands sexual harassment protections to workers like freelancers\nIt's another example of states taking action while Congress makes promises and remains deadlocked\nToday we'll discuss these new state laws and what impact they could have workers and employees it's the final part of our special series state where in where we've been focusing on the bills and initiatives that are trending in state capitals\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law

the employment labor in retirement program at the national conference of state legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us yes thanks for having\nWe'd also love to make time for you particularly if you've had experience with sexual harassment sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not protect you if the law did not protect you in your state what went wrong or perhaps what did the laws in your state do write\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't recover\nSo when you look at workplace sexual harassment laws um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees that if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment laws\nSuzanne hold seeing the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about\nWhich states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states I had introduced legislation as it relates to lending or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending forced arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York taffy California and he mentioned Vermont and Washington\nAnd other states are also looking at extending training requirements\nAnd so how many hours messed a employees are employers and require training and so we've seen legislation on that\nIn ... California is just one example of that\nTipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from the inner ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band\nShooter she says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to put that on my social media it can change your reputation I really wish I could to protect myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFrustrated with how common is this for freelancers and Nina situation\n[noise] I Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive\nTo provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I Love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University this year BU required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expending sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen this year and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that they've been new creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really effective\nWhat sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior so one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention to workplace harassment\nIs some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment\nWell when you think about me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of the system\nSo part of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace that it's relatively easy especially under federal law for employers to get out of them and a lot of states have really low caps on damages so if you through your employer the maximum amount of money that you can get from them\nThat and the day's news here are now coming up at noon

state laws the name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nWas Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth typically we welcome some more of your questions in thoughts as well especially\nIf the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or failed you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one way or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nEmily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... sounds like ... California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's ban a real leader in this case does with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session as well the ... that unfortunately we're vetoed by the gas\nThe statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim you know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon for other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws and meaningful way spending\nStates Emily that you're targeting in particular\n[noise] well I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a pass new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work\nThat would ah keep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nShe was on hold your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nI'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that I did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created\nA sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitations laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org sets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder if she's in if we can begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not inherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I worked in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information business wrote on our Facebook page\nThere was a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however you does a disservice to our communities one beer used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes so that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements\nAnd sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily band nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as it relates this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nPressure typical before we move on to too much for their kids\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think is at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here\nProblematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct has occurred or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line that case\nFor someone who stick with you for a minute I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or helpful or hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said\nThat they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions with federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contracts that you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that does can't cover a sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract that keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that\nSo the contracts in a way educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person is represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiffs lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's moved the path toward the settlement\nAnd the thing that's kind of hard about this is the people who maybe had the most interests and learning us information aren't at the table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say and whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nLet's get to some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier\nLuckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a word conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution\nDo laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\n[noise] well that's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond set our ally yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed in one state but the harassing or assaulting behavior was in another\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection and there are core federal protection they should be strengthened in various ways that their core federal protections against\nWorkplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is a baseline that covers everybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about\nBut no matter you know what's it called they live in\nA suit said I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes through arbitration\nState representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the rep said it would\nRight now we're considered one of the most ... states and the nation's one source I just looked up said we're number six\nSix out of fifty own worst states for litigation matter of fact if you divide or the country into five four regions the south has one
