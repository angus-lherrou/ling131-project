Corum when I was seven point one W E v J Jackson Ninety nine point five W ... co Brooke Ninety point three and W. E. B. Q. Littleton Ninety One point nine an on line at an H. P. R. dot org\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be\nHave some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers Congress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key boats here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not necessarily not not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this is going to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she's delivering her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor and in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact\nSo we're now going to hear in their entire already over the next few minutes from two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had the other senator we'll hear from\nIs the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first\nNominee Neil Gorsuch to confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes needed Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what she would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their side at but don't\nBe fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their point man\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days in Brockton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise] ah there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories\nSupport for any live stream comes from you our listeners and from castle in the clouds and borrow\nExperienced the beauty of autumn in New Hampshire from happen to capitalize on that state's what a trails or taking conference used my dining on the tennis open galley through October twenty first capital in the clouds dot org\nDays [noise] as well\nWe'll talk about that a little bit more a mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary the well was poisoned from the outset when President Trump's selected judge Kavanaugh from a list of names pre approved\nBy hard right special interest groups\nFor whom the national interest is a trifling concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care\nAnd achieving a partisan majority\nOn the Supreme Court\nThe rock worse and when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee\nShielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public\nJust guarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd forwarding norms of transparency and fairness and finally the dam broke under the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh committed a sexual assault in high school\nIn twenty Eighteen\nThe Republican majority conduct at a hearing\nThat made the Anita Hill hearings in Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side\nNo independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning\nThey even hired an outside counsel\nTo put a witness Dr Ford on trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus\nRepublicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nInvestigation which was then severely ... scribe by the White House\nOur Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth\nFirst they blame us for delay\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control of when nominees are brought to the floor\nLeader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago or one week ago Democrats had nothing no say and don't\nWhen it comes to who comes to the floor but in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward\nBecause he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats\nWhen it comes to complaining about delay\nTwo words never come from our Republican friends lips\nMerrick Garland\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction\nWith his nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward her conscience did\nOur Republican friends\nAre are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nOf what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they choosing Dr Ford of a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction\nBecause that is who they're actually blaming their decrying\nHer testimony\nAnd then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee\nFuture Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons\nFrom the Senate's conduct here\nLet them look back on this chapter\nHas the shameful culmination\nOf the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing\nTo entrench in advantage on our nation's court let the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue\nTo the brazen theft\nOf Justice Scalia's seat\nThe ignorant many aunts and\nA bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nFor whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh\nNow the stakes are always hard for U.S Supreme court nomination but college the extraordinary events original wage\nTime when we voted later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator strongly well qualified judge show our highest court\nNot any more about after all this the United States Senate will also be making a say\nWithin the states that partisan politics can override the presumption innocent or we'll read from that in the United states of America\nEveryone is innocent until proven guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob and ...\nAre valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate ...\nAll ... up and say that serious\nThoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy on American Pie\nOr will declare that our society cannot ... must not will not set the bar so low\nSo madam president today is a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here and the Senate as well the ideals that justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long or on ...\nSo let's step back and ... through the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people have been treated too during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\n... the last two weeks they're very nice judge cabin always announces the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare the nominees would pave the way they're tearing\nCrowds of far less protesters\nStill filling out in the blacks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey describe judge ... nomination has a great\nMoral struggle\nAnd which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against it\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii you argue that her personal disagreement with judge ... judicial philosophy met and I'll listen to this\nHe deserve less about presumption ... innocence ... came the allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagreed with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption ... innocence\nWhen it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member the Judiciary Committee that's the definition ... due process\n... due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we've solved the junior senator from Rhode Island and ... forth with great confidence great company\nOffering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightened\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings at play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh classmate set him straight earlier this week\nJust stop and consider the snap shots\nThe absurdity the absurdity the indebtedness ...\nThis is our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution\nTo public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about\nDelay obstruct and resist\nAnd before they get dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation ... hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nIt was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats or consider this nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nAnd so called resistance until the final vote was called\nFor a fair wage their average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for delay those fell flat there were broach destruction to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside about Jefferson\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice ... ... women\nHospital the vulnerable people\nHospital workers same old tricks same old playbook\nThey all players weren't working\nThe distortions were being liberated drowned out\nSenators received and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination than for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus\nOpinions\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts\nWas nothing like the character nothing like the character\nSo it was fair amount of president the old tactics weren't working\nWhat I'm going to get the job done the resistance demanded more\nTry something new they said well we all know what happened next\nOn corroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpened\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the community collected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's Seventy seven FBI\nInvestigation\nBy and embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence none no it\nWas produced a support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring\nNothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after all we sort of get it right now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they'd been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yeah again\nI Believe the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this\nBecause individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again\nThe latest story as it the whole investigation is invalid\nBecause individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third I Am\nAbout nearly forty year old allegations weren't\nTreated as a central witnesses never mind that they didn't actually witnessed anything they didn't want to say anything so let's be clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly in possession of here say\nThis bring that up and give a listen Maria and\nMr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that he voted to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators at their desk is very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people that are close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things Senate do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader he has made himself central\nOr to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cash that for the magic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare\nThis would be the combination for Mitch McConnell of all a lifetime really of campaigning for a change to federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as they go through the rules are killers\nMystery to me\nMr Udall\nMr Van Hollen\nMr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote ... Scott Detrow\nWe're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live to vote is in is is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm since the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has yet of Delaware went and checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for a cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said\nIt has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and it really is it in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the convention a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking a at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he ... the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevator screeners are paid professionals only looking at only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is a correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia when we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin and that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state this cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia He's under a lot of pressure to vote\nYes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you're going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nHe's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be a coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite final tally at this moment\nOn Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient Alex covenant\nHas been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nA Steve could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to get ...\nAnd some energy heading into them in terms of the midterms are barely a month away this is a big way in a big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been in and do jazz him gap has a lot of the service has shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have it when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparently gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters\nAs ... and that was a challenge for us going into the midterms it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are gonna be more amped up then the people that are kind of fat and happy\nBut now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats for Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism and Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to to succeed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for ... years yet\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you termed it for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee from\nA Republican perspective we wanted we wanted a ... a a another plenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there indefinitely while the character assassination continues and then yes I Do think part of it is the ... the political factor which is\nTo ... eighty eight point three
