A. M. U. dot org and we're taking your calls and voice mails at eight five five to three six one a one a speaking of calls let's get to one now from Florida David is on the line Hey David what's on your mind\nOr Joshua hall or good what did you think of your hearing so weak\nUh you just said the impact on the nation that's a ... exactly what I Would\nComment on I feel that uh I'm actually glad that the um\nThat the hearings were made a public because it allows us as a nation to weigh in on what exactly is going on in Washington with our politicians and how they're making decisions\nFor us or with regard to these things so uh I think it was very important that we all uh chime in on what's going on in regard less of a or political or aspirations uh I myself have a they also at the alcoholism\nIn my past ah I found a recovery in Nineteen eighty five I I understand the struggles of alcoholism but I also understood stand up uh in my youth when I struggled with alcohol as I grew into adulthood\nI uh was able to me I was able to hide or my drinking and to justify my drinking and this is a characteristic of alcoholics they\nAre very adamant about defending their drinking and also at the same time admitting that ah they do not have a problem so um\nI think it's very interesting for us to see um individuals or come to terms with their past and how it affects their future and how that affects the future of all of us\nDavid how ... how do you think there's ... ... how do you think this will affect the confirmation battle though I mean I hear you about these other conversations that need to be had in terms of whether or not Brett Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court or not what impact do you think the last few days might have\nA ... one particular clip I saw on CNN was when I'm One of the senators was questioning him about er an FBI investigation\nAnd he refused to answer he falls silent as he he he explained that he was hoping to what the committee or would a welcome however he personally would not comment\nOn whether or not he would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch his wife or her response to him because when he was\nNot answering that question should be staring at him very sternly and I always also wonder what exactly was she thinking when he refused to answer this question regarding an FBI investigations\nYeah you're you're actually yelled at your friend that question that's asked Senator Durbin of Illinois to have enough\nAnd there's nothing to hide we should be open to any possibilities\nYou know David I appreciate you Conan thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jump back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell the question or for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back and\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired and Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bring in our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court and administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices come from the political world they work for president of one party\nIn politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they\nTry to put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court and focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view influences their decisions to some extent but I think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh's confirmed\nHe is a successful just as well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas frankly a is today if you ask\nThe justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him so and so when you're ... came to Vanderbilt last year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think we'll get beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nLet's get another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drove the president of the constitutional accountability center of public interest law firm as think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth walk them great to be with you let me start with the question that I began with\nFor professors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimony as we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh but how that might affect the ultimate big decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller uh just uh your your um listener just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh I made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault and\nYou can choose that new hurts zones T. as I thank you that's we have some other thank you guess online that you can check out you also of course

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the alleged misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from a his testimony involving Dr Ford\nAnd his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about or emails involving lower court confirmations or should Ellen ... programs and the evidence suggests that he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that a small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho's your mom but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation I feel deeply sorry for Ford is she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it\nI also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence I should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mail messages about this for across the country\nAnd even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox\nThe Kavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press beat the suit ... side to side\nThe opinion though is uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court\nAnd its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body\nThe shock is not\nAt the partisan tones of the hearing the right left battles are left right battles happened here too\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues\nAnd the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address\nThe Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember our conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money hidden in offshore bank accounts to do which is I took was one of the major papers that helped drive that forward\nI Wonder a professor for Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means for just America's image around the world how the world is reflecting on us because of the way we're handling this\nWell after last presidential election I'm not sure image can get any worse um but uh you know I I think that it it is a shame that the judicial nomination process has become so broken part is and\nUm and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame if the Democrats what they did to Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia passed away was unconscionable in my view and I frankly don't blame the Democrats\nFor retaliated um with this nominee a and what's so uh I really think that in in order to make the system\nWill say daddy thanks to all of you for stepping up and saying an HP are is programming that you believe in and we're asking the rats have you been sitting back and\nUh it's on the list I'm going to get to it do it now get in for that I had gave away and H.

Scott Greenberger I Wonder if we can talk a little bit more about red flag laws and their impact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing four term governor of California\nJust vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag law Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back on Democrats get an array of ways so this is an unprecedented in terms of\nHuman vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um\nA a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm at the Jerry Brown has a governed as a a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise]\nUh you know in this case he felt like it at perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh\nIt went a little too too far um and a richer note it's a question of a balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um post a Parkland has focused on a these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers\nYou know the argument or the ... argument for for such a long time was that a guns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive or for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um uh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws\nAre they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are a very strongly support there a Second Amendment or what they view is their Second Amendment\nGun rights and and folks who would like a um some more ah controls and safeguards speaking\nMaryland who's Republican had an a minus reading from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in this February\nFive said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds\nThat's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation\nIn general this policy would allow family members for law enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order\nIssued by a judge which were prohibited individual\nFrom having any firearms or ammunition if the judge has clear evidence that the family member poses a an immediate and present danger\nUm uh causing injury to themselves or to others individuals with a mental illness should not have access to fire on there\nThat is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that his a minus rating from the n._r._a. dropped to ... feet as a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact do you think\nThat that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan\nActually there are a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact on his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating that Brady Gibson as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that had been taken which show in every state across this country\nA vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately uh the you know the second Amendment rights of of gun owners west or the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job\nIs getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not been shot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning thing the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions so I certainly applaud governor Hogan for doing the right thing here\nHe should definitely do it now because there's only about twenty minutes left\nBefore we draw for an eye patch which is really exciting but definitely exciting is that we're going to drop for you know other eye pad at six o'clock so the sooner you give us a call one eight eight eight eight zero five six four seven seven or the sooner you go online and H.

F. or TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think was burned out on was the fact that you have an Eighteen year old a who did purchase this weapon I think I think without that particular fact he probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what are you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being free will\nParticularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in them all so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military\nSociety has already said that you're trained in can carry a firearm so this bill would not unfair that even if those are just\nThat's the ... in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYeah stand are as challenging it in court I think a Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for the n._r._a. for a long time um had a suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe\nOf Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws at the minimum age being one all of which were a really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nHas long been one of the strongest a sort of incubator ... of the enterprise legislative agenda and I think is very telling on obviously the reactions of Parkland and that that activism that took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to safe storage in a moment but the ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city about guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which a state representative who joined us\nWith your fingerprints I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find that conversation online at our website the one a dot org before we move on to other kinds of gun legislation Richard Feldman could I just get your sense in terms of\nThe ... real view on gun legislation DNA has said that some measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level or we just kidding ourselves here should we just\nCome out and just see the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more\n... and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first let's define something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a.\nHarmon endowment number the n._r._a. there five million NRA members um there's the board of directors there's the senior leadership there that can psalms there are many and our race\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA edible show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride\nHas so many will myself included um\nBut I I I think we're talking about the senior leadership of NRA here and um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner\nOf if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate that ah when you turned Twenty one you're given a gun they're almost institutionally has to be against it because of the terminology and the political position of the terms gun control\nThey don't mean what we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times but\nYou know what I mean about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big ... Dana lash the main figures who speak with a national voice for the ... it's the you know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those\nAds with Dana last that say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... you know liberties last safe place that NRA that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics that's galvanizing the true believers that's about membership that's about fundraising\nThat's about or organizing for the next a political event both sides to it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues in America [noise]\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in the firearm debate than others although we've been put on that side Scott Y. disorder sides\nWanted to ah just ah to to add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned in perhaps a we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where\nState legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a [noise]\nUm the gun lobby is such that uh that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm a there is another outlet in many states and that's about an issue of Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Keene", "day": "01"}
