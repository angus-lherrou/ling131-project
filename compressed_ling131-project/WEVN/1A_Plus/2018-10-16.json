are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nI recently ... ... ... and I am an offering and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and\nTeaching about climate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are\nJust regular people who might not have the education that I had had that climate change because from where I'm standing in plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Paul I wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add or comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership leading the world\nThat's possible but when one party in the United states denies factual information over twenty year period than elects a president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters may reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate Katie emailed\nMy family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much\nHe will consider that just maybe there is a greater sing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation nurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe it and\nYou know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to that the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through and through relationship and trust and empathy on because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nAnd anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions ... into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing worldview and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the UN's climate change which we discuss last week on this program and not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit 'cause they're not going to be around to collect you know what I'm saying like\nIt just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWell I Want to so yeah I get it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit with the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at this science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that\nWe're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us and specifically in the U.S Native American and indigenous Native American people who have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at it\nThe the consequences from climate change if we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survive through massive massive shift we know these stories and we can inform our strengths and resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying\nThe earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and things vigilant I Would\nJust go go ahead go ahead ... but oh I Would just add that the St Louis is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions that there's a lot of good news here\nTwo years ago we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the golly agreement to phase out HFCs turns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon\nIf we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate\nWe can limit near term warming and prevent runaway climate change we need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually solve it\nTo exactly to combat that fake lives in which is a serious problem and I I really do feel empathy for people who are overwhelmed by an apologist to dig in sound a little further what our HFCs\nAgencies are hide your floor carbon or manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration in air conditioners and they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set of CFCs chlorofluorocarbons\nTo fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican so also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush\nAt

tomorrow's program about being Native American\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was a ... back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders say direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard it's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms\nIf you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah my ... and Paul blitz so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shut you down and drains you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess let's get back to Arlene's question on our website and ... and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem\nYou can do personally for climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there were a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but\nThere are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is here at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate\nChange and sort of role play how one might respond to those for example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would happen to years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean bad things are happening right now so [laughter] there's evidence that um that that those projections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of protections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentrations in we are able to do a very good job at projecting or the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nThing I guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there is cutting so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a\nCollapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate we we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and that the the climate for earth planet has been ... oscillation between glacial an inter glacial state abrupt warming ...\nFollowed by slow cooling into glacial states so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sun Sarah backup\nLearned along the changing geometric relationship between glacial and enter glacial stay last me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like like bring it on earth for me\nOkay so in the last million years the the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an ice on top of North American and you're Asian continent sea level is lower\nUm it's a colder climate on and then in injure glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift this on this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate\nAnd the heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat was paste by the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth pills as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure following you this yeah heartbeat this earth heartbeat between hold too warm Cold War it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest\nWhat it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that's exactly right at like ... okay that makes for a pattern that's been ... that's been happening for the last ... million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern I was saying we're on a super high cholesterol\nSugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control\nThat's a perfect that's a perfect them as that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit were on her way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we went with very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the U. S. public actually\nDenied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house process or your lecture at American University Center for environmental policy and a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you judge them and Sarah my re PHD research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ...

I think it could be if we don't realize the moments are the moments that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mueller gave that speech where out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area it was the\nFirst major speech on cyber as a national security threat I think about that it's now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major officials to be the top threat and it was only around ten years ago that we've been talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have a guest on later a number of former Justice Department person Monica vicar from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years running this treaty division exploit social media\nIn order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling case um that I talk about that still I think people haven't heard about ... of the case that looks from the perspective of a company\nLike someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks he also through bitcoin on the also on the back end had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen name due date Hussein he became friends with them only through Twitter only on line\nAnd what he did with that stolen customer information that was provided to him was turn it into the kill list\nThat said using this customer information are located from his safe hole and Rocca a Syria he bombarded back to the United states through social media a list of the stolen customer information and said kill these people by name by address where they live\nThat's the new era of national security that that we're in we're criminal threats merge or blend with terrorists and national security threats and companies the private sector is on the front lines for the first time\nMust show emailed as a person of a certain age I recall a world that function before\nThe digital age are total reliance on digital information is making us less safe were trading safety for convenience I Wonder John if Michelle has a point there used to be a time when you had to actually go to the bank to Rob it and now you don't\nShell definitely in fact one of the cases we talked about is an Internet a bank heist a where hackers managed to send human operatives to ATM machines all across the world in different countries and they used a hack\nTo simultaneously allow them to withdraw money from me eh from ...

files\nWe'll speak to the layman and share some of your stories tomorrow on one day we've been talking about the threat from cyber attacks and we know that some hackers are hell bent on stealing our secrets so now might be a good time to go check your Facebook account\nThe most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you law right in without having type your password every time\nIt gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at\nAnd personal details that you posted like your religion your home town your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI or trying to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress but his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day or so the first thing they become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through in its reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violate our policy so for instance terror propaganda now we remove the terror propaganda that we've removed from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags that for us\nNow once content has been flat as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nA and making a decision if it violates the policy and ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up\nThat's got to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area that person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have native language speakers because they really understand the way that language as he is\nSo that's a big focus in our hiring once you're hired as a controversy or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying\nAnd to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook and violates its terms\nWhat's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing that say a reviewer or a bus would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with it we\nStill rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side that said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well in a couple of areas where it's harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community send it to us or sees it at all\nUm in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing it now when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment\nA lot of that is very contextual for instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or\nAt our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch so it's really important for us to give tools to people\nSo that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns\nHow does that pattern recognition work\nWhat we do so most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves\nFor instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise pilot in our content policies we also have policies against terror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance want it to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's represent an al ... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through to our review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just have one comment directly sometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lie or copy and then there's other options and in those other options there is an option to report somebody I Wonder how\nMuch Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world does learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive\nI think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it and because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time to have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people house Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people will have different levels as experience and finding these reporting options and even just understanding how this works so we actually do the options that we offer\nThe by location and we're always testing ways to get more report to us to make it easier\nNow there's a tension here if you just have one big red button and people can present whenever they want them to things happen one is that people might report things when what they really mean it just to hide it and get the content away from them because they don't like that person and the other thing that happens is we don't have enough information about the post", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Keene", "day": "16"}
