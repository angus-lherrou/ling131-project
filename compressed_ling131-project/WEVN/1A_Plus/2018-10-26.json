A. M. U. dot org\nAdam or go see a before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet\nFrom Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already set beliefs how do we break out of this and show people that those you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter]\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civic discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and work perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence that doesn't happen in the United states given the depths\nOf these differences um I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believe to be important in life\nAnd what we want government to do\nWe had fundamental differences forever and what we believe that but I think\nThis increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making and then he was the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nKind of because I'm a report I talked to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and\nAnd Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter this\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics listened to I mean I understand the idea about the division but if you hate NPR so much how do you know what we said on one aid to criticize us if you ate the Washington Post so much\nHow do you know what was printed there to criticize it\nYeah and quite frankly I think that that a behavior is exemplified most from the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it\nUm and and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging that's who don't want us to do what it is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we are a meat criticism or the media needs to be criticized we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better\nWe're going to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of the story over the weekend you please just remember that the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions\nAbout what has happened there already been some details of the story that had been clarified or walk back so that is common in a fast moving breaking story like this\nKeeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org ...\nA few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue believe mess referring to the the congressional baseball game which Republican Congressman Steve ... of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to deceive law enforcement\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if this story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly much no but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump he was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks listen\n[noise]\nThat wants to do well frankly not care about our country so much [noise] you know what we can go and really we're not supposed to use that word I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nUsing Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term sheer what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nAnd neither is global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a nationalist it's just someone who put America First um but the reality as anyone with a as a historical context of nationalism knows that it is a world view embraced on other rising uh that has led to\nUm you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself a\nFrom a spaces that would give them rights that uh\nWe we deem a central and important to human beings um and so a Trump you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from the term national that's when we saw\nA Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because uh the ... the form of nationalism back what's most a familiar with ah banning and the bribe our community\nWe've seen um you know sweep Europe and even in hate groups in the states and so it's it's been it's been deemed by most people will be problematic to see Trump embrace it hum wild misrepresenting it or put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nAdam reduce the I'd love you to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is on the use of the word nationalist versus say patriots\nParticularly because words like nationalist often heard in in phrases like white nationalism global is has connotations of being anti Semitic give us parsed words parts of the language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his ... secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's\nFor him to put a label on it is I think totally in consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird will die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth that's right in front of us\nI think are a lot of why the comment has gotten the attention is that yes I'm as Eugene said um nationalism has a really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide\nAnd a World War Z I'm On the other hand I don't I think that some people have been a rounding nationalist up to white nationalist and that's a pretty big trip\nNow you could make a very cogent argument that President Trump is functionally a white nationalist in terms of his rhetoric in terms of his policies that so that's an arguable point um but he didn't say I'm a white nationalist he said I'm a nationalist anti is manifestly so I don't get why this is a big deal\nToday at noon here on an HP are\nMostly sunny across New Hampshire forward today with high temperatures in the

Vance algae beats he writes\nSocial conservatives voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beats he writes a that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it's just one of those amazing moments in about how different Americans here different things\nWhen it gets to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kirk emailed\nWhen was the meaning of gender changed to reflect the psychological state rather than a physical identity gender has always been a polite and more specific sending them for sex centers routinely used as such on birth certificates it seems that we're talking about here is more accurately described as sexual identity rather than gender itself\nKirk I'll take this went on actually that's not correct your sexual identity has to do with attraction gender has to do with identity sexuality has to do with who you see yourself with\nGender has to do with who you see yourself\nAs one more story related to the ... community today the remains of Matthew Shepard are settled in their final resting place\nAt the Washington National cathedral shepherd was brutally murdered Twenty years ago in the act in October of Nineteen Ninety eight by men who targeted the Twenty one year old University of Wyoming students for being gay\nHis death was a wake up call for many Americans to violence against el GB teach you people\nToday's ceremony drew hundreds to the cathedral for a musical event\nThat included several of shepherds favorite songs including imagine by John Lennon\nLet's get some more of your comments including about the refugee care of and and to be clear I think I misspoke earlier and said that the caravan as a possibility the care of it is real the troop plan is real it is possible that the care of and might not get to the border by May of misspoke when I brought that up\nBryan emailed is this column of potential immigrants really such a big deal it's not like they're trying to sneak in they're coming up to knock on her door to ask for help sounds like they're following our rules\nAnd tweeted can we please start calling the care of and what it is a group of refugees fleeing communities destroyed by two thousand nine military coup with which the U.S had a hand also wondering now has lots of you were commenting on this idea of nationalism let me read a few of your comments there\nIrrepressible youth tweeted a quote from George Orwell\nNationalism is hunger for power tempered by self deception\nDaniel tweeted why did Trump used the word nationalist instead of saying he was an American and Matthew tweeted or mess tweeted equating nationalism with white nationalism seems akin to the right rounding socialist\nPast each other more and more and demonizing their political opponents\nLet's talk about economic policy the president made a statement to reporters this week that he will propose new ten percent tax cut\nFor the middle class the president was somewhat vague in his timing for this to happen but said that quote will do the vote after the election Kathy Lohr I'd love to get your sense of what this means whether this was just something to say during the midterms or whether it seems that President really has a plan to continue making more tax cuts\nIt's just that I hate to say this but I don't think he has a point [laughter] I think that it is I'm\nPlaying to his base maybe trying to stand his base because the original tax cut that he promised I don't think it helped middle class people as was promised the first time so maybe this is an effort to do so it's an effort to get ... voters out\nFor this election and I asked them how do you see it\nI I don't think that we should even be talking about it on a news program until there's something more substantive for us to talk about an actual policy there's everything about this is just so an serious I'm right now\nAnd I think that if anything that we are playing into the president's a political a gambit by even acknowledging the existence of a plan that isn't even a plan I mean to to to bring it back to what we were just discussing with the migrant caravan\nUm uh making its way through Central America this is another place where I think the way that we are talking about it is inherently a complicit in\nUm uh in reinforcing really unrealistic and politically craven view of what's happening I'm four thousand people marching from uh the northern triangle country's under us a quarter mile an hour Salvador um through Mexico hoping some of them hoping to reach the United states\nThis does not represent any kind of significant uptick in the number of people seeking refuge from these increasingly violent countries they just happened to be in a big group it's more a reflection of a change in strategy among people trying to make that journey whereas previously they had tried to do it\nIn small groups to try to or not being noticed um that made them vulnerable to all kinds of hazards along the way and so there's a new strategy to try to go and ... openly in one big group that's all that's going on here border patrol apprehended\nUm about a hundred and fifty thousand people from the northern triangle countries and twenty Seventeen that's just the people that they caught right\nThis is not a significant number of people and therefore I'm not even sure that we should be talking about it that much it we should be talking about the broader phenomenon of migration from Central America and us complicity in destabilizing those countries and causing the violence there in the first place both from\nW E bf cobra Ninety point three W.

estimates the group of migrants heading on foot towards the U.S through Mexico currently has about seven thousand\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members on from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think is at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here\nIn America that have been moving up through Mexico that are heading to the U.S border and this is that something has been organized to kind of make the point of the plight of the migrants that um I have been trying to travel a very very long way to get to the U.S border and are seeking to come to the United states for\nEither reasons of economics at attraction or because they are fleeing some sort of threat\nUm and that this is sort of thing that happens every day and less organized fashion it's become though a weapon or for the trumpet for for Trump to use in advance in the mid term elections say look at all these scary people coming towards our border there might be middle Easterners and they're you know how do we know that they aren't you not bad people in that group but just just to quote his terminology used\nUm and this is kind of a poking at\nThe that that the existing um tension that exists in this country between people who are sympathetic toward the people who wants to come to the United states for various reasons of personal safety and economic instability and everything else\nAnd those people who think a scary outsiders don't let them in his plays a real well as Trump space Trump is trying to whip up his base in advance of the mid term elections because the Republicans need to hold on for dear life to make sure they keep\nThat majorities in both houses of Congress because house especially seems like it's quite likely to flip to Democrats and that will be at the problematic for Trump in the last two years of his first term so it is um classic\nA it's a very emotional issue for people on both sides of this issue and this is a classic uh politicking for how it's being portrayed right now I'm In an eye\nOn television on there who is is we're what two weeks out loud you mix away\nFrom the point at which um everybody's going to cast their ballots healing how they feel about you know the issues that affect the country and how the president's grappling with them\nBefore we continue talking about the care of and I'm Sorry I forgot to clarify something earlier in what we were discussing Michael Goldfarb raise the point\nAbout treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and we clarified that he did not attend the conference this so called Davos in the desert that his troops but just to be clear the treasury secretary did meet with Saudis crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon on Monday in Riyadh he did not attend the conference\nBut he and the crown prince did meet one on one earlier this week\nOn Monday just by way of clarification\nRavi president troops that President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the ...\nWell it it really is as car ruined was pointing out of ... thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping or countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor the V. as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOf their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives in the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no\nSoft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and settle down and have children and have better lives than simply and and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump ... and I guess Republican rhetoric\nThat play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a ... you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they or anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out uh current mentioned that President Trump a new to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there was actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly\nHe was using um Middle Eastern as a slower earth arts which which\nWould then we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence has said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry is aims for the country\n... that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation there but the the point I was getting too is that the use of the of of of Middle East and as the um ... is extremely dangerous because it it it eight then tries to create the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at a as common was pointing out again a movement that happens very often or you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now the numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here and the United states\nMichael Goldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful\nWith the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word and migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan\nIs a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel they are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them blamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug in Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of the English language\nMerriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nYou know just it was as you've been talking about this I I I suddenly had Woody Guthrie's old song about about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico in the Nineteen thirties and their plane crashed\nAnd they were cold deportees it's a beautiful song you look it up and many listeners should should strict YouTube after the show and and give it a listen there are many versions of it yeah you you know look I and I do think that in this case there there is a distinction you know we

O. X. P. O. P. in your store and we'll share some of your stories on Monday on one day\nBack now to\nRoughly ... of foreign policy magazine\nAnd Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast probably let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex of the prison industrial complex ... what did you make of of cooks remarks\nI thought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't say in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's the hats because I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the uh the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are but I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not\nRegulation of some ... some farm is is on its way it's coming and so\nAt some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states\nAnd the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it within tail and and and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe\nIs to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support as a of a potential data privacy laws in the United states\nWe should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation is this\nA you area law that protects the privacy the data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the you if you've noticed reading the last few months\nThat a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we maybe try your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups\nOn those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist miss treatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name\nBut then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nOr feel it's more juicy under a parliamentary privileged to blame for green as the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of his story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord pain or Baron the pain of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege\nTo name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this is such a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example a clear example of the very significant differences between\nFree speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of a drug store in in this particular case it happens in a parliamentary privileges is pretty\nUnique tool you can say things in parliament that you cannot say outside and and not suffer and any libel actions and Peter hand was a work\nSpoken to the Daily Telegraph this this guy of Phillip Green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to by Tony Blair for services to retail is set up a series of of\nUm clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy indeed [noise]\nAnd um apparently he was just the kind of ball she would expect it was a bully and he was\nSexually harassed people and [noise]\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements and the difference of course is that in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that\nAnd you know the details we can't get because of these nondisclosure agreements or at least we know his name and here in Britain it's something else\nYou know moving to a vote ... go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and I want [laughter] with what they're doing it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to say to have that that this this question which is the greater good here right because this is a\nThe the me too movement it's already been a question of can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful wealthy

I guess to see what is what society kind of values protecting more is it the reputation everyday accused in this way where it ended as can be applied newspapers that were never a party to them\nOr is it getting this out in the public space and so there's like an extra level in the u._k.\nAnd determining you know how much of a national or international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how we started out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections will Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they had to the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in this second round of voting\nFernando ... is on the left ... is on the right and ... and most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondents for the economist Sara welcome to want to\nThank for having me\nRemind us about ... he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\nBooker has been a congressman for a couple of decades now and I agree with the current owner or\nFor any particular letter saying that that are more for days at a tiny courier ... comment and a woman and a minority or in and go on and that wasn't going to\nBurn a provocative recognizing that a lot of people ... ... ... ... ... ... acres so\nUm it it could have a ... on the car and I both an outsider or you're on like that around and ... are kind of ... old and a country back on TALK\nShows that why he is so popular I mean you know that Brazil has had a number of issues that kind of a cascading issues with corruption over the years is it just kind of she's outsider status has eclipse any social misgivings or maybe about him\nThere\nOur number ... ... ... ... on ... and the poll but everyone look at it and during warm if it'd be kind of context", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "26"}
