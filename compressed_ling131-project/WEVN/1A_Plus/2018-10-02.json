let me get to some of your stories in comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it\nThe thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you're more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program thanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote\nI never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nAn unremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have been\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends\nAnd have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist I never want to make it about me and so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain and they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to just stay silent\nGot my own experience can you share with others to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um but over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had and been interested in learning other and\nWhen you drink a lot as you had Twenty years old at the time on and he drink more than I did a one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex\nAnd that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise and um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nAnd asked him to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly and you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought\nI dated him and I think now I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible and they hit the campus is the laughter ... the fur is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective why it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippie campuses and what it does\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise] Dr Ford in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are evolved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away\nYou when people who can encode that fit that fear about lying and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nYou help us do that with your contribution in any amount today at an H.

conversation with Lawrence Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorist in tone and we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to knowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from that\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years it it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so is shaped\nLoops thanks very much for sharing your story with his mortgage love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes\nAfter an incident like that after an attack like that wow and it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault\nOr it was one of the things that many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nAnd you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before I was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown and social research or you know that he shame and vulnerability right and I\nI and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel a huge sense of relief I was able to\nTo discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold on to that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't\nBeen able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend or family member but here in front of him I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's\nKnowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around and that uh I guess for me that's where\nWho I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of\nThe the embodiment of that injustice and that's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from Lawrence [noise]\nThat speak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who make that choice not to tell\n'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job\nUm but they are all very real at at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\n\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape at them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me\nWhen I tried to tell some people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others\nAnd I was called a complainer and people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emailed when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some work I could do for him if you check

I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and your\n... your your spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all that your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure\nThat we're all partake in in the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um it's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I eat a robot body or transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\nSo first of the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions is also reduce some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing\nTo put a human brain into a robotic chassis um when you could program that robotic Jesse to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put the put our consciousness I live I think that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is a evidence of that is how many books are still written on it that's evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity there's like three books we got grabbing [laughter]\nWe're not still writing books on its alone for the law you obey gravity so um but it it sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of translating brain what I really want is if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a O. S. at least find a way to transplant\nInto the body of I'm Sorry the brain of an ale less patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind\nThat this sounds very altered carbon even lost a lot of Netflix Amazon\n[laughter] very Frankenstein to it really I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly hope so and wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is this there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and the ... of water really carefully and say\nThey're no whales in the ocean [laughter] looking [laughter]\nBut you haven't looked there are so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy in our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but a ... anyone who study the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\n[noise] we're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous an asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it is the easier it is to detect\nSo so ah I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comet could come\nFrom out of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but in I regardless you want a healthy space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding protecting have any insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over and nature and we heed the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of guilt today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil and green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further out to eat people\nI don't want to eight people so\nThat the grid is too hot [laughter]\n[noise] right right so you so you so we have restoring forces in the world that prevent swing too low in in this regard and these\nIt involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ...
