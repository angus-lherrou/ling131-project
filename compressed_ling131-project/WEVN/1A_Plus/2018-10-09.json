last year to not release any body camera footage the public except for family members involved to view if I could make one law to increase mixed trust with the public this would be the one\nTo be shown wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd assess wrote on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people\nHearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this man guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nDisc or do I knew I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we do pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the\nKey to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many years ago and the grand case that basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officers engaged in the use of excessive force even less basically\nTake the in the state that that the steps of the state of the officer so it's a very subjective standard what would a reasonable officer have done it\nIn that situation so it is not an object that is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing what is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do it as a result you find very few judgments\nFirst of all you know in in civil ensuing police departments are jurors have to again how hold the standard\nAnd prosecutors before they decide to to charge an officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation has done so it is the Supreme Court that has set\nThis rule for all law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court said right all of that is the rule that is out there now\nVersus Connor it's a case from Nineteen eighty nine and so have you actually commented with regards to what's going on and officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like today was the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm to use deadly force and it is somehow justified\nThis is a career in which they signed up for similar to the military where they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve they're paid for this\nLet's add one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon ... the Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua\nNot understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you ... what happened that caused such stirred it has to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were\nActually involved and are running the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and\nThere for I began and operation dumped operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI use the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers one of them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular\nAmong the rank and file within to Chicago police department because before I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence was unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist\nA they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer have law enforcement in my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because I drugs all of us though why do you think it's not a similar mentality in law enforcement\n[noise] you know honestly a lot of police officers get approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on his police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually\nFear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common straight officers going against other officers when actually I learned that there\nLate ... corrupting the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of\nFear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it's easier and easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't\nWant to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\nWe'll let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's

let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward it where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard\nWe do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however Galvin had these questions Galvin writes\nThe question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force\nDoes a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot while they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions judge Cornell maybe you should respond to ... and how do we suss out in a finer sense what reasonable mess is\nOn us as in the eye of the beholder\nIt really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes\nOf the officer ... what was the officers thing and oftentimes incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it but I Do want us to\nGet this whole thing is Joshua about looking ahead I Believe it's time to wait\nToday's is quasi militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income community if\nThat's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals who lived in the community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community\nAnd it has dramatically changed we have police departments\nArmed to the teeth with tanks\nAnd all kinds of of the equipment\nThat a very commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically a patrol and and take care of traffic issues but why can't\nThat come from within the humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow the deputy ties to that deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslims and some of these judge colonel and I'm not disagreeing with your just by way of conflicts there are some places where a lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force and and they they do have a command structure and\n... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers\nAnd look at a different model entirely\nI'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened we we get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers some oh don't turn the cameras on or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order\nTicket footage out on for example in liquid shooting so\nThat that the whole lack of transparency\nPolicing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and policing we don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're discipline history it's very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think the dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland with this in our inbox\nI talked to who we both black and white and uh they seem to have this new it's risky approach to the community I haven't had experiences where you know we should that we would rather have conflict where are we mean\nRather than actually serve it I really think that they should\nYou know take away the guns for the first couple of months at least ... but he\nIs out of the community without guns make them stand up comedian before she might have a dialogue with me and got to do a lot better uh with serving a community\nWhere did you thinks we're calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin and love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast would read you said with another set of comments that we've gone from some of our listeners like what's scholar Rhodes Scholar rides\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality in whole people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict them but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time new ... would you say to folks who say that police work\nDangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue seat when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cordell said um how it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors\nWhen something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force\nWere you know none of the people are very few of the people the ones that you do know there's conflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before where the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community decides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever\nWith the community decides what's important were the community decides you know what\nWe can handle these issues at ground level\nWe just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political it's political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place until the community decides they come together and say we want control over our police departments\nAnd this is how we want to do it having that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing in review boards were part of it including on a larger scale\nJamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments they could be an objective trusted advisory board who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom and aggrieved local citizens group could appeal\nW.

Fox News with all due respect I don't get refused to go get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nCan't say enough good things about Jared and Yvonne guy Jared is such a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I'd done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the things that I Wish\nThere and I'm sitting in a strange and I often\nJust have to say I'm certainly thank you my family Michael at the same and um my two little ones I adore them and continue actually when you know they sacrificed a lot they've found a lot of time and energy into it um but they have a lot of heart\nAnd really wanted to make America proud and so with that I'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good slate and on for the next Vassar to come in but now\nI don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was I was governor for six years and we dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd do the years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to the south let's enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so thank you for having been out\nAnd I will say this I'm for all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty I can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president and the next election\nBut as Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with ... brown and maybe by way of a transition\nWe should get to an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nA ... absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune\nFrom the larger culture\nAnd I think we have seen just like we've seen increased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that people have to be careful and especially when there's power differential Z\nAnd it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of these other dividing line\nYeah 'cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just need to be the one person I Do to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being open and compassionate I knew that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love that is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful or significant come from mouth shut had down in my career that's just not how we make contributions\nAnd so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and rumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person\nAnd it's a muscle it's a foundational skills that I don't think spending\nWhat ... what do we spend about ...\nI don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor is something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high and we're not solving problems\nI Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experiences all of who you are to address the problems\nFor reading your book and based on the research that fueled the book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar yeah scars tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so ...\nYeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at gassy what I'm going to find but not in this case\nSo we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that there is a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are\nAnd these were MBA and NBA students at Wharton catalog Rice University\nAnd then tons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when it was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need braver leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear\nBut then we went and talked to several daring leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nI'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long and it was like so that blew my hypothesis of fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership is armor\nIt's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger that having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars and tender places\nNot only does armor\nKeep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow and metastasize\nSo we need to create were cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed\n[noise] we are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from

O. X. P.\nAnd we'll share some of your stories on Monday when our series the state we're in continues\nOn one day\nBack now to our conversation with Bernie brown author of the new book dear to lead with regards to arm or Monday ... emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this box because down trees are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK\nAnd so armor is not about professional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense it it is\nI Am going to put the protection of my ego before\nDoing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I meant to protect feeling good about myself over moving our work forward\nTo the difference between\nSo there's a difference between say armor an image such as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's on a more\nIt's on a deeper level now it's on a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor the armored leadership versus airing leadership as one form of armor we see a lot\nAnd folks is the need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting that right we\nGot a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures in broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant and an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust well here's what are the\nBiggest findings I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma is the is the law says on her ability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic incident I mean racism\nHomophobia poverty\nWhite supremacy I mean privilege desert desert everyday traumas and it is real that ... that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why it's leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off\nAnd be seen than we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of Anita Hill criticisms that happen after the Ford testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that it was all got\nYour dad who was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some\nOf mission statement or vision for clarification or posters everywhere saying this is yeah we're supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which is printed I work at some companies where I've been to some companies where their values statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well why don't we start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core value\nLifting the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list that I really struggled to open up their mind to why only two\nWell here's the thing if you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster I mean it\nReally is it just really a poster so we really don't move your point in my head but little will tell you [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know\nAnd so what was so you know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what\nI some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in and so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data the men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values\nThey had two to three values and you know I have you know there is a long list in the book like we talked about and there's like Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nOh truism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independents self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to at my ... my core values for me are facing courage\nI Know that the core values because it's the place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we had an we had a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operation allies and into behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them and then we have our company values and that's actually how we assessed shoot every quarter\nLoose on the values that you were to do it\nLike for example one of our values is take the care taking care of each other ourselves and the community we serve\nAnd so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people I mean you either do it or you doubt and so\nI think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that has a real core finding which has courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble with on her ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to clear it's used values I mean I I Would be fast foods and know what you lift me right now my core values are because I Know what they are I went through the list and I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my two were based on who I Am the work I Do like I guess one\nSure cut try sure OK face no\nThere's not one of my records but its encompassed in one of my two calls but no I didn't tell us what you are I don't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about vulnerabilities Russia I Know but I'm the host I don't have to do any I'm just I'm In charge here here we go people are OK okay fine I'll tell you what the\nFreedom and growth", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "09"}
