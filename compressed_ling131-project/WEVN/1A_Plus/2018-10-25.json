A. M. U. dot org\nThat common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back on some of the um some of the things that they submitted\nThat didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nSuzanne one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when Fred Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business has off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more\nThan devaluation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited\nThe trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seems ridiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuations of you know five ten million but on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several have you been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone riches engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we are talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements that the IRS endorsed sometimes after being pushed by a trust in a state attorneys\nI'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them the scratcher retained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump and his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties\nThere's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThan there are other aspects of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of when pat invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start a kicking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's [noise]\nUm and so those kind of things on a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I'd like to get to one more comment that were sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs he Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people every seed benefits and their father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far all I hear is that\nHe use certain ... to avoid paying taxes as we all do\nWe all take deductions standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with us Susanna what would you say to dress\nUp\nAt the top I mean these are standard deductions one one of the um one of the things that we wrote about the ... you mentioned um was a company that was set up it's it's interesting because it's true that the rich due to a lot of things\nTo avoid taxes the trumps cross the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to to fraud the ... the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nAnd reading from Dover turned his

it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ...

IRS um my county as the company where they\nHad they were ... voices in order to drain um fried Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it's sort of a ... a mix of they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where\nWe're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Russ have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late are are there statute of limitations that are involved\nThere are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's a fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City and New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax suit in which they don't ...\nI'm ... it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been\nFifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump in his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax that would have been a business tax um and it would have been substantially less than it's\nInteresting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be ... potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not paid taxes on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them pay but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax if they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of the kinds of stands out is how\nFred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips at one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSo that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a a money he owns over till lenders um and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father is a lawyer showed up\nWith checks totaling three and a half million dollars bought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment and get over that hump\nWonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if even if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's rent\nLaw on the trumps and make an example of them how much did they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nWell big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it that potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um\nThey're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money that tote so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities um another authorities could be looking at 'em\nWith us today have ended up in in federal prison for this\n[noise] ...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who would choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county\nThey were filing false documents or with a state agency um and there would be lower level charges that would flow to that and yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our other listeners feel is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none\nSuzanne ...\nInteresting comments that had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has\nHas stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made billionaire um there's no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire\nBut what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his

international attention\n[noise] well it's an outrageous ... to uh to use that kind of substance on the on the streets of a foreign city in order to secular school I think he is something that a lot of people find extraordinary and you know\nIn in both senses of that would that it's an extraordinarily provocative thing but some people I think to have trouble\nBelieving the British Government narrative its details\nI have to say though you know as time has gone on and particularly things we've seen in the last month now\nWith the identification of two suspects and then Russian Jen this than the experts working to find out the real identities of those people who came to the u._k. on student and and then to link them to this minute tree intelligence service the geo you you know it'll do seem to be pointing pretty clearly in that direction\nLet's talk more about the G are you what exactly is it and what does it do\nWell at the Russian initials a stand for main intelligence directorate and it's the it's a direct threats all\nThe Russian general stuff the ...\nOr the ... that I think some plans for the Russian ministry and this is the same income of countries that historically the general stuff will have its own intelligence department and that's been the case you know changing one or two that bureaucratic details but more or less since the Russian civil war in the early twentieth century\nThat the a Soviet than Russian general stuff has had this organization and ate embraces a whole a sway the capabilities and the idea of a vivid kid reconnaissance so intelligence as practiced by the geo use a very broad concept\nAnd that can be two guys creeping forward on their bellies in eastern Ukraine trying to see if they can ... the Ukrainian full says and basically ... as soldiers on the battlefield and it can be a guy in a ... tell policy in Madrid in Nineteen Ninety six ... ... ... who was serving that on direct\nOn sitting in technical for sex tree

I and a very broad capabilities\nAudits Sergei Skripal joined the G argue well joining the GI you particularly ah back in the Soviet period when he got involved or he was invited in Nineteen Seventy nine\nIt was a pretty mysterious thing you weren't supposed to really know about it you couldn't supply it was them who approached cue and he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things like they went into China or on the cover and\nYou know and there are other missions as well but uh described in my book\nAnd I think this protein to the attention of the G all you as being the kind of steely guy who who had the right stuff and they invite you to ... an exam and he goes through that later that year he started at the what's called a minute to diplomatic academy which is effectively that spy school to Moscow\nWay you've spent four years uh doing everything from you know the real um spy novel trade crossed off of agent meats and counter surveillance\nA ... means of communications from ... to secret writing to\nYou know encrypted email all that stuff\nI Am through to intelligence analysis and the rest of it so it's a very sorry grounding that they get ... and having done all that he got sent off or not the full to move to\nA on his first job working on the diplomatic cover and that's what a generally speaking a lot of these gee all you people who have deployed strategic intelligence gathering that's what they do they assume of civilian personnel let's say\nOr maybe ... maybe in the embassy maybe in a trade mission and they carry on with that tree intelligence and they said all of these people you mentioned in your introduction expelled from the U.S\nAre following the soles free incidents where gee all you people working in in Russian organizations in\nWashington and New York describes Sergei Skripal and his day what did he look like how did he come across well he's pretty he's a well

rural coverage you know throwing itself out airplane at nights into an ... kind of stuff\nOr ... and so you know he's a tough guy he's he's broad um of course now in his mid sixties or he doesn't have quite the same physical condition you did back when he was working with a jail you but he's still a fairly um striking physical presence he's got a very dry sense of humor\nI'm a deadpan and you know tends to make light of the sort of negative things in life so when we were talking\nAbout his experiences under interrogation in the fall to the prison in Moscow well then in the labor camp he was sent to you know he would struggle lots of it off and say well I got this fix them on Iran for that to happen and you know this made me more comfortable and and you know he doesn't last thing I think he would have said was\nYou know I had a terrible time already suffered you know because he and his in his military career and and doing the things we've done in the jail you read over she'd been in

U. dot org tweet us at one at a or comments on our Facebook page regarding the poisoning Martin asks\nThere were five people substantially exposed to the nerve agent insults break one of whom died what's the condition of the others mark\n[noise] um well ah so those on the people on Nick Bailey who was a police officer who went to this ... house on the day of the poisoning he is a much better but still not ready to return to work [noise]\nUh of course a Charlie Rowley who was one of those\nWho are then found the bustle\nOr in the summer in June and uh he's caught in the dorm study says the person who died Charlie rarely lightning Bailey is to have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well for a week or two but he also has made a recovery of salts\nAnd then of course you get to UT a script pile and ... and\nUh she was discharged from hospital a several weeks before he was once again I think one can infer from that but uh how to a lesser dosage\nAnd so I suppose you could say the most serious they affected person who survived well ... himself\nUm when I interviewed the medical stuff their hospital you ... you had a clip earlier of ah don't just even jokes they was saying well\nAh we think that will be long term side effects ... it's very hard for us to predict what may also I think one would still say that ... call themselves as in the process of ... my understanding that there are some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people are not a keen to discuss the specifics that are both because it's an issue of ... medical confidentiality and a bit of I think there are still quote of unknowns\nWith regard to Yulia ... daughter ... emailed\nIt's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental casualty however her fiance was a gi argue employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to ride also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London\nConsidering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it seems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident the big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order mark\nI'm well I I'll just pick colds and one little bits of an has a description that the the two people the two suspects or did not flying on the same plane as you describe how they arrived the previous day as a different ... got wake\nA she arrived in on the science data sowed amounts at Heathrow\nA on a plane for mostly but anyway um\nLet's just talk about uh that's just a detail um look there is definitely something over ... about a half\nArrival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack\nI'm ... and right from the outset people I was speaking to who were involved in in trying to work out what has happened investigation or believed that the timing was critical\nNow we know even more so that the uh suspects are named as ... had been in the u._k. on exactly the same period\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you

seems to have come back to be with her daddy Shia around that time because have bravo Sasha how to use both stay on the first of march [noise]\nSo that's the ... uh by a lake twenty Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically Sasha by the way had died but it's still supposed that she had come in twenty Eighteen to be with her dad at night time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were all normally together as a family\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigators that the timing of the attack was critically linked\nTo use his arrival that are hacking hug day to buy the emails and stuff which said sure I'll come up from the apple is that your centers that Trump would help them to locate to make sure he wasn't a business trip or in some other way absence\nAnd uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that I'm Yulia had boats\nAnd he is a bit of a cab yet he is filled by some to have had connections with a one of the Russian intelligence agency thought he was not on the scene for example back in twenty six dating when it's believed that this um figure I'm using the names like if it does have traveled to the u._k.\nHe was not on the scene back in ... when we know according to the u._k. government that her email account was hacked\nAnd he hadn't been on the scene so much

[noise]\nUh well nearly among solved there was a coat hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was ... that he had not been in touch with a hospital for example to find out how she

reached out to him or whether indeed they often ... by a social media or messaging ... or email or whatever or buts we have to assume that they no longer income times\nTo get to a few more of your

the ... are you do have a sense of whether there was a last straw for ...\nUm yeah that's a good question um the way he describes it and it was a gradual process so when he was in middle to which is
