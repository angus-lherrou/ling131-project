A. M. U. dot org we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this care elaborately I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother\nTo uh that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we applied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted and it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get\nAll kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required\nProving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time I mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community as one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about is shown is was hunted bastard on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted vested on think about that long arc\nYeah yes I I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits of being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledged citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us\nIs to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land the water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA tests is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it they take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with them mugging titled meant like they've lived the life of a native\nLike somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies out the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say fine nurture ancestry and learn what your family's from\nWe did a program today's October seventeenth we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nAre named Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about would be in a can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you are going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one daughter a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help me to issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\nYou ate progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you ate progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota has\nA voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court at decided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election\nSo what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election as you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who is one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPause have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters\nShe had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota and that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law could potentially saw heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed at\nBecause they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nAnd what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law require the central\nIssue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box as they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members on from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think is at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here\nThe state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even added vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot and the wrong precinct would this would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address is somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from you if you're in North Dakota but email us one a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one a or comment on our Facebook page\nJerry what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law is affecting them is this on people's radar is this kind of more of a a a smaller issue\nI'd say it is and also you have to put it against the larger contact\nOr you'd see it as it is a is a big issue or does it smell\nOh I think it's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nI'm a you know it's really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the state ... it was the lowest in the state before\nThis and that's because there are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now becoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their\nWill be at the Capitol Center for the arts encountered on Thursday get your tickets right now at the C.

U. dot org\nLet's read one more eggs or from the book this is about something that happened to you and your mother or when you were younger not real far from here in Maryland and it is a law ... eighty one would you mind reading from it's about halfway down patriots won the part that begins when we were half a mile from home\nSo almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying would you read that first please\nA sure any one of the ... when we were ever okay when we were half a mile from home or Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi you set up in your seat kept ... kept both hands on the wheel and looked straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland I D and took my red black and green African medallion it into my public enemy T shirt he told me to sit up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nOfficer now down and lifting your window when I saw your face or close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits\nOfficer asked why we had in Mississippi license place because we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say I have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park have I done anything wrong officer when officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip\nOn the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signal and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face as he asked for your license and registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to your hands came up to staring well and you pointed at the officers face move away from my car you said that as much as he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may not have your badge number please\nI hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions\nGolf to ask both of us to step out of the car\nWe will not get out of his car you said louder this time we have done nothing wrong my fist were bald up and I was inching toward the driver's side window you slapped me across much that's what the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unclean from office right as another officer pulled up\nThe first officer who's now laughing walked back to the second officers car you eventually show the second officer your license and your University of Maryland and the officer looked at the id\nFlipped it over and told us to have a good night never give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it\nI'm Wondering why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back Mississippi Maryland it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot your black but out of this guy every chance they get\nIf you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you killed yourself I hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't\nAnd they instead of their though if I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said oh you wouldn't I told you\nThat for that matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though I Do not need saving you say\nI'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species with a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop game in a bubble goods\nYou laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't well I was in my room changing you told me to write about what I learned from experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cut it in a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky and the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison\nIf they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style of fly\nOut of their eggs are cruel heavy psyche essay lame and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crux of a lot of uh the relationship or talk about in this book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school and eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd um my best friends from a previous school were there and one of my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way he did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson\nAnd long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put the knife away treated a knife as if it was a gun or we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers\nAnd in that situation I learned that sometimes and often um and mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so uh my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEat in a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble\nLater I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure about this\nThis a theory my mom ahead you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home life when you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and why power doing un\nThat's the question I'm trying to ask him infection and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand them how did that affect your relationship with her\nOne way I think a lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were right some things that were wrong um she started to be a a a lot more active\nIn trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more\nUm but and we could talk about those things sort it we could talk about police we could talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about was like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that fighting that protection she saw me and relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself where I was mistreating people emotionally\nWe didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of at talking about how we survive outside of the house the particular kinds of violence as they were happening in my house were completely um silent we never knew how to talk about it\nYears old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our house I Want to talk\nMore about your literary style but I did want to point out one other aspect of the antics don't you just read", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Keene", "day": "17"}
