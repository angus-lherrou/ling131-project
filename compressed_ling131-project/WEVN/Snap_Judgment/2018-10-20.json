affront to whatever was there\nIt was just like a a gated off a unit or on the first floor and I walked over there and really yeah basically like a storage space I mean exactly like a storage space and there's just a very simple\nSymmetrical wrought iron gate on front\n\nThose wrought iron gates are so loud that three of us walked up and got really low to the ground and just grab the gay on the

[noise]\nThat's right [noise] Mike ... news on the floor at the addict tossed into a dusty corner\nTied to distract two cents to make light of makes terrific discovery as best he could [noise] but still [noise] everyone was shaken up [noise]\nAnd I think we all kind of feel like that's when things\nEscalate it got worse for us [noise]\n\nMike and cat Lewis fight on the weekends and with their mom during the week when the kids who with their mom Fred was all alone in house\nI was getting ready to go to work I had a a a daytime appointment book which was vital to me\nAnd I was in a rush and I had to put this book on top of a ban is or post these were the stairs leading to the front door downstairs\nAnd I put it on a post to simply time my shoes now I Know I put it on the post is no doubt [noise] I've been down in time I Do I get up\nIt's gone [noise] I went so far to go into the garage to see if I left it in my car I'm I have to find this one [noise] I'd come back and it's on the post flipped\nOver upside down [noise] and I just grabbed it and ran out of the house\nAnd then there was a light in the attic\nAt least once or twice a week when I Would come home the addict like would be on so much so that I Would have to I Will be the only one really to access go upstairs shut it off\nOf course it would creep me out\nYou try to rationalize I don't want to believe that something is here messing with me\nOn the weekends when cat and micro with him friend never mentioned the things he experienced he didn't want them to get scared away but still cat and might help to pick up on the fact that something was\nOff about the apartment\nAt the corner of your eyes and as soon as he turned to them nothing would be there\nCould barely ever sleep\nSo I'm lying in bed awake [noise]\nAh [noise]\nWith my door open holy laid on trying to ignore the uneasy feeling that was always president and I are here in the sink turn on in the kitchen\n[noise] uh every one is in their separate bedrooms and I know nobody turned it on\nFred Mike in cat never told each other they thought something was going on to barely believe themselves still about six months after moving in del decided to should get a kitten we got the cat\nAs kind of a warm fuzzy presence in the house I think we're all feeling like\nTurmoil and darkness kind of going on in our personal lives that we just wanted something to make us\nTo come home every day and I remember we were so excited\nTo bring the cat home [noise]\nShe was just such a warm sweet cat and\nIt was really nice to have her around [noise]\nThe kitten seem to make the apartment a little brighter [noise]\nThrough the night when kids forgotten kitten would snuggle up next to him\nBut then something strange happening\n\nMy bedroom was always dark and dingy I remember we painted clouds all over my wall to try to break it up and make it feel a little more cheery and but I still had this feeling of dread every time I go into my bedroom\nCatch it having really existed Corinne nightmares there would be a man standing over my bad staring down at me watching me sleep\nAnd he would take his fingers and run them down the flash on my face and I began waking up with scratches\n[noise]\nAt first I thought the kitten may be scratching his doctors face [noise]\nShe was in [noise] my dad decided that he was going to try something to see if this would help because I think he was worried that it was a self inflicted kind of scratch and\nShe decided to tape mittens to me at night to see if\nI could stop myself from scratching and still I Would wake up wet scratches that my [noise]\nI almost feel like this thing was kind of feeding on our energy we were in a bad state we all were traumatized we had a lot of negative things going on in our lives it was a it was a bad transition for for all of us [noise] and I think that definitely awoke whatever was there and made things worse\nFred cat and make were closed and he managed to find comfort in each other and thinks that the apartment got to be too much\nWeekends at the apartment my dad and I would go out all day we would send the day outside doing fun things just trying to get some fresh air and lighten the mood a little bat and a\nWe came home and we could hear\nThe cat and yelling [noise] but she didn't come running to us [noise]\nAnd usually the second we came home she had kind of ... the kitchen and say hello and we thought it was odd that she's not anywhere to be found but we can hear her soft little meow so making eye and dad we searched all over the house looking for the cat thinking\nWho knows what happened and and I found her\nIn my bedroom and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "city": "Keene", "day": "20"}
