Tommy Caldwell except rotted John Dickey pro rock climbing [noise] pro the freest of the breed the bravest brave to paint travel the world and climbed the hardest in most things I\nIn two thousand north state sponsored the for them to climb in the mountains of Kurdistan to scale famous yellow\nThis location and Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year they got a destination yes\n[noise] the climate for you to massive peaks and dangerous clip faces but still as their helicopter descended into the ... valley and the yellow wall came into view they were blown away\nAnd not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this logging get across the river\nAnd ... came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand them form of um the rock and he was terrified of rocking has laws\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if he didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me his rifle and I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind starting to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he's patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and have to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goes and they praying they mind their own business\nBut there's this guy in their country that's in charge for a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of my from splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained that John but we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was in and get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then when we're all going to go home\nThe captors plan was to focus\nUltimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the John that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember about that myself we're pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we'd seen them murders somebody I very much saw them as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nMercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats mine and jump on this guy and just by just throw his teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker raw and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nMm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain one of their captors ... split on now is only two captors with guns to far climbers they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was\nAnd you start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again [noise] and then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we take guesses and\nIt turns out it and then five minutes and I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time the days just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd don't seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys his Base Camp and now I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUp the mountain along with only one of his men as gardening\nAnd that one guard let's do\nHe kinda weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and obviously man that he had bought this story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and back then to not [noise] is served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him became shot anyways has Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him enough ago he he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off they split\nUp dual tracking down towards the Base Camp\nWell Jason and his crew led to up the mountain\nNow it was four to ... [noise]\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode there was just as\nBall excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy has got to guns and the anger named the knife in your move like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified and on this sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so\nJohn and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that the game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find a I'm\nTrying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there were like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe\nMorally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and when racing up\nThe class and it just\nSort of scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm\nBut as I was reaching out to grab his gun struck the sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out I grabbed his gun strap and I\nPulled as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards or\nHe just kind of wanting to spark through them and like any turn and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact and the whole way down\nAnd so he had the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let us really horrible uh cracking sound because really loud and then he tumbled often the darkness\nAt the time this chance some like that this is huge brother Spencer and while stewardess states or great all spent you know like everyone and his family to be all hearts and free spirit he loves being outdoors listened to the way he talks about mountain biking\nI liked it I can just zone out and just focus home peddling dropped my head down to really like ... cranks revolving just felt like one two one two something like that you kinda\nYou know you had done such a joy and you're just like wind down it\nAnd it's been two would always happy and healthy do\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old since you've started getting headaches to very terrible headache\nAnd he was diagnosed with an al formation in his brain\n[noise] I mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain now from Asians\nBecause he was crazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but ... didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would result\nAnd this was about the time when it's going to became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never had surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just across the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his end but\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one and how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's about ... about it and do you remember what you might have been scared\nNot that coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is when I was scared of\nA different person since it was scary his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes people experience\nLots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous\nLike there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him spent he was worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything wasn't all men are familiar made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure\nEven if they help you know\nThere was a conversation that I had with him at some point [noise] expressing from my regret about my own stir insurance because I still have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime\nMinute there and to him nuts [noise] one of my\nBiggest regrets with the surgery is just not in my surgeries and\nIt's made me a [noise] somewhat better person at times [noise]\nUm\n[noise] so can I get a little fish philosophical with you there's some try [laughter] okay um so in like Julie ... story with Amy I'm been forced to\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so\nAnd I'm Wondering if that's ten term it's by our brain\nOr something let physical and I wonder what your thoughts are\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly somebody to set a goal to their we spend to having a severe headache again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle when we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I and Spencer was just talking butter which you're British\nAnd shortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bed holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read and there for a few minutes as I watched and try to\nCatch his breath I I I thought we would lose them\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to ... hospital room in the ice you [noise]\nTo see them\nIn a coma and\nCondition than I Am hopeful only I Would have to\nHave dealt with and I wish I could have been union\n\n[noise] and\nTo take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but you know family you should never have to make\nA snap judgment the override episode continues stay too [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] three\nForty six this is New Hampshire public radio good
