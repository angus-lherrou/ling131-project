[noise]\n\nIt's bull's eye I'm Jesse foreign I'm so excited to welcome Susan Orlean back to our show Susan is a staff writer at the New Yorker she's also appeared in vogue and Esquire on this American Life\nShe's the author eight books covering topics like New England Saturday Night in America an orchid fanatics last one the or could the F ended up being the basis of the Academy Award nominated film adaptation Susan is uh disarming interviewer\nA meticulous researcher and a beautiful writer these days she lives here in Los Angeles where we make our show\nAnd being an author and to read or she has visited the beautiful historic central library here\nDozens and dozens of times her latest book is about ... library and its history and particularly about the devastating fire that almost demolish the librarian Nineteen eighty six\nThe book is also kind of a pay on to libraries everywhere or demean her what they mean to us and why every library is a vital institution\nThe book is called the library book it's one of my favorites I read this year Susan Orlean a welcome back troubles I always happens you\nIt's great to be with you Susan what is your relationship with libraries personally other than your obvious financial relationship right [laughter]\nOne would hope um well I grew up going to the library that was very much a part of my childhood and my parents were great\nLibrary doors they didn't really believe in buying books they I think they felt like why would you buy a book you go to the library and borrow the book and if it's not and you put your name on a whole list and you get it when it's available\nAnd they were born in the depression and I'm sure that's a lot of it which is that buying books seemed like a bit of an indulgence that wasn't necessary\nI grew up going to the library a couple of times a week with my mom and I found it\nAbsolutely magical it was not like going to a bookstore or a toy store it was partly because there was no money there was no financial relationship and when you're a kid the idea that you can have anything you want is really intoxicating\nAnd a library is ... ... on a real short list of places that welcome everyone including kids were a hassle right [laughter] well and I do think\nThat in the last Twenty years we've as a society become more and more\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from

learn more at revision energy dot com slash careers it\nI think it's why people go to co working space is I think it's why people go to public parks even if they've got a backyard there's something very special about being somewhere around other people and you're not there to interact with them you're just sharing space with them\nAnd that's definitely some a quality of libraries I mean they're they're closest analog is probably a public park\nYou have written for the New Yorker for thirty some years [laughter] and you're a New Yorker for a long time how did your experience of living in Los Angeles compared to your expectations about Los Angeles [noise]\nHad travelled here a lot over the years before I moved here and ... had been downtown once as far as I knew [noise]\nUm my expectation of Los Angeles was that I Would never spend time downtown and at the time I moved here which is now seven years ago [noise]\nDowntown was just on the brink of really changing and revitalizing and re populating\nI never imagined that I Would be doing a book about the library I moved to Los Angeles because my husband was asked to help with the company and that was starting up and we thought well that'd be fun and we'll go for a year or we'll get some nice weather and go back to New York at the end of the year\nIn the course of being here I was given a tour of the downtown library and first of all I thought oh my God this building is amazing it's a beautiful building and a very eccentric interesting piece of architecture Nineteen twenties era but [noise]\nInflicted with all of this sort of addiction and Moroccan kind of a aesthetic and it's a really interesting buildings so I was kind of\nStruck immediately just about what it called building it was and how I had never been downtown to see it [noise]\nBut walking through the library and thinking boy this is just an incredible repository of amazing stories I was being told some of the stories of of various city librarians who would run library over the years many of whom were incredibly eccentric\nFascinating figures and\nI found myself just being drawn in more and more thinking oh my God this is an amazing place somebody should write about this not thinking that somebody was me um\nAnd right at that moment the person giving me the tour had pulled one of the books off the shelf and took a deep with the book\nI thought well I guess I'm In a new city where people do things like smells books and I kind of dismissed it until he said well even still smell the smoke and some of them\nAnd I thought how they used to let people smoke in the library that seem very bold and I said well you know was back when they allowed smoking and he said no no they never allow smoking in the building it was from the fire\nMore with Susan Orlean after a quick break they never convicted anyone starting the Nineteen eighty six library fire Suzie will tell me why when she started her library book she thought she could solve the case it's

of other publications as well her books include the orchid the fringe in tune and Saturday Night her newest tells the story of the Los Angeles public library and so much more it's called the library book hits bookstores this week\nThe arson investigators ... eventually decided that our son had been the cause of the fire\nWho was the person who was accused of having started at\nA young man in his twenties named Harry peak who was um\nI guess predictably a wannabe actor\nErrand boy I'm you know did odd jobs parked cars that kind of thing um was well what what happened was he had told a number of friends that he had started the fire so very quickly ... ah [noise]\nOnce there was a reward\nAssociated with anyone having ... providing a tip for solving the fire a one of his friends good to have friends that came forward and\nUm basically connected the fire department to him and they began following them around and ended up\nI'm interviewing him to figure out whether his boasts of having started the fire we're we're in fact true because he was a charming liar he\nWas from every description I had from anybody he was an immensely likeable guy charming and just a crazy if ever owned would just tip about stupid thing not\nJust them he'd say where where have you been to I was having drinks with share\nYou know he just couldn't tell us straight story and\nHis friends would it were exasperated by him in at the same time also said he was a really good guy would give you the shirt off his back and that was interesting to me they all use that exact expression he would give you the shirt off his back he was\nThe love and and also drove them crazy\nSo in a way this is what might be called a true crime narrative I guess and I wonder if you felt pressured by the fact that you were telling a crime story\nTo have a narrative that resolved comfortably to provide an answer to the question\nI I did I first of all I thought I'm going to solve this which is utterly veins [laughter] I mean that there is no way that as civilian with no access to\nThe evidence and no knowledge of how to investigate and arson would be able to crack the case but that was my first thought is I'm going to solve this [noise] um and\nMaybe if you had a ragtag band friends it right and like the original van has\nCome on guys and a big dog right isn't that the\nI'm I'm fairly comfortable with the idea that\nI don't have to come to a final conclusion and it may be\nOut of the reality of so many of the things I write about don't have a tidy conclusion or don't resolve in the way that I might have expected them to resolve in this case I think following the different possible outcomes it's a bit of a choose your own adventure and [noise]\nAnd you come to your own conclusion essentially a because there's no way to reexamine the evidence\nAt this point what I've\nTried to do is lay out all the different paths of thought that could lead you to a conclusion [noise]\nIt may be that when I wrote the orchid safe and I was determined to see a ghost or good and as time is growing short and I thought oh my God the book is ruined I'm never going to see a ghost shortcut and I finally had a deadline that I had to make\nAnd I didn't see one\nSuddenly it seemed like well of course I'm not going to see one\nThat's that's the point it's\nIt doesn't matter that I'm not going to see it it it would never match the anticipation of seeing it so it was the first experience I had a ... conclusion conclusion and in its own way and I felt\nI mean it is the reality it is the fact is without giving anything away it's\nIt's not possible to come to a conclusion I mean my my notion that I Would solve it being something that very quickly I realize that's nuts but\nIt isn't possible to\nUltimately no what happened and I was comfortable finally thinking that's OK I'm giving you the different paths of thought and and um maybe you see the one of them being the persuasive one\nWell Susan Arlene I

Vance a you know black people but ... you know you can you could say that just by\nChecking out some of the things that he uh you know how forceful was he was he on the front lines of in in in marching\nJust his being there his eloquence his genius ... this is a thing that knew exactly who he was he was the darkness of dark\nHe knew he exactly who he was and he knew he was you know there was a perception of the perceived threat and his blackness but he took it and he grace did so beautifully\nAnd even if it even affected some of the songs that she chose to sing the idea of singing love songs to love love songs to humanity\nSmile\nNature boy pick yourself up this type of song in a way is is uniquely connected to him because their love songs to love and to life\nAnd that's just profoundly affected me but in a way it was a thing that he in some in some way had to do because you know swooning after Nat King Cole was not a popular thing\nFor you know many parents and many people's minds at the time\nYou know in some ways I called him the the original Iraq Obama because he he knew who he was and he knew how he had to uh you know traverse this world and he knew he had to do it with grace\nAnd he did and he still got his message across now I think about you know people think about his his lyrics and it was like oh it's you know he's in the sky and he's he's you know it's just so you know milk toast and sweet but\nThink about a song like pick yourself up dust yourself off and start all over again think about that song for somebody who had been pushed down who had been mistreated\nWho had been punched kicked bitten in the civil rights struggle pick yourself up just yourself off start all over again means something totally different to them totally different it means something totally different than my mother\nSmile though your heart is they can mean something totally different to her you know\n... to the people that are on the underneath to the people who have been pushed down many a net songs means something totally different it's encouragement is optimism\nAnd I'm so when we talk about his contribution to people that are on the underneath you absolutely have to consider these these lyrics that I hear now and that they still four to five people you have to think of that um\nSo he had he had a great great contribution you know first\nA first black men have his OWN TV show and and uh you know just the experiment of that was really something extraordinary for and if you know for an American culture that that wasn't a wasn't so open to that and\nWell let's hear my guess Gregory Porter singing pick yourself up his most recent record is called Nat King Cole\nIt yourself or [noise] take a deep breath [noise]\nJust just a small start all over again [noise]\nNothing's impossible I have a problem when much on around you know some of the auto or a man [noise]\nI'm Jesse ... listening to both I my guess is the jazz singer and pride of Bakersfield, California Greg reporter\nI hear you often compared to build weather's you know go where there's you know maybe my favorite ever\nYou know what I'm saying like be careful with those ...
