[noise]\nComing up we'll talk to Sarah Jessica Parker about her role stories in the HBO so your divorce she'll tell me about where she got the inspiration for shows tone [noise]\nSeventies cinema was the central inspiration for me I mean that's what I kept surfing around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and [noise] you know all the great movies in the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play a really important role but I imagine that fat\nMusic the music as separate young people they fell in love to you know then later\nHis

coming up on both sides let's go [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIt's bull's eye I'm Jesse Thorn in a resume that has spent decades Sarah Jessica Parker has performed some of the most compelling characters in TV and film\nShe kicked off her career adjust Fifteen starring on the CBS teenage comedy square pegs from there she appeared in movies like footloose LA Story and hocus pocus\nAnd there's also some show called sex in the city no big deal\nWhen I talked with her a couple of years ago she just launched another new show on HBO it's called divorced its second season wrapped up earlier this year\nThey're working on a third one now it's a dramatic that talks about the end of a marriage and the wreckage and birth that you find in its wake Sarah plays Francis a corporate recruiter who's been with her husband Robert played by Thomas Hayden church for Seventeen years church and Parker\nDon't really want to call it chemistry since they're splitting up on the show but there was something compelling by the way they interact on screen the series takes on topics like commitment fidelity even finances in a very Frank and sometimes very funny way\nHere's a little bit from the first season of divorce in this scene from the show's pilot Francis gives her husband the news\nIs that last Christmas\nFishing in Alaska\n... hang on a second that's the only time of the year that the Chinook salmon run in those numbers and you said you didn't mind\nI didn't mind it was the best Christmas our problem in years You're welcome sometimes I come home from work I'm happy\nI actually feel happy\nWhen I see your car parked in our ... year high on\nThis is about my own job is and what this is the one to save my life while I still care about it\nBut don't love you anymore\n\nOn divorce\nSarah Jessica Parker welcome the bulls eye thank you thank you so much for having me I Want to ask you something I'm a serious to begin with which is I had this experience or a couple\nOf years ago where a a pair of good friends of myself and my wife\nA split up they were married and um my my own parents were divorced when I was very young and I you know I always thought that was for the better I mean they didn't get along um but when these friends of mine were splitting up\nUh I sort of freaked out\n[laughter] I was really legitimately freaking out about it these people live three thousand miles from me [laughter] that guy I care about the very much but they I see them once a year [laughter] right\nAnd a eight or it occurred to me like how intense I just I guess I just never acts I just walled off that part of my ... my\nSupport for an HBO ... live stream comes from you our listeners and from service credit union supporting businesses throughout New Hampshire from visionary development projects to fundamental banking needs programs and services designed for businesses who are ready to grow more I grow with SCU dot com\nUm the experiences I'm not I'm not a\nPersonal exploration for me you know uh in terms of trying to sort out my own home life but rather I guess in some ways what you've described as witnessing your friends marriage fell apart you know for me it's a fascinating way to spend a lot of hours because\nI I guess you know the reason that I was interested in it initially in developing the show was because I I I like yourself I was watching friends marriage a fall apart I was witnessing friends um contemplate affairs\nFriends have affairs marriage survives affairs marriage be better for having ... having one party or have an affair you know I um people contemplating divorced not divorced and all those things that surround\nUm surround you when you reach a certain point in your life and people have been in committed relationships meaningful\nSubstantive relationships\nI liked very much exploring it it's the exact way I wanted to do it it's the town that I was hoping for\nBecause it's for some it's devastating for others it's I'm an opportunity to sort of um make alliances um and I think it's really complex I think people's reactions to divorced when it's not their own are really\nOften surprising to themselves\nDoes it does it freak you out I mean the the way when you spend time with it in your heart do you do you feel freaked out and I don't mean like in the sense liquor does it make you feel like a a you and your husband are going to get divorced\nUm what like it's it's like an existential dread for me [laughter]\n[noise] I think I I think it doesn't freak me out sometimes it makes me very sad um and I'm I'm\nI I don't know I'm not I'm not freaked out by it because it's both\nAn artistic an academic exercise in some ways and for me I guess I've been an actor for so long that I\nUm I have found a way to compartmentalize the work um I also come home to three children and uh the active household and chaos and\nUm I don't I'm not at liberty to let it um penetrate really beyond the threshold in some way of my own home um but I Love the story I like\nPushing on the bruise I I've always been that way and\nUm I I'm\nMuch more interested in the potential to be freaked out than not\nI Want to play a pushing on the bruise scene from divorce\nSo ah your character whose name is Francis is a head hunter and this is the use of the cold open to the third episode and she's sitting down with a client who's looking for a new good um and they have this conversation\nFor never thought I'd be the kind of drug use is actually the ... or don't want to know what's out there [noise] okay uh what are you looking for I'm not sure this job for twenty plus years says the same thing over and over and over and over again\nAnd in the NPR wind club where members receive NPR inspired wind like weekend edition cabernet and wait wait don't tell me Marlowe available to adults Twenty one years or older learn more at NPR wine club dot org this is NPR [noise]\nIt's ... I'm just before my guest is Sarah Jessica Parker we talked in twenty sixteen she is of course the star of sex in the city she's also been in films including LA Story footloose and the first wives club she's currently starring in the HBO show divorce your husband is a actor Matthew Broderick\nDid you have a relationship with his work before you knew him as a human being like I mean like I'm not I'm not telling you everything you don't know\nBut like he was ... for example [laughter]\nI'm not only did I have a relationship but with his work but before\nI met him um I when I met him I realized wow I paid for all your movies meaning it has an audience I couldn't say that about a lot I could say about Woody Allen's movies from the time I was young child be always went to see Woody Allen movies [noise]\nUm and when I was in Utah shooting footloose\nThat summer I think Matthew at maybe two movies out and I didn't have a car but all my days off I Would go to the movies one or two of which were Matthew Broderick movies so yeah I was very familiar with him I as as uh\nI'm a ... I think that um\nAny relationship is it including a relationship between two very famous people as the two of you are a is about like just regular people you know like I've done this job long enough to know that like everybody is a person you know you find a point on it but what people are you know human beings\nAre but at the same time I do like the idea that there was some part of you like the first time you and your husband made out or whatever where you are less just making out with Matthew Broderick ... of course\nYeah I'm never shared that the things that you are you there was so proud of being [noise] um yeah I mean I I ... I thought he was I mean there was a reason I kept paying to see him [noise]\nUm yeah so when we started dating um we met through um friends in the theater he was um brothers and Matthew and\nMatthew best friend founded the theater company called naked angels and I'd be hanging around there and um that's how we met and up\nFor sure part of that was I'd seen that in on a big screen and liked what I saw\nUm\nOr how do you feel about Thomas feeding churches distinctive mustache and the show divorce\n[noise] um I like it very much I'm I'm I'm so glad that\nHe did that because it really has become a the six character on the show [laughter] um [laughter] and um it's been a wonderful conversation on the ... [laughter]\nI ... I since I don't know a whole conversation wheelchair and Oregon on the show when we were in London a couple of months ago she had an extensive conversation about backstage I Am ready to make out with him\n[laughter] like ah I think he looks so heads of wood that moustache me too I think it's so great and it's so and it is also a little bit is both incredibly like dashing and handsome and a little ridiculous\nWilliam and Mary perfect way if it is is that really helps define that character who has those qualities\nYou at ... totally absolutely and I will say one other thing which fits into this idea of when we were in ... for the show and in fact earlier than that I started thinking about\nWhat I Hope this show would look like cinematic ally and and what I wanted the music to look like and the costumes and seventies cinema played\nWas the central ... inspiration from me I mean that's what I kept circling around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and um you know all the great movies in the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play a really important role\nUm but I imagine that that\nMusic was the music as separate young people they fell in love to you know a first kiss um you know skipping school all these things that were um narrated by seventies music and um you know Albert will skiing all the great costume designers and and so this moustache\nWas ... it did so beautifully into those ideas and just glimpses of things that show is not a period piece um but it is we help tell it with music from the seventies and even there are composer I really wanted him to find ways of I'm using the flute\nUm because I felt like it had been ignored for too long and [laughter] I Love the sound and it's so evocative and anybody of a certain ...\nDidn't mean that would have a reaction not just to that obviously to the source music back to that compose music as well so the moustache was this gift because it was it so beautifully fit into these ideas\nWell Sarah Jessica Parker uh I'm I'm Out of time with you but I'm so grateful that uh you came in to talk to us uh I I really appreciate you taking the time\nOh it's been such a treat and you just did not let me down at all and you ask such good smart interesting questions and it's been a real privilege to have time with you and thank you so much [noise]\nSarah Jessica Parker you can currently watching the first two seasons of divorce on HBO Now and HBO Go\nShe's also starring in in producing a new movie called here and now that set to hit theaters November nice [noise]\nIt's ... I'm Jesse for\nMy next guest is Chris gathered Chris was of course the host of the legendary Chris gathered show it aired first on New York city public access television then later on the networks fusion you might have also seen him on broad city or in don't think twice the Mike we're big league improv movie\nChristmas is also a stand up and when we talk you don't really interesting special it's called career suicide it's kind of a one man show gathered produced it would Judd Apatow\nTo genuinely moving special got their talks very specifically about alcoholism about depression even death but he does it in ways that are totally human very identifiable very funny\nOf course has a new book coming out it's called lose well\nAnd it's sort of a self help book he talks about the lessons that he's learned in life shortcomings and successes in show business\nStories of family and friends and there's even a section on his high school band the lesson if you really want to be good at anything you're going to fail and if you want to know the right way to fail Chris gathered has some advice anyway let's take a listen to a little bit from the one man show\nHere he's talking about his early days in show business running from audition to audition to get bit parts in commercials [noise]\nGet accurate I start getting acting work I'm getting most of the commercials mostly commercials if you start to ... to to this day you go deep enough of the search results you can still find it very annoying commercial for H R Block where I where later I was [noise]\nI wanted to audition for a subway sandwich commercial to play the role all man who is on attracted to women [noise]\nThat character named ... [noise] I couldn't even call them die or something [noise]\nI didn't book that part I'm assuming because [noise]\nChris gathered welcome back to bowl but it's good to see a great to see you too so your new special or one man show or whatever you want to call it was called career suicide it's largely about your mental health do you feel exhausted by talking\nAbout here [laughter] you know what I mean one hundred percent yeah one of the great things about the special coming out is that maybe I can talk about I can stop [laughter] every thing I have to say about it is in that special and when I get asked about it I can just\nTell people you know find it out all your uh HBO driven streaming platform for this story 'cause that's really what I have to say about it\nUm 'cause it had been many years of talking about it in some form or another and definitely it's exhausting and doing the show more exhausting than I thought for sure it feels like part of\nIn the special and also in your memoir which was the last time you're on the show I think is in writing about it I mean performing about it you are talking yourself into engaging with it fully\nYeah I think that's a very astute observation I think there's like definitely a part of me that knows that if it's not hidden it has less power over me if it's not something I'm trying to\nYou're listening to ... I'm Jesse Thorn my guest Chris ... is a comedian and the star of the one man show career suicide which is washable now on HBO he's also the author of the new book lose well which book stores October sixteenth we talked last year what are the things you\nTalk about in your special show for suicide is the extent to which you had linked to your emotional health to\nYour career this presumption that if your career was successful that you would be emotionally healthy because of that\nYeah um two part question do you feel differently about that now are you able to feel differently about that the second part is\nDo you think you would feel comfortable doing work in your career that was good work but not capital G. capital W good works you know what I mean like just if you were like\nIf you got cast on as a second guy in a funny sitcoms\nYeah and the sitcom was an evil but neither was it a place for teenagers can come out right\nRight it was it wasn't A Guided by this sense of urgency or or\nThe chip on his shoulder that my work clearly has now at like ... I'm definitely a workaholic its problems\nIt's probably like one of the biggest things are still wrap my head around is that I get caught too caught up in career stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go tomorrow which could getting better about that you know have a little bit more stability and I've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but it still is this thing I have to remind myself of ... I always had this feeling of like a you know like if if I can just get one of those big jobs everybody have to notice it and\nI have to admit that I was right going for this and they'll have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would to accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of a cop to the fact is\nThat it's there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants witnessed that asked cat New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member and after now talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent on the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressing so hard man I don't know what's going on and we're going to get\nWith my next gig ... might have to move across the country and there are so stressed and I was like man I always figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy you're in the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back 'cause you've proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out\nI have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do 'cause getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems as far as I could I you know could I settled in and really enjoy it if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square some of the er standard you could say\nSome of the stuff I've done\nI don't know like I mean you could be for\nYou could be the next thirty rock throwing rocks the funniest show\nGreat shows more funding if in that show than there isn't but if I'm not about\nIt's not about much more than being in front of every it's about some other yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride one of my favorite shows of all time course but it doesn't have that fire and it's got trying to prove some [laughter] it doesn't have the mission statement of trying to like break the system and sneak in the back to\nI feel like I probably could I imagine you know I I think hard about it because there's all there's a part of me that's also like if something like that were to happen like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that I tried at this point you know doubting ... or my\nIndie credibility at this point like I think anyone who knows my work would say that guy spent years\nBending over backwards to try to do this thing and that time he was the only one who knew why he kept going at times I had visibly quit and other people fans rather be working on the show convince me to keep going so there's a part of me that's like at a certain point\nI've done my part and maybe I couldn't move on and just do something I uh ... sure I'd find some side project very quickly to um push the buttons that\nFuel out of my my ... one of the things that makes me want to keep up accomplishing stuff is you know you see people in this industry who eventually get to a point where they can produce other people's work\nAnd I'm not quite there yet but I Would love to be because I I feel like one of the things that I have going right now is I remember what it was like for me seven eight nine ten years ago when nobody\nWas particularly interested in I had to just like kicked out some doors and make it happen for myself\nCourt in that spot and help them not to have to spend half a decade on public access TV to make it happen so that's another thing is like maybe if I was to get one of those bigger jobs\nThat could give me that credibility that could bring some other stuff into the world's but who knows I don't know I'll sell out some day everybody to us right [noise]\nIt's bull's eye I'm Jesse Thorn I'm Talking with a comedian Chris gathered about his special career suicide you can watch it on HBO Now\nFriend of mine was telling me this past week it has a friend who sold the company for sixty five million dollars and he said this to me as a kind of warning for my friends told his company for sixty five million dollars not only does is make bad art\nAnd I was like a dream make bad art yeah I'm In that's already make it better than had been doing for years [laughter] yeah [laughter] not really getting paid that well for him yeah certainly don't have sixty five million dollars [laughter] I don't have to find a market for my bad ours that's perfect\nYeah it is funny they're talking about the idea of moving on its you know the gathered show when I talk about the gathered show for years that has been my people and they're still my people\nTheir punk kids they're weirdos they're artists\nA lot of them are clear a lot of them are doing things their own way you know a lot of them either by choice or by necessity or people who have walked their own path and they find this and it's like oh this is a community of people lost their I'll bet it's a beautiful thing I'm very very proud of it those are my people but it's funny\nThey are so why is that like\nI get the sense\nOnline sometimes I'm really in tune with these people this past week I was in a fight with my own thing club I might they banned they shut they stopped comments on my post and the Facebook group that's my fan club the get the ads and I was obviously mad about it and they were like we don't care where shutting down like I have this contentious relationship\nAnd I get that that sometimes that like\nThey are such underground people and so passionate about the values of that\nDebt me being in my ... movie is a little bit of a sellout [laughter] beautiful anonymous pod a pod cast they're like you're getting a little too mainstream press buddy and there's almost like a counter cultural element to the gathered show\nWhere I have to grow and I have to evolve\nAnd I'm In ... it's a very fascinating thing to realize I don't know if they want me to and that's a very odd feeling very odd feeling I can steal them being happy for me but I can also feel can feel a lot of my older school fans feeling like man like he's really\nHe's really growing up and moving on and I don't know exactly how to handle that 'cause I feel like that's what I've always been working towards is trying to get a better head on my shoulders it's weird I don't know how to go\nI'm heading you know especially thinking about H. B. O. like that's a more a bigger platform than I've ever had\nYour ... name before you're yeah so the copier credit\nPretty fancy stuff how much longer can I claim to be this rebel tried to ah throw rocks from the outside the house you know I don't know how much longer people are going to buy that but I don't really know what else I Am\nAre you worried that you're not going to get get the Tonight Show and you're going to have to move to CBS andme enlarge the band\nOh my God that was your bigger theatre and follow that man's life I Would be very often\nI don't know I just read a biography of Batman his lifetime that horrible ... I can only talk about what I what I witnessed as a consumer of pop culture yeah they're ready to the junior senator yeah most brilliant\nUm [laughter] kids are the same thrilled about now are the things we read about the actual um loneliness that she doesn't seem great but I I think a lot of that if he would be proud of the crews gathered show that's like a major concern of mine is like if footage of this ever went across David Letterman's desk\nWould he be psyched because in my mind\nA lot of what's behind it is\nNot talking bad about anybody but late night just used to be a lot weirder I think it just used to be weirder he was weird cone instills weird even Carson had a lot of weird stuff on there\nUsed to be the element to it where it would get a little chaotic unpredictable\nAnd now in my opinion seems much more controlled and that's okay but I Want my show it to be an hour of just that\nLetterman you sometimes just like get a permit to shut down the block so he could pour ten thousand rubber balls off the roof of his duty onto the street and that was no thought about it beyond that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bullseye with Jesse Thorn", "city": "Keene", "day": "14"}
