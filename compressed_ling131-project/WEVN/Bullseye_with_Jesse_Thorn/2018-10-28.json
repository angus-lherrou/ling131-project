found the downs and saying [noise]\nEric Idle welcome to both I'm so happy to have you on the show thank you for having me you recorded the vote ... under a blanket hotel room I was just thinking of that I live in a hotel bedroom in Tunisia and second\nRight her child too and the and the sound recording ... um yeah because I wanted to change the way I sang the lyric 'cause we were wrong we were on location filming the life of Brian forty years ago actually and uh\nI just saw or should be the character I'm playing ... it ... and the the demo I'd done was really rather boring always look on the bus you know it was kind of boring boring boring vocal shot so that's where I should do start to ...\nWhich is this rocket fuel ... bit of it and then we just hit it live and I live from a hotel bedroom in Tunisia\nThat song in ... in our ways of sort of a framing device ... for the book and I had never thought of it in terms of it being a like a solution to the problem the problem being if you're going to make a comedy about Jesus he's going to be crucified [laughter] well yeah\nIt's a show with thousands of other people you know it's a road when it was the Roman method of execution\nSo you have to come up with somebody if you know that your film and you know obviously life of Brian is Jesus adjacent uh but if\nYou know you're going to end your film ... ... if you can't end it with a wedding like most comedy right it can be A Midsummer Night's Dream or whatever [laughter] so I\nAll of the characters were heading for a lot of them were heading for execution and that was a problem we have to do what the hell are we going to do that we can render stamp thing\nLeast coming in and arresting everybody which my daughter says is the worst ending of film\nAnywhere is a very very bad and the vet but maybe my favorite movie of all time record in terrible at it [laughter]\nSo um we were trying to think of what to do it and I I just said well we should end with a song you know she'll be like a cheery ... you know a lot but looking on the bright side because it's it's terribly ironic to call and I should look on the bright side when you are being crucified there's not a lot to look forward to [laughter] so it is a sort of ...\nOptimism in in the context of the movie but seems to be ... did it for reality just got nice\nTo talk about beginnings for a second I didn't know much about the circumstances of your early life can you tell me about how you came to ship off to boarding school fulltime\nUm well I was I Wish I was born in in in World War two and a [noise]\nUh the end of World War two Ninety five my father was during the ... been since Nineteen forty one and they told everybody hitchhike home for for the holidays and\nHe got a ride and he was in the truck which rubbed off the road and load crushed him and he actually died in hospital on Christmas Eve which is a kind of supporting it seemed running but\nUm I was only two and a half so it's not something that I experienced afterwards and through the absence of my mother's in extraordinary grief in reaction to that I think she disappeared into a depression for a while\nUm and then you know she she uh she got back [laughter] that one that I I think I went to school in the other side of the ... the opposite livable 'em and while the sea and then\nIt was too much I Know I was about seven and an unruly

I'm Jesse Thor and my guest Eric Idle is a founding member of money python you start and movies like the holy grail and the life of Brian in so many more he's got a new book out it's called always look on the bright side of life a sorta biography um when\nYou write a memoir ... one of the things that you have to deal with is the important people in your life who you are I'm remembering after they're passing was that a difficult part of writing the book\nIt was it was the hardest part I realized I mean I what I did this I sent out to write the story and I didn't want to go to a publisher I Want us to just write a book that I wanted to writes how I wanted to write to us on just let's see what it what happens why does he go to what subjects do I find [noise]\nAnd then off to bed I realized that I had been avoiding dealing with some people I knew who recently passed and I particularly Robin I haven't face the fact that I really didn't believe he was dead it totally and I owed it to him to write about him because I've known him since Nineteen eighty and we've been very close\nUm to write something about him and says thanks fresh wants to kind of an extraordinary person he was and so that was sort of hard to do\nBut that was that's the discipline of when you come back to a thing you try and put some shape into it and what it needs what's missing ... can you put into the cake you know that make it make it better as a book\nWhen you did that when you engaged with I mean Robin Williams was one of the people [noise] George Harrison is whether folks that you write about um Graham Chapman although Chapman has you know we've covered in many more python centric things in the book [noise] um\nYeah how ... how do you feel differently about they're passing as a you know as a guy in his mid seventies like as a person who has a lot to retrospect about\nWhat you look around and suddenly all the people I found really funny and really great for going to dinner or gone Garry Shandling all Carrie Fisher um might Nicole ... you know they they you know and that's something that is oh I get it so ... wait so the death thing that that doesn't apply then okay\nUm and you know I think the fact is that it just it behooves you to realize and put things into perspective and then you know I like to encourage young people um and just\nYou know to to write about people I Want you to write about I was like I'm\nMost looking straight she broke eminent Victorians these an ambulance Elizabethan but uh I I I liked the idea of writing about ... says people who who you knew or have some insight into I think that's that's interesting for people and it's also interesting for me to write about\nIs the fiftieth anniversary of python coming up and you've done what you just say well be your\nLast shows [laughter] um and you know you just wrote your memoir like you're in you're in looking back mode right do you still look forward to to still make the kinds of plants that you made ten years ago or Twenty years ago or fifty years ago\nI mainly on just read the books and [laughter] they're like a child you know [laughter] but um we can't do it again because sadly Terry Jones is not able to do it again and then so that's just a few of us left able and it wouldn't be the same I think we did a big show in a big fat well we're\nBus leaves but um it will be certainly not a particularly performing it will be encouraging other things to take place I think that's the best I can express it's um [noise] you know the ... fifty it's it's not our anniversary as somebody asked his wedding anniversary [laughter] it's it's a very strange one but\nI thought I Would write my book because when you want to be honest questions so I wanted to see what I could remember while I still haven't forgotten\nDo you think of it all differently now than you did Twenty years ago or even like I'm Talking about after the movies were made and so on and so forth but still a long time ago\nA very long time ago and it it just it's amazing to me because it just seems to get ... I mean it doesn't seem to ... becomes more ... in the end you just you know well what can you do\nYou embrace it enjoy it and be grateful for all those wonderful people that you met along the way and all the many laugh we were doing comedy so we have those on a bloody laptops and that's really writes\nEric I'm so grateful that you came here to be a ball that it's real honor to have you on that show and\nThank you for that and ... thanks for your amazing work that's meant so much to me in so many people sure my pleasure thank you for reading the book [laughter] I did it it's true\n[noise] Eric\nIdle a real life mighty python member his new book always look on the bright side of life is in bookstores now you can go check it out I I mean\nWhat can I recommend to you from ... the greatest comedy group the English language has ever known but I Will say one of my favorite little Eric Idle performance is is it a sketch called the ... brothers I'm sure you can find it now that ball pythons on Netflix and\nI'm sure you can find it on Web sites that play videos too but uh yeah just Google the ... brothers and you'll be glad you did\n[noise]\nIt's ...
