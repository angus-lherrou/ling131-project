I'm\nRobert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal case\nThis case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSearching Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalism newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand and he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up\nAnd about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw for the middle aged men peering into the\nTent who looked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again I'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some ropes basically he had he had each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after you had the four people tied\nHe went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski on\nBecause the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening\nBut they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with boys\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to them\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing ... with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times and the cat\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter than our men come\nMen that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nOf a sudden they spotted than a killer and Freeman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun is going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and Cooley walked into the forest and not speak in what was at the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see\nWhen the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a ... patrols\nMen armed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling and trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the words\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID the\nThirty seven year old Robert De Niro Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict\nHe'd been in prison for rape served seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC and so by Tuesday night when the people got panicked when you're all are well one of the\nDoors are large people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and we've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast let them figure it out last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers says a man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men or\nThe police follow elite that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Guerra\nDeep freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and scare started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back the arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not\nMoving and so they thought he might be dead\nBecause he was just laying there but they took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're really in the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that this story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor at least ... and again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do\nIn the situation okay and we are recording it so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrank age aren't many Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and so they they use that money but it is or money [noise]\nCouple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think this at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here\nAnd he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I liked ... fights physical fights I'd like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting this date and ...\nAnd he was doing really well he has well respected had a good reputation\nBut then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah black you're strong man to take him out you need a forty five and a a juice had that feeling of this guy is dangers a love of things are going to happen\nThis is the year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things wind won\nA schoolteacher headless cells to his child he was sued the school\nAnd I talk to him out of it and then he had an automobile accident I represent them on that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\nSo eventually they pull over get on it\nWhen a new one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise]\nTook of driving that lady friends car to try to lose any too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nThis may be as far as we can walk\nUp to the old abandoned mine\n[noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren McCain straight and the town's advisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father\nSo that some a road that goes to the miners are what is your after the minds it was that sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a trail of her own or you're just because I'm very icy that day\nThis hair this used to be an old roadway [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly teeth are no leaves and all the trees were black and I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in here so\nRight up there so here we are in our son do suits in every ... choose for is looking for [noise]\nSpent another ... hours look [noise]\nWe found this for her to allow you\nSee the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak shoe and blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself this the bitch does it\nEnd he yells back up to Belgium get me out of your\nNew my backup do\nEventually bell gee found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her\nBut our money wasn't there when delta G founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took you know to keep the confidence is over ...\nThe current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client is under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody\nDeath or a substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if the\nPeople are already dead than you do the law is ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a ... year building on on the side of tell just tell tale\nOf course soon I knew Mr hulk from bowling [noise] to his his du da other ... daughter were in the same class and I knew him from church and\nWanting to be a minimum a few ... the parents of the family and then you had to have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\n[noise] so now what does she [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise] we'll be right back

I'm I'm rods I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a\nNo brainer what is it what's their next move well so they decided to put the burden plea bargain they take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her a moon you're going to take a little well that's kinda gross you know\nYeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police detective McCabe and the district attorney arm in his office and when they met ... search the briefcase was up to be a and the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian present the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed the [noise]\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer do do do the job [noise]\nUh I mean I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if you will face\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp [noise] um I agree um his duty is to his client who represents his client's best interest if you and in sitting in on these\nClasses and in talking to law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation\nThis is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nTo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with\nA family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on a phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing machines camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and build you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with it\nSomething that you knew the law schools are teaching and and if you had any dealings with also about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nIn the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a totally lie a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professor of law students there um when they approached this is it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling\nWith the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um\nBut you have a chance to communicate some of that experience yeah well\nIt's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm Still\nI I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because it'll never go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering ... we've been talking a lot of um substance I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do the news is that you would want people to know\nYou want to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\n[noise] [noise] what can I say she was she did receive her degree pass to mostly [laughter]\nPick it up to Boston University\nToo difficult for us and Danny what's your boyfriend had just that summer and he had a full scholarship and graduated just before too\nAnd I'm sure other children have\nGreat future I had a true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\n\nIt's it's a horrible you know to be in a position\nTo have to live [laughter] I mean how how do you really lose your your daughter you know what what excuses for protecting the person to kill her\nNo justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's the way it is [noise]\nUm I'm gonna get just a minute of silence up here if that's OK\n\n\n\nOkay can you hear the\nEchoes of dogs tonight and things tend to travel up the\nHill kind of bounce around um water I think it's\nSo deep down in their ... and I can't tell whereas stripping everything up here it's frozen solid sounds what that is [noise]", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year":
