story comes to us from producers Simon ... so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please\n[noise]\n\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh sunny Saturday morning a this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [noise]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that\nRight there are you guys\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie newer\nAnd what what are you calling in\nNursing has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but\nTo say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shots Facebook triggered hordes now in what would become a loud Facebook do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say\nBond is like ... to ... we can see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\nThank\nDo you subjectively prioritize or censor speech\nCongresswoman or we don't even\nThink about what we're doing is censoring speech but there are types\nWhat what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook that digital document it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and diet\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow\nWhich made me wonder like what are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back or on that morning in two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference\nRoom trying to figure out what to do I'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch to just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nAnd now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so at the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind\nThis isn't nearly two thousands seismic changes this week and the Internet hiring ... this was like the deep dark path nice face time is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of\nTen million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things that come up onto their screen flagged ... to Facebook and on Lake meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were seeing was either [noise] naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd Everytime something popped up on the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any Senate written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one ...\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[laughter] right\nNow a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but\nAccording to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically\nEnough through Facebook so to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nAnd then changed their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and they caught on the social networking website is under fire for any policy on photos of women brand new meeting their shelter I taught him\nTwelve thousand members participated in the media requests started pouring in a bad thing is I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington\nPost so the Internet is an interesting Dr phil [noise] it was a media storm and\nEventually perhaps as a result of our group and our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nSent them there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of ...\nWow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like [noise]\nWell I'm originally from now we\nFound out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nSo there's a lot of reading I mean happening\nAnd not certain about the good work and [laughter] this is my third one of these you\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like in India that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I was going to end victory I don't want to leave their\nCheeks plain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nLike ... are headed to prohibit any ... about ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be game uh at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which if your Facebook you might want\nYou know I I signed up to monitor graphic images just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I yeah I tell you got ... so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he'd show up to his desk every morning put on his head phones [laughter]\nIgnore ...\n... I just I guess like a forty five ... every day it was just at lunch and decisions and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\nWell if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like ... or it's too I think the ...

don't want to hear this kind of thing to do with their kids in the room might wanna sit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe and ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty rich right\nHey Rhonda Maryland but sorry but to make it up thank you I mean some break we have some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carl\nMonday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bomb [noise]\nThrough the crowd

faces Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ...\nMeanwhile similar CBS studio on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise] Facebook employees\nWere clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news ... and\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage shelling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published\nOn line and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly [noise]\nSort of going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together and sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy\nEssentially this photos being posted everywhere else it's important\nWe need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can\nPull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sent down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so I mean yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher where would they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\n... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrap book\nSquare where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now a news organization friends' parents\nDo you get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently infected even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook\nWhich are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest\nPublisher center this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and responsible for your content which makes a of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations\nHowever were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside\nWhat ... what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ...\nHe'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or\nThat happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera and then a man with his face covered\nGrabs her head pulled her head back and slices\nHer head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times I just reading my Twitter feed had been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "20"}
