Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in him or things are pretty startling levy because of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class one day I came across this poem\nA tiny little about the kind of sat right in the middle of the page like a long\nStint sausage vertical a\nSyllables per line to super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that I still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card written by this guy clemen Murrow who was a poet nearly Fifteen hundred sat\nThe court of queen\nAnd he wrote the pound for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and she'd gotten sick flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first yeah okay it's called\nA ... done was that in my lab to a sick demos though so to speak for king lady of the young lady\n... young a group who doesn't look boom through Lucy's you'll see peaceful guinea who ... to beat them all ... to\n... see onto the tub boost use of ... to ... to ... ... ... ... ... ...\nOh my God it must have gotten so many chicks and you're right it was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so you read suppose files it away deep in the corner of his mind fast forward about Twenty years he publishes his for [noise]\nThey become very popular in the publisher decided to have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day\nThat home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is that what is the challenge okay what\nI meant was to set we\nHere's the thing he says he got this home\nMommy none of us who doesn't look\nIf you just focus on the words of basically just this guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like ... I ... wish you to open your doors and get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam goofy too so you don't look so pale about Andrew lose you're plump shape the elderly or you know sort of like get better here's to your good health\n... to dwell on the bone I mean young but just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ... the\nTone the light hearted and us and and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form it's wonderfully catchy little ...\n... rhyme you know a B. B. C. C. D. D. and uh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems they've known to Vermont oh and I did I say three syllables per lawyer didn't ya ya or as\nThree syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this pump along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast sea onto the tub Bush keeps of like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting there in the dead of squirming in ... that have slurping sloppy and instead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my ...\nMy sweet dear I send cheer all the best you're forced rest\nDislike jail so don't ale very long just gets strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you are a ... for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health be near my sweet deer\nShow claim all his now Douglas Clinton all became Douglas and I I like the other ones don't jam became bread though the bread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words\nBut the words represent concept and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly\nTalking about bread and things that you spread it on oh ... some people would\nJust stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent them home to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nOddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob can you do it and a Bob Said well\nGive it a try fairest friend let me send my embrace quit\nThis place it's dark halls and bank\nIn soft still regain health\nDress and fleet off with Clement who calls for\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous he\nGot the pale face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient Rome but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number for this just two lines though no no no no no claim on the whole road at three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was the form that's what made the thing funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nail the form he ended up sending the palm out to like sixty people\nStudents who my sweet I and treat one regard\nWho's colleagues friends chicken D.

I just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs so that hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise book Carlin's real point was that it it like Dole's\nOur reactions to it that actually have like a kind of a negative effect and it gets worse with every generation has a whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST no he goes so goes it's in four different things\nIn the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... language two syllables shell shocked\nAnd then it became battle fatigue battle fatigue for syllables now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhausted [noise]\nHey we're up to eight syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder still a syllabus but we had a high\nAnd then it became peachy as\nPost traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis was the or will notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blended out the words so if you stop saying now yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some for some interrogation\nWhen I saw people living\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom and sent me showing her wearing the device and\nWalking down the street told me they usually\nYou know now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially uptown where the shelter lot wider\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her so I uh [noise]\nI hardly ever notice and if people walking around me it feels like [noise]\nLocking tales our\nEconomic chair of the ... and it sounds a tactic but not as if he for\nWhich he says we split the device on and put a sensor on her tongue [noise] the sidewalk when [noise]\nCame alive I thought it was amazing like I didn't know this many people around the street at the same time as they have now they're um [noise] down there again which you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting like\nReally stopped a chance in everything that stops nice soft rock she says you\nCan move [noise]\nThere is to walk and I can see their last living and I can see them again [noise] but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see these teachers or\nWhether they're wearing a shirt or a short sirt address or pads age just like see their shot at it\nAnd every now and I see the light pass it on and really yeah\nI've mentioned smell like underwater creatures\nUh-huh squishy jellyfish like yeah\nYeah like lady yeah yeah like that [laughter]\n\n\nIn that friendly is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue New York city becomes is a cheesy sea of walking fish that make their way along in the sunshine [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a video of Emily painting while using the brain port or you can check that out by going to radio abducted word\nNo oh\n\nMy God\n\n\nThis is Frank Gilmore calling from Reno nevada\nPresenting future at heart a new podcast that explores the work of change makers across the country and highlights projects in cities like Miami Washington DC and New York city in the future at heart and available on apple part cat or wherever podcasts are found [noise]\nThis is Jessica from Boston radiolab is supported by progressive insurance committed to providing efficient tools to enable customers to bundle home and auto insurance learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progress at\n\nAT T forty four this is New Hampshire public radio [noise]\nHey there is Joshua Johnson the host of one day on any PR were bringing the show to New Hampshire can't wait for you to join the conversation I lead a distinguished panel of gifts through a special discussion about issues that matter to you and to the granted they\nWill be at the Capitol Center for the arts in Concord on Thursday get your tickets right now at the C.

C. N. G. that's it\nBut he's the problems he like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy team piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated like out of this for simple base has become the assets that become hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nHow do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved\nAnd the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ... this is a code problem [noise]\n... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need\nTo think of a of a clever way of [noise]\nYou know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Duke it keeps it keeps going and then out comes the protein the what\nWhat simple code could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out to side I think\nThat ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\n[noise] like instead of eighty CGI ac ... thought maybe it's a TA CGI DCA a C. A. G. A. T.\nT. in other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triple not pairs because if you have sets of three or rather than to the game I figured well that give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins yup\nNow this is just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick and a group of other scientists worked it all out they they figured out how you get from physically get from DNA into proteins here's how it works and sort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "13"}
