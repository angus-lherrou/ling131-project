R. dot org\n\nBefore we start today's episode will be much to know this broadcast contains tape that describe violent events some there's some profane language that we'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be forewarned wait you think\n\nYou're listening to radio lab\nRadio around WWE and why [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... Barton Robert Krulwich radiolab and today [noise]\nThey're gonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times\nWe've had on the show before then say something high [laughter] [laughter] okay good alright where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national story [noise] there was a lot of belly a king and the press how many people do see killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch\nFire and they arrive Jason Harris than double John Ritter and will\nBecome sort of a national story and I personally was having trouble and processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody attracts these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere within the police department itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented Brazil\nBurst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and so of course then sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears or so paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now\nThis involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved is is a massive saying that involve probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThings that have been put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many accidents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages so I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we've got um broken\nDown by county but you can see a\nShow a or B county\nBoca Raton Boivin beach uh all\nThe alphabet and you basically just has a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire day\nUse of force reports civil court records and media clippings they represent\nA eight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and and six years time two thousand nine to two dozen fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an arm stuff's pact or chase [noise] all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people are hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions lessens some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agencies keeps track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos that go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem\nThe numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like in the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that\nPeople who cover police apparently know quite well\nYou know the news briefs that you see\nOnce or twice a week but it was news to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country [noise] but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and this was that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talked with in the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally\nDown Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six kind of person he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah I mean [noise] I mean what\nGets me is like the I don't know\nIt's back to where we were in why we want to start this nasty nasty still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know I mean they're all written in this uh supplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew salary received a call ... ... to Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five is confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife a department too far but every one of these every report because at least one human life if someone was either you know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nUh so we have on this table the the ... death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one people\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nTo get into ... brown\nUs is reaching out wherever insightful vein something happened in you know here in Florida where we're going to be done\nAnd then we're going to end\nThen nobody really wants to be\nCrazy but his family more than just\nAnd I could not have\nFilming by doing anything [noise]\nMhm so after the event ended at the community center crystal took a bunch of the Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or you know just wanted to know this was\nIt has been telling everyone about them\n... says her son Andrew died in ... fourteen\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but it it must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping dream right you're right we're all just simply trying\nOur way is a critical\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew when I go through my house she says his age comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMidsize one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and cousins were in the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them or their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n[noise]\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\nThere was some earth wind and fire [noise]\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is talk of Clinton's we start to stay over eight inches of houses\nWe see each other bad on the couch you know a air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the policy for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some sort of shows resources like therapy for\nFigures let me pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that\nReally stuck with me to believe or add a sex Marlon problems to\nAnd it was when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlene was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people him and about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nWe usually the video that just came out on video streaming my\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came and he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetable garden has\nWing and all that but I I Am then 'cause I'm when a when you know when they took him away in released and sit down and type of stuff we came back here is all you can smell\nSupport for an HP arts live stream

to me a couple of women handed me the phone my ... like this don't do it\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face at three to one\nThree two one\nLet me all started walking back to put the cars [noise]\nSharing with us because I Know [noise]\nWe we haven't been I have a law it's been a while\nIt was up to the great fight we saw that once a week [noise] and I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember at the end I used to tell you how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's greatest about Fifteen minutes\nOf their visit home I have to go there all the time of course yeah of course how could you not [noise]\nAnd you know what you like you want to go sit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's great you can go about yeah like a certain time every\nDay and it's this little white man we share everything was set up like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nI don't know if you're a Democrat in all of that is a little white guy that always sit down\nHe take his chair I Can't hold I Would I Know [noise]\n\n[noise] so the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can either repeal who was the mother Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother I watched\nWas loaded into the ...\nAnd it was around this time that a few of these women started called themselves the mothers movement [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in D.

International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against these guiding principles basically saying that being the top is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have ... have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are\nPossibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly right but\nCumulatively it does I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like\nReason for hope right and that sort of felt the same way too but [noise]\nThere was this experience than I had registered realized\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay tuned [noise]\nThis is Ryan ... calling from stover Mont radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation to ... public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about Sloan WWW dot Sloan or gee\nThis is Jeff times from Rockville, Maryland radiolab supported by targeting present in future at heart and\nI guess on change makers and the projects that championing in communities nationwide nutrient hard ... album part gas wherever broadcast around [noise]\nYou're listening to an HP are more than sixteen hundred listener supported NHCD our during our recent fund drive\nYour contributions prove that you value the news\nInformation in entertainment you find on the station thank you thank you thank you thank you for your support together we see this community service and vibrant and down the bill for everyone\nIf you haven't had a chance to contribute there's still time to support your local and national journalists keep an HP are strong for you and future generations today at any PR dot org\nAnd support for an H.
