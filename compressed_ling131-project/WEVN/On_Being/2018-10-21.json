[noise]\n\nIn a strangers and they're on land um take up what you call it ... the whole issue um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamics anytime the great paradox and um [noise]\nYou know you point at this dynamic that in the\nPart of the country you're in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and ... great pollution and great really resistance to regulating polluters and I I think that's such an example of where [noise]\nFrom the outside of all the dynamics that go into that\nWould say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a there's a background I think right\nUm partly I think people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the federal government was a bigger better\nVersion of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out of the state government has not protected people okay\nFrom pollution [noise] you know there's a there's this pathogen in the book that I thought and strangers in their own land that I\nI just just just as an example of this and maybe this person you're talking about you know Harold ... the state yeah always seems to come down on the little guy he no he says his take this by you if your motor boat leaks little gas into the water the war no right you up but if companies like thousands of gallons of it\nAnd kill all the life here the state lets them go\nAt right now that example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are are so rich and powerful that and say basically have a bond [laughter] the legislature and that there was that the companies have outsourced the moral charity work to the state\nSo they say oh pay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developed let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives them in it for\nIt I think it was one point six billion dollars that uh was in the last five years in Louisiana offered to companies yeah to come in\nWith that public money now which came from Texas [laughter] I'm\nHis aides and can make donations to the autumn on society or for new football uniforms\nFor outlets you ... you know looking good and setting up third grade classes in chemistry meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits a [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed like candy so the state looks terrible the company it looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you can say to get you to feel like the company is your friend to feel like the state does your enemy\n[noise] yeah and there's ... you also describe [noise]\nThis interesting dynamic that um that again is is new want it's not something that would be obvious anybody on a lot of this is true but I mean for example you um\nYou you have this chapter called there are members\n... and there's something where you you this is just amazing ... about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power\nAnd then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory cell in part to respectful clerks and federal offices internal environmentalists\nSo much complexity there\nYeah [laughter] sure heart does mine yes oh yeah yeah\nBecause the people I came to know are no more about the environment\n... fish are in what area where you had the crab pots where you know what ducks you can shoot at what period of of the year\nThey love their land and yet and yet they're they're ... I mean people work in the plants and I talked to a woman who said\nYou know I asked you do talk to your neighbors about ah the environment she said you know our neighbors working plants and uh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused yeah\nYou know as if the people working in the plants would take on the guilt right or is that go along with it you know and it is it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it's a the absence of\nA regulation here their rules here right you're right like California is very strict rules we enjoy it cleaner environment as a result it's at that level the guilt it's not a personal one right so that was very poignant and sweet I've heard to be mindful that\nYou know an operator might feel with ...\n[noise] yeah [noise] and scan like poignant this whole thing gets it as well and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here and we made we made it does make things messy right but again I you know I just feel like you are for this is saying let's let's deal with reality\nNot wishful thinking\nAnd let's talk about reality and not wishful thinking by having a simple a respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is is bullying conversational anybody else you know new year coming together\nTo see if there can be common ground on the environment\nAnd there can be I think the\nPeople I came to know we're very interested and very proving of\nRenewables in fact there's something called the green tea moved from the Tea Party that's all for renewables\nBut we're not even finding common ground because we weren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our bubble still in fact I I think that problem remains with us and especially on the left I think uh\nThere's a kind of a rigid in a sort of in for turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out\nLooking for potential common ground\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAfter a short break more with our Lee ...\nWe're putting all kinds of great extras into my pod cast feet poetry music and a new feature living that question\nGet it all as soon as this release twenty subscribed on

you barrel on in there and ignore the competence and [noise] uh\nIdentities person in the last two yeah just counterproductive it is counterproductive\nAnd I sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nYou know any point right that might be made I Want to say you know do you want to be right in every moment you know or do you want to be part of the larger healing\n[noise] that's right that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help build a a public conversation about the big issues that day and Law Order to do that\nYou have to really be good at a emotion management [laughter] you know make it it it's a contribution to the larger whole to be really good\nAnd bad [noise] um [noise]\nI'm Krista Tibetan dishes on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion hardly hawk shield [noise]\nNot a poignant things I felt and throughout strangers in their own land and this time you've spent\nSienna is and it's a Bible belts right and one of the things you found which I think is an interesting critique for you know the more the site that considers itself to be an lightened is um [noise] uh\nThat regulation that a lot of the things that are coming at people that's what needs to be done in fact is not about\n... herring like not about how do we whole I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made a lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense than the government [laughter]\nMhm sold out so question okay what has the government done phew let's\nYou know maybe they will point may be a it hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed for things that didn't do okay let's figure that out let's have a right back for public conversation about just that [noise]\nIt is the ... the government kind of um [noise]\nIn fact letting people down you know or they expecting too much of it what's the record so oh let's let's talk about that and the specifics yeah yeah\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just listed you say even among the most ardent an extreme I mean I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met over five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there is potential for a coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for nonviolent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure\nUm so interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise]\nRight [laughter] wherever I'm hanging fruit right yeah mhm yeah\nThat's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm\n[noise] you I'm and I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to Louisiana friends on ours you'd say ... you know if if you imagine if I if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to your friends on the liberal left I was just it kind of humanizing and its provocative and a human way consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience and what if you\nGrew up in a family um it's so many said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know [noise]\nUm okay what if that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know and what if it was the blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job\nNo [noise] I think that there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or two people with different political views I went to a different social class and there is a lot\nUh at the blue collar class that lived there serious look we're the daily workers we're climbing the telephone pole to repair or telephone wire or re paving roads where [noise]\nWho are you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year and a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of old cocoon I've long in here\nAs I Am and a kind of you know it's not only a contempt that really bothers me whenever I hear it or see it um\nAnd that is buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out it's as if on the left there's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them\nOr we need our sturdy coalitions and I think labor unions when the labor movement was much larger and and [noise] there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft right right with different colors yeah\nIn in classes got together natural way Tennessee theory on each other they we're here yes public school system is um but we're down on those\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year acquired of every one\nOf every one where have you know yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different reach and get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go cross a to see if we can rebuild does that connective tissue yeah\nI'm I'm sure people have said to you and I I I can into this conversation myself that um\n[noise] there's critique that you know [laughter] they're all kinds of groups of people including like people of color um who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country and they ran this late right and I am right now yeah yes and especially now yet again and\nIt's when white people\nThat you know the critiques that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people um\nHow do you have you work with that in your mind\nIt's true and I think it's a it's an important insight [noise] yes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example the opiate\nAddiction problem has has been oh now they're called a diseases of despair\nAnd ... which is kind of a compassionate way crack epidemic with
