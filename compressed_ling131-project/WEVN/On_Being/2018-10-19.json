oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over not at all not at all ... it just means being emotionally intelligent ... that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help\nBuild a public conversation about the big issues of the day you have to really be good at and emotion management [laughter]\nYou know it's a contribution to the larger whole to be really good at bat I'm Christian ... and this is on being\n[noise]\nStrangers in their own man with a finalist for the national Book Award early hawk shield is a professor emeritus at at Berkeley and was born in Boston, Massachusetts so you were the child of a foreign service officer you sound like you grow up all over the world\nYeah [noise] I ah lived in Israel\nAnd uh from age uh twelve to fourteen very pivotal experience and then I'm New Zealand willing to New Zealand and then my folks were in Guyana and I spent a summer\nAnd gone up but by then I was in college and then they weren't Tunisia so I was very\nFortunate really to get to experience that yeah oh yeah\nWas there I'm a religious or spiritual background to your childhood I'm In your family are in those places\nYeah I Would say um my parents were a very religious Unitarian so and uh for you Terry inside the message I took away is that it's a very big world and we have to learn to\nUh get to know and empathize with and you know people in radically different cultures\nI think by the time I was sixteen I had that message but I felt something missing\nA so they gave great for ... yeah\nBut you can see ... it's my effort to get at feeling yeah and how detached it can be come from fat\n[noise] yeah send you something I I think a lot about it and to me this comes through in you talking about um the deep story cars and that and as you said the facts facts and moral pre sects\nA rise out of the deep store and we actually have these take some milk shake that mattered eight storey\nMove them from it right about facts and it's not about moral and writes either it's a ... true yeah and and be when I went back and forth between Berkeley and the people I came to note and really respect and\nThe other world of\nThe south I'm south with with the you know\nI came to to realize that if there were different truths you differently in truth and so there are facts I Believe in the reality of mess yes\nThe deep story and again we all have the story um it repels certain facts that don't fit it and it invites other facts to do [noise]\n\nI'm Krista temp and this is on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion early horseshoe [noise]\n\nYou in a strangers and they're on land um take up what you call it ... the whole issue um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamics anytime but the great paradox and um [noise]\nYou know you point at this dynamic that in a\nPart of the country you're in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and ... great pollution and great relief resistance to regulating polluters and I I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that\nWhich say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a there's a background I think\nUm partly I think people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the federal government was a bigger better\nVersion of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out it's the state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this pathogen in the book that I uh and strangers in their own land that I I just just just as an example of this and maybe this person you're talking about you know\nAlways seems to come down on the little guy he no he says his take this by you if your motor boat leaks little gas into the water the war no right you up but if companies like thousands of gallons of it and kill all the life here the state let's go\nRide that example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are are so rich and powerful that and say basically have a bond [laughter] the legislature and that there was that the companies have outsourced the moral charity work to the state\nSo they say okay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developed let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives them in it for\nIt I think it was one point six billion dollars that uh was in the last five years and there is an offer to companies yeah to come in with that public money now with came from Texas [laughter] I'm\nHis aides and can make donations to the autumn on\nSociety or for a new football uniforms for out west you ... you know looking good and setting up third grade classes in chemistry meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits a [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed at like candy so the state looks terrible the company it looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you can say to get you to feel like the company is your friend to feel like the state does your enemy\n[noise] yeah and there's ... you also describe [noise] this interesting dynamic that um that again is is new want it's not something that would be obvious anybody on a lot of this is true but I mean for example you um\nYou you had this chapter called there are members\n... and there is something where you you a decision made ... about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power and then you say\nSo ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory cell in part to respectful clerks and federal offices internal environmental is\nSo much complexity there\nYeah [laughter] sure heart does mine yes oh yeah yeah\nBecause the people I came to know are no more about the environment they know you know which fish are in what area where you had the crab pots where you know what ducks you can shoot at what period of of the year\nThey love their land and yet\nAnd yet they're they're caught I mean people work in the plants and I talked to a woman who said\nYou know I asked do you talk to your neighbors about ah environment she said you know our neighbors working plants and uh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused\nYou know as if the people working the plants would take on the guilt right or is that we got along with it and you know what it is it's not their personal guilt uh\nIt's the absence of\nA regulation here their rules here right you know I like California is very strict rules we enjoy it cleaner environment as a result it's at that level the guilt it's not a personal one right so that I felt it was very poignant and sweet I've heard to be mindful that\nYou know an operator might feel accuse\n[noise] yeah [noise] and scan like poignant this whole thing gets it as well and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here and we made we made it does make things messy right but again I you know I just feel like you are for this is saying let's let's deal with reality\nNot wishful thinking\nAnd let's talk about reality and not wishful thinking by having a simple a respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is bullying conversation only anybody else you know you are you coming together\nTo see if there can be common ground on the environment and there can be I think that people I came to know are very interested and very proving a ...\nA renewables in fact there's something called the green tea moved from the Tea Party that's all for renewables\nBut we're not even finding common ground because we weren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our bubble still in fact I I think that problem remains with us and especially on the left I think uh\nThere's a kind of a rich it sort of it we're turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out\nLooking for potential common ground [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAfter a short break more with our Lee ...\nWe're putting all kinds of great extras into my pod cast feet poetry music and the new feature lifting the questions\nGet it all as soon as this release twenty subscribed to being an apple pie cat Google type cast modify of wherever you like to listen\nNo mhm no I don't know ... it just means being emotionally intelligent\nYou've developed way of talking\nUm yeah actually that is the fundamental floor of social interaction you barrel on in there and ignore the competence and [noise] uh identities pushing it off to yeah shift counterproductive it is counterproductive\nAnd I sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nYou know any points that might be made I I Want to see you know do you want to be right in every moment you know or do you want to be part of the larger healing [noise]\nThat's right that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help build a a public conversation about the big issues that day and Law Order to do that\nYou have to really be good at a emotion management [laughter] you know make it it's a contribution to the larger whole to be really good\nAt that [noise] um [noise]\nI'm Krista Tibetan dishes on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion hardly hawk shield [noise]\nI'm not a poignant things I felt and throughout strangers in their own land and this time\nIt you've spent um [noise]\nIn Louisiana is\nAnd it's a Bible belts right I mean one of the things you found which I think it's an interesting critique for\nYou know the more the side that considers itself to be an lightened is um [noise] uh\nThat regulation that a lot of the things that are coming up people that's what needs to be done in fact it's not about\n... herring like not about how do we whole I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made a lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense than the government\nMhm so that's a question okay what has the government done phew that's you know maybe they will point may be a it hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed such things\nLet's have a right back for public conversation about just that [noise] it is the the government kind of um [noise]\nIn fact letting people down you know ah or they expecting too much of it what's the record oh let's let's talk about that and the specifics yeah yeah\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just ... even among the most ardent an extreme I mean I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met or five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Anne Janette reducing prison populations for nonviolent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure\nUm ... it's so interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise]\nRight [laughter] wherever I'm hanging fruit right yeah\nMhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm\nYou I'm and I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to Louisiana friends on the argument say ... you know if if you imagine if Iraq if I'd a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to your friends on the liberal left I was just it kind of humanizing and its provocative and a human way consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience and what if you\nGrew up in a family I'm assuming he said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know [noise]\nUm okay what if that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know and what if it was the blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job\nNo [noise] I think that there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or when people with different political\nViews I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left or at the blue collar class that lived there serious look we're the daily workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair or telephone ... or ... or roads were\nWho were you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each here and uh I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of old cocoon and I've long been here\nAs I Am a kind of you know it's not only a contempt that really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it um and that is buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out at ...\nA lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions because we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them\nWhat we need our sturdy coalitions that and I think labor unions when the labor movement was much larger and and uh there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nRight right with different colors yeah in in classes got together natural way and it would be theory on each other they we're here yes public school system is but we're down on those\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year required of every one\nOf every one where have you know yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different regions and get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go cross a to see if we can rebuild does\nThat connective tissue yeah\nI'm I'm sure people have said to you and I I I can into this conversation myself that um\n[noise] there's critique that you know [laughter] they're all kinds of groups of people including like people of color um who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country and then ran this late right and I knew yeah yes and especially now yet again and\nIt's when white people\nThat that you know the critique that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people um\nHow do you have you work with that in your mind\nIt's true and I think it's a it's an important insight [noise] yes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example the opiate\nAddiction problem has has been oh now they're called a diseases of despair\nAnd which is kind of a compassionate way crack epidemic with no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities which at blacks ah wasn't it was criminalized aligned life yeah yeah that's right yeah even worse [noise]\nSo and then said it's a point is that should be broadly received mhm\n[noise] so and when it draws you're close to suspend just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "19"}
