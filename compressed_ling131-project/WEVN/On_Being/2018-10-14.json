Missoula and blue city and\nAn outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big followings on contrasting ends of the U.S political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the two most of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson she was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThere were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at one spy bedrock different and good will and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening Mm\nI'm Krista ... and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the Denison theater in Missoula, Montana\nAnd was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nSo you know as as I moved to two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\nUm\nThe deep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we got to this place and um\nYou know Sally you uh\nYou know you you mean you say you're a liberal like your credentials are from\nUm thank you and I don't think [laughter]\nI've worked really hard to say that\nI'm\nOne of the interesting things you did you've done as you actually well he said he said I think he said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying that you know that you actually\nCalled a bunch of them up a dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls even the word\nWe choose trolls right that the ... you know maybe she creatures who live on damages and throw rocks at a very deep you speak humanizing latch\nYes um and I say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um\nNo one thinks they're mean no\nOne thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good ... and these trials didn't think they were\nDoing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or cruel or unkind um and and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio and online um and they're going through a real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\n[noise] um no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful no one\nWants to be hateful okay what do we do is that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness well the only thing I was just saying that this was I think part of that is that\nThey also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and we've forgotten it's\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel that way you were feeling and\nThey had the opportunity a lot of them apologize thanks but why did you then do it right and this sort of it has something\nTo do with a lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads and so I mean there are studies that when people have\nTo uh you know are sort of challenge to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to\nWe behave more kindly to there's this ... of technology that then allows us to\nExactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing an ambulance by it yeah yeah yeah\nI'm ... so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse\nI happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually on us what I really think I'm curious if you agree with Eric is I I've come to think that\nAh that the left by and large uh\nIs nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity in general [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what I like let's try to yeah do books um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have\nHabit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ... and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal to say oh they're game Trump supporters me that there are still exist and they're so Islamophobia and I hate them\nBecause they're so hateful I hate it out I mean\nAnd we blame the people for than expressing these views as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's intention to be good\nAnd assume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume I tried very hard to assume that you liked me in spite of some of the but in spite of some of the things I Know you've read then and there and it's written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best in people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou've actually called that a daily spiritual practice I guess that's just you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught in one of the related dynamics swell up this\nWhich is that the culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot of good to hear a pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm route a whole chapter in the book about that well yes\nAnd um and the word goat was in it and yes I'd like to talk too much when I wrote about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and energy and beyond ... ask Erick Erickson what a you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse\nUsed the word so we made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ... it was just I didn't know\nCouple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership over though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bringing up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you and say this about the right actually I wrote several weeks ago about people in the right\nSuddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way ... and the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record all those but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city block\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics when Washington is the be all end all everything everything's abstract because none of us are in Washington\nI'm you know look I think it's very\n... two points it's it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that before the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had\nSegregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on\nAnd that that provincial as um that that especially given the historical way and which are neighborhoods have been shaped led to a a lot of my opiate so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I am clear on it which is\nI Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way [laughter] to go first to like look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that said that professes\nUm that people can change and grow and in fact that is a core of progressive\nPolitics is that please don't stay where we've been\nAs a country in the divisiveness of\nRacial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that that didn't make sense it invites\nChange in the country and in individuals and so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change and ...\n... when you say this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we we've got a we've got to improve we can improve the others are we going to reverse I\nAnd I get a lot these days we'll that's unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just this it absolutely is this the lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and divisiveness is one of the strongest tools in their toolbox\n... [noise] um\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip is we we know from neuro science that when people a sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they picked aside\nAnd\nNo one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise] um\nI mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives and our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological or it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have these stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we that's quick progress on gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims\nYou know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out as [laughter]\n[laughter]\nBut there are studies that you know look kids who\nGo to racially integrated elementary schools\n... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities and after school programs are actually reduce\nTheir racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other\nThen has a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we I'm\nAs we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility\nIs not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally said\nI haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you said some of them not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been in\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us and we're all centers um\nWhat is the experience you have of what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nThe experience myself\nOf being unexpectedly kind\nIn the face of\nPeople being cruel on line or off\n\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself\nIn for Neal better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [laughter] [noise]\nUm but it and then as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like\nI\nHad the privilege of finding example after example I mean\nThere are credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things\nAnd who the targets of that hate\nShowed\nKindness and generosity and transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness\nAnd I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden that\nIn a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I get that there are times where it feels daily ... Adam and in some cases it's too much to ask for long enough to ask it of the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people\nLike they are all ...\nAnd so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work and I I Am blown away by the difference it makes it which\nI'm always struck um ... if it just riddle to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall the serpent in the apple is actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us concoct relationships in communities on line\nAnd we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes a Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will that try then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we were with a wife\nWho has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years\nUm and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line or and not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related ... that we both begin having these internal conversations\nUm with having kids um that level of local and I don't mean to keep our local here there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer\nThat everyone should learn to cook because you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know\nUm there's a there's a great Christian also rose area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse\nAnd she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and there is no better community in America\nThan the gay community where an unlocked door and a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings our blessings to be shared with over there\nSo [noise]\n[noise]\nFree Jesus um\nLet me just it is\nWe under value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be solved around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them [noise]\nAnd this is on being today with Eric Ericson and Sally\nOkay we could finish one minute early which it please something deep and my radio bonds that I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes that are I\nDon't know if this is just\nRan for the two of you and in this round that very much on my mind is so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so fixated from ...\nSupport for HP I'd live stream comes from you our listeners and from castle in the clouds Milton burl", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Keene", "day": "14"}
