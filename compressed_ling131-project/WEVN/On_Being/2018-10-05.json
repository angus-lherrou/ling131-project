that um is that so many or aware of\nOh yeah it's definitely something I've I've been aware of\nI I Can't speak for all of my generation and I cannot speak for all local to people\nUm so I have ... family who is Christian mhm but certainly it for me it's like the more traditional teachings that are important to me as I said before\nBut even learning about those things it's something that has come slowly because you know you have to find the right people\nAnd you know right family members and who have that kind of knowledge yeah to share a there's a great diversity even in our own communities in and I think that has a lot to do with the history of race yeah Yahoo and people had to pray somehow [laughter]\nAnd then on the other hand she said for non native people cheering and listening to these narratives these histories yeah and engaging in a conversation that is not about guilt\nAnd it's not about shame it is about in her words I think she said I'm freedom from denial

talking about something very specific but we're speaking in a moment of time of incredible fracture\nAnd there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to be apologized for [laughter] I'm a you know it's one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it and it's not just the ... not only talking about history you're you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about\nWhat an apology is and and how when apologies are done well I've been in assisting sitting there are scientists are studying to write\nAnd I just what you just said I mean ... they can now watch someone gave a real apology and haven't received and have it start changing things in their brain\nOh really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has since you're I mean there's there's I contact and so you register that you register that anyway so you wrote in the beginning at the actually the beginning of your response

deliberation Nick this isn't just something we need to learn to do together right as a people in that part of your citizenship\nYeah there's the physical presence the energy that is important but\nOn a national scale I mean it's also not just a personal apology so there's things that um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say you know a family member sit down next to me and apologize [laughter] I'm at a national\nLevel there's a lot more that goes with it right um when I was writing this response or I started researching a lot of other apologies around the world or a national apologies\nOne of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada a first nations people the first nations right yeah I'm On the boarding school the residential schools\nFor what happened there and the taking of their children and so on and that apology was read out loud\nIt was like a verbal speech it was a transmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality there is a very different quality to the language and pacing of that apology [noise]\nUm I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder a an elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said in her opinion no things had really not really changed\nBut she said in just very very simple terms she said you know if you want things to change\nAll you have to do is begin by honoring your treaties huh and doing what you said you would do\nYeah but I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building right in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or at a national level [noise]\nHey what other things you point out is that um and this was President Obama signed this or that it was signed on weekends and it's not read aloud there was no ceremony\nAnd they were no tribal leaders invited to witness it\nI'm right and that ceremony is an important\nWay and\nTribal culture to make something meaningful to signify that something has meaning\nMhm\nI think it's important in tribal culture but I think we have ceremonies all the time the White House yeah [laughter] yeah right right right I mean it seems like there's all kinds of ceremonies going on there at the White House [laughter] you know [laughter] Mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah I sort of life [laughter]\nI yeah I mean you know all of these things for [noise] first of all I really I I feel like I have to all constantly put out this ... um before I ever talk on some of these issues because\nYou know I I just I'm so wary of of sounding like I'm Talking for for all ... people and and all native people and I'm certainly not an expert\nOn any of these issues but it is again it goes back to this idea of relationship and seeing it in that way I mean even just for example one of my friends posted something really funny on a Facebook\nThis morning I think and she was a reminding people when they're um to what was I think red will oh this is the season for getting rid willow and she was saying now everybody be careful and don't you know take more\nThan you need and leave the plant\nAllow the plant to stay alive for the next um the next year rate so it is always like even just things like that you know like little Facebook post or what have you I mean it's still alive this awareness right um\nSome guy living a sensibility ... of connection and\nYou don't see the red willow as a um a resource writer you are right something you just take from right it is something you take from but you do it respectfully right and the same place horse to water and the source of life [noise]\nWonder um you mentioned them a little while ago the ear that you do talk about your daughter a lot and and your poetry and I know that you know and I like I talk among my children and my show um\nI I wondered if you had to read and and maybe this will like you were to use about because I'm not a ... year not speaking for you're just speaking for yourself right but that a single voice of integrity and searching is a window in right to a world\nIn a way that often asking somebody to represent a group in factors not um there's this part in whereas there's the part that I can write the page whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother\nTo teach what it is to be like whoa to mhm\nOh okay let me find okay or maybe I'll read the first two they got me kind of can yeah OK yeah\nWhereas\nHer birth signal the
