Mexico we spoke in two thousand Seventeen\nA couple of years ago I interviewed sitting balls great grandson or an appointment and it was added was preparing for that interview that I first learned that it wasn't until Nineteen Seventy eight that the American Indian religious freedom act\nUm gave the Lakota and other tribes the right to perform their sacred rituals and ceremonies that these things had been decreed barber is ...\nIn Eighteen eighty three and a law that occurs to me that you more or less grew up in the aftermath of that shift although probably when it was still in transition I'm just curious about that um is that somebody or aware of\nOh yeah it's definitely something I've I've been aware of\nI I Can't speak for all of my generation and I cannot speak for all local to people\nUm so I have ... family who is Christian mhm but certainly for me it's like the more traditional teachings that are important to me as I said before\nBut even learning about those things it's something that has come slowly because you know you have to find the right people\nAnd yeah the right family members and who have that kind of knowledge you to share a there's a great diversity even in our own communities and and I think that has a lot to do with the history of race yeah Yahoo and people had to pray somehow [laughter]\nAnd then on the other hand she said for non native people hearing and listening to these narratives these\nHistories yeah and engaging in your conversation that is not about guilt and it's not about shame it is about in her words I think she

[noise]\nYeah I feel like we're talking about something very specific but we're speaking at a moment of time of incredible fracture\nAnd there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to be apologized for [laughter]\nI'm a\nKnow it's a one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it and it's not just that you're not only talking about history you're also bringing in\nFrom life about\nWhat an apology is and and how when apologies are done well\nI've been in assisting sitting there are scientists are studying to write\nBut just what you just said I mean you they can now watch someone gave a real apology and haven't received and have it start changing things in their brain\nOh really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has since ... contact and so you register that you register that anyway so you wrote in the beginning at the actually the beginning of your response whereas when offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders\nHigh or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through\nUm I listen for cracks and ... and the word choice what is it that I Want\nTo feel and mind do I feel from a sensitive\n... [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was really important deliberation Nick this isn't just something we need to learn to do together right as a people in that part of your citizenship\nYeah there's the physical presence the energy that is important but\nOn a national scale I mean it's also not just a personal apology\nSo there's things that um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say\nYou know a family members sit down next to me and apologize [laughter] I'm at a national level\nThere's a lot more that goes with it right um when I was writing this response or I started researching\nA lot of other apologies around the world or a national apologies\nOne of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada yeah the first nations people the first nations right yeah I'm On the boarding school the residential schools\nFor what happened there and taking them their children and so on and that apology was read out loud\nIt was like a verbal speech it was a transmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality there is a very different quality to the language\nAnd pacing of that apology um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder or an elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said in her opinion no things had really not really changed\nBut she said in just very very simple terms she said you know if you want things to change\nAll you have to do is begin by honoring your treaties huh and doing what you said you would do\nYeah but I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building right in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or at a national level\nI mean what other things you point out is that um and this was President Obama signed this um [noise] that it was signed on a weekend it was not read aloud there was no ceremony\nI'm right\nAnd that ceremony is an important way\nAnd\nTribal culture to make something meaningful or to signify that something has meaning\nMhm\nI think it's important in tribal culture but I think we have ceremonies all the time the White House yeah yeah right right right yeah I mean it seems like there's all kinds of ceremonies going on there at the White House [laughter] you know [laughter] Mm\n\nYears lately long soldier reading some lines from her book where as I did not desire in childhood to be a part of\nThis but desired most of all to be a part of peace combined with others to make up a whole some but not all have something\nIn ... it's ... ...\nApiece or part of anything like the creek trickling behind my aunt's house where uncle ... bridge to cross from bank to bank not far from a grassy clearing with three key piece a place to gather\nI think of planes wins snow drifts ice and limbs the exposure and when I slide my arms into a wolf coat and put my hand to the door not ready to breed this sub Zero Dark\nSomeone says be careful out there always consider this know your friends\nThink badly of it snow will bring you\nAn ... remembering that for millennia we have called ourselves ... meaning friend\nOur ally\nThis relationship\nSome but not all\nStill our piece to everything [noise] [noise]\nOh\nMm\nMm\nMm [noise]\nAfter a short break more with lately long soldier [noise] we're putting all kinds of great extra poetry music and a new feature living the questions into our pod cast feet get it all as soon as it's released twenty subscribes on being on apple pod cast Google pod cast spot a fi\nOr wherever you like to lessen\nSupport for being with Krista tip it comes from the ...
