founder and former director of the center for contemplative mind into science team she's just written a new book together with Romney us walking each other home conversations on loving and dying we spoke into that I'm Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life your early life\nWell my early in life\nI was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war I say the second world [laughter] and you have to be the war [laughter] and um [noise]\nThere wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning for my whole childhood and um\nUh we didn't quite know what to do that but many of us were really profoundly affected by it and felt that\nIn some way or other we wanted to well first integrated into our own lives fully and then share it with others and so most of them are single and came back and wanted to teach\nJust with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and uh had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back\nMeditation we still had the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no one could imagine [laughter] right [laughter] ah [laughter]\nSo but I was just just committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um our lives in the west so\nFirst I started a business with my then husband John Bush and was eliminated and and yeah yeah but when I was most interested in at a looming nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated in ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood you know where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the species and\nAnd at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later\nArrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative\nMore able to ah bring their their whole settled into work and to be able to grow from their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\n[laughter] right right [noise] that is a chef that is still a\nStill has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American\nIdeals and practicalities\nThis story of searching set yourself\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you\nThat you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take yeah\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemporary of mind and he called up and well first of all he said when\nI was younger he been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him\nSo he'd been thinking for some time at Google that or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told\nTheir engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission but they could decide but it was so ... decided it was going to be bringing meditation and things that are posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help\nSo I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and what we identified and was that people ... employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise]\nHad been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasize the practices that\nThat more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could framing and a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they are the big search engine search inside yourself and then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction\nAnd we asked Danny Goldman who also was in bug guy or with us back all those great guy\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and\nUh the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we posted the course and in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand\nGoogle lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about bringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it\nHelps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question\nAnd he sang it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing but\nThis is a serious course and\nYou sit down and quiet down can calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes you know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken\nTo the next kind of level of depth in order for people to begin to question right higher but this course actually\nOffers enough time practice and a teaching to help\nPeople do that [noise]\nAnd refreshing thing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice like yeah politically correct us um [noise] but you know nearby something that really\nSo intrigues me in um in your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has [noise] you know has is faring noble lineage um [noise] you know it's what is um that is the tradition that has focused on this for thousands of years\nBut you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again is a very root of judgment character and will\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was British But that is the intention right of\nYeah that is and that's just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland yeah and William James hall\nMhm um who became a teacher to all these figures who have gone on especially in narrow science to oh yeah this is David Sanger Daniel Goldman cliffs Erin Marquette steam\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and they knew something in your work they just read you pull through and seeing that this\nContemplative impulse\nIs a kind of human tradition as much as it is in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis and the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that forward for me and it's really\nCritically him so much [laughter]\nI'm honored [laughter] but\nBut it's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we are we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful in sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it started right and um we interviewed\nEighty people we identify this was in Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew a number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for\nAround and I mean I Know there was bored I don't there's no romance attached to this but somehow we survived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in\nYeah that is completely gone now\nDaydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain um I don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students are also we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and and a deep relaxation and um of course they weren't\nAllowed to use their phones during the day [laughter] but it's just it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and\nEveryone who's ever done a yoga class you know no such like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brats fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter]\nI'm sure their phones and about lying\nDown [laughter] for far right they brought their phones in front of their face [laughter] [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's so great wind just right [laughter]\nRight well okay so and you did not all that beautiful workers Google and Google is part of the problem here you are to the point that nothing is pure and um but you have written about and\nIt's very practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what'd you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google loves that she put it in her magazine and put 'em I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise]\nYou just type out your email either a response or initiating email and then you stop\nTakes a deep breaths follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then you read the email\nYou read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on an emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or do you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we\nSupport for any ... life's dream comes from you our listeners and from conquered regional visiting nurse association\nA home health in hospice agency serving people of all ages and more than forty one communities discover how the conquered regional DNA can help you remain independent in your home and live life to the fullest\nDid it the RV an A. dot org I picked up the phone [laughter]\nRight [laughter] so you know I mean there we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really see I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change yeah but what mindfulness compassion practices and others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand for repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing enmity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger 'cause it clouds mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate acronym Annie and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it I communicated we did a lot of work with lawyers and judges\nAnd see how that lawsuit and is there anything about that I Want to ask you about that are so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental\n[laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it's yeah you know it they will lawyers worry that\nCan they be zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case\nAnd um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment it's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are\nUnbelievably overworked they have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this was probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and they loved it\nI just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it was about two to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting\nRight like physically like what we experienced as a present mothers to yeah and also that you can that it can be a longer\nRight which is all you meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can just be be uh [noise]\nI'm Krista tip and decision on being today with Buddhist teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practices\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I have to say like for myself I have um\nI've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense where the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be\nInstantaneously gratifying right it can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that [noise] but it's very hard\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just seems so pathetic but yeah it it it's our time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean are there\nIs this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well at the center\nWe we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you know we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um\nSomeone doing to be chanting\nWe've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um\nMindfulness of the breads and walking meditation right and my vote listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate the began to appreciate the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation or that", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "26"}
