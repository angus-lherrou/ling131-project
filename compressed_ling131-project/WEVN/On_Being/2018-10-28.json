had told me that I Would someday be training employees have corporate America to apply contemplative practices to help them become more successful I Would have said you'd been standing too long in India is hot new day son\nYet as soon as nearby Bush return to the U.S in Nineteen Seventy three she started a company called elimination and was featured alongside a young Steve Jobs and Fortune Magazine\nMore recently she helped create Google's wildly popular employee program search inside yourself\nNearby Bush is called in to work with educators and judges and social activists and soldiers\nHer odyssey from India ten now tells a defining narrative of our time and it's not just a story of tools that help us be more successful it's a rediscovery and reclaiming of contemplation in many forms and many tradition and secular stick of modern life\nIn the beginning and you couldn't ever say what the environmental leaders called the L Word and [laughter] limit the L Word was love and it's really when someone's heart and hope that things really change\nI hadn't been more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices\nEven and just very secular working situations recently than I used to be because people really want to look for it turns out [laughter] and um\nIt always edges on sounding like a hallmark card but I have found it to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it\nAll I'm Krista tip it and this is on being nearby Bush's co founder and former director of the center for contemplative mind into science team she's just written a new book together with ROM DOS walking each other home conversations on loving and dying we spoke into that I'm Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life or early life\nWell my early life [noise]\nI was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war I say the second world [laughter] and you have to be the war [laughter] and um [noise]\nThere wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning for my whole childhood and um\nUh we didn't quite know what to do that but many of us were really profoundly affected by it and felt that in some way or other we wanted to\nWell first integrated into our own lives fully and then share it with others and so most of them were single and came back and wanted to teach\nJust with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and\nUh had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back meditation we still had the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no one could imagine [laughter] right [laughter] [laughter]\nSo but I was just as committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um our lives in the west so\nFirst I started a business with my then husband John Bush and write was eliminations and yeah yeah but what I was most interested in women nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated and ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice and how do\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really want to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the bases and [noise]\nAnd at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I\nI arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative\nMore able to ah bring their their whole settles into work and to be able to grow from their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\n[noise] right [noise] that is the shaft that is still a\nStill has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture and\nIdeals and practicalities\nThis story of search inside yourself\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you\nThat you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take yeah\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemporary of mine and he called up and well first of all he said when\nI was younger he been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineer number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission but they could decide but it was so ... decided it was going to be bringing meditation and things that are posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help\nSo I went out there and we talked and we looked around and what we identified was that people ... employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise]\nHad been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could\nOffer the same practices but emphasize the practices that\nThat more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself and then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction\nAnd we asked Danny Goldman who also was in bug guy or with us back all those great guy\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and\nUh the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we posted the course and in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand\nGoogle lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about bringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question\nSupport for an HBO ... live stream comes from you our listeners and from service credit union supporting businesses throughout New Hampshire from visionary development projects to fundamental banking needs programs and services designed for businesses who are ready to grow more I grow with SCU dot\nCom times you know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken\nTo the next kind of level of depth in order for people to begin to question right there but this course actually offers enough time practice and\nA teaching to help people do that [noise]\nI mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that is you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean this not as can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice like yeah politically correct is um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really\nSo intrigues me in um in your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has [noise] you know has this very noble lineage um [noise] you know it's what is um that is the tradition that has focused on this for ... years\nBut you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology said that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is a very root of judgment character and will\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was what is that that is the intention right of yeah that is in and that's just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYeah in William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures who have gone on especially in narrow science to this Ritchie Davidson Daniel Goldman cliffs Aaron mark Epstein [noise] and also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker\nAnd they lose something in your work they just read you pull through and seeing that this\nContemplative impulse\nIs a kind of human tradition as much as it is in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis and the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that forward for me and it's really crazy\nHim so much [laughter]\nI'm honored [laughter] but\nBut it's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we uh we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful in sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started right and um we interviewed\nEighty people we identified this was in Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew a number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for\nAround and I mean I Know there was bored I mean I don't there's no romance attached to this but somehow we survived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in\nYeah that is completely gone now\nDaydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain [noise] um I don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students are also we\nAt the end of the day we did that the yoga and in a deep relaxation and um of course they weren't\nAllowed to use their phones during the day [laughter] but it's just it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done yoga class you know no sets like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter] for their phones and brought lying\nDown [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their face [laughter] [laughter] I couldn't believe it it was like the little ... girl and ... what's so great wind just right [laughter]\nRight well okay so I knew were denied all that beautiful workers Google and Google is part of the problem here you are to the point that nothing is pure and um but you have written about and\nIt's very practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really interesting\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google loves that she put it in her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise] you just type\nOut your email either a response or an initiating email and then\n... de Presse follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to thank you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective\nAnd then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it\nThere was a week and between the classes and so a week later they came back and I said how did it go and um they all said that was radical you know ... and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that\nI picked up the phone [laughter]\nRight [laughter]\nSo you know I mean that we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute 'cause I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really ... I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes\nUp so often with activists is that if I give up my anger will I lose my motivation\nRight and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change yeah what what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out around your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as energy energy in your body right but but the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger 'cause it clouds mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it and communicate it\nWe did a lot of work with lawyers and judges and\nSee how that last time the training about that I Want to ask you about that are so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental\n[laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it's yeah you know it they will lawyers worry that\nCan they be a zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men\nIs not eliminating wise discernment it's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are\nUnbelievably overworked they have so many people coming in front of them all day\nAnd they said you know some young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this is probably who he is and what he's done right and they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear\nAnd open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard\nSo just being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and they loved it oh yeah\nI just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it has about two to three seconds long\nKind of interesting great like physically like what we experienced as a present moment is too yeah and also that you can that it can feel longer\nRight which is I sing meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can just if it would be the uh [noise]\nI'm Krista tip and dishes on being today with what his teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practices\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I should say like for myself I have some\nI've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise] even a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously\nGratifying right it can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that but it's very hard\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just seems so pathetic but you know it's as you say that it's our time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you she worked with so many different practices I mean are there\nIs this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well\nAt the center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered\nYou know we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices his brother David teaching Christian practices um someone doing to be chanting we've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um\nMindfulness or the breads and walking meditation right and my listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation or that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Keene", "day": "28"}
