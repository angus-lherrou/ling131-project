humanitarian catastrophe that as a result of a natural disaster or of a naturally occurring shortage of food in these areas\nOn the country when we were travelling through Yemen and in many of the towns we visited the stores full of food the problem is that nobody are very few people can afford to buy it because the country's economy has been devastated and the economic devastation is a direct product of the way that the war has been waged\nLargely by Saudi Saudi led coalition some of the decision they have taken by withholding reviews from a million civil servants in government controlled and\nWho'd be controlled areas has had an absolutely devastating effect on the local economy as well as the plunge into the value of the Yemeni currency and\nThose kind of decisions have meant that people have far less money than before I'm the bunny they have is worth fall on that and for people who are already living on the brink this is enough to push move at the edge\nAnd ah which one it said was talking to Declan Walsh of the New York times and he's joining us from Skype in Cairo Declan what is the international community's response to this and what is has it been so far it has it been sufficient because to say that there is food and yet there's this famine happening it just seems devastatingly cruel\nWell over the last uh over this summer the international community response has focused largely on the effort by the Saudi led coalition to capture a port called who data\nThat is the gateway for about three quarters of international humanitarian aid the entrance Yemen so a lot of the concern has focused on ensuring pressuring the competence that the fighting should not reached a port and stop the supplies reaching the country but increasingly now because of the\nNature of this bomb or the\nThreatened bombing and the problem with the collapse of the economy a lot of stress now he's on trying to\nPressure the parties to impose measures that would allow the economy to

belonging to tailor energy setting off a massive oil spill on the coast of Louisiana that's been growing steadily for fourteen years\nEveryday the site is feeling between three hundred seven hundred barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico Taylor Energy has cleaned up some of the math but they've also been suing the government to avoid a full clean up on the site and if the spill is not stop soon it's on track to become one of the worst in us history Michael ... is a reporter\nWith the Associated Press and he's been reporting on the Taylor oil spill for years Michael thanks for joining us thanks for having me I push it to this spill started in two thousand and four and it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this tell us about that what did they find\nWell they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years the latest estimates which were put together by independent researcher from Florida found that between ten thousand thirty thousand gallons of oil is leaking daily\nFrom multiple wells around that platform that toppled over during hurricane Ivan in two thousand and four\nAnd the reason why this is an issue now after all these many years is that our energy company based in New Orleans that doesn't advocacy assets anymore is essentially only exist to fight this bill is trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that it set aside years ago to try to end this leak they want the money back\nThe government says no you need to do more to finish what you started here down below the surface of the Gulf\nObviously there's a money issue here but what is it about this spill that why is it taking so long for this to stop this looks like it's an environmental disaster that's been going on in our own backyard\nWell hadn't gotten a lot of attention until recently that ... that's true the company's position is that basically look this is not any different than the natural seeps that occur out there out in the Gulf of Mexico that are harmless\nThat's their position is are they right about that though while I mean that's I think that's open to debate certainly and um ah the government's position is very different that that does pose a potential threat to the environment and that they have to go out there and do it they can the problem is\nIs that when that hurricane rolled through and knocked over\nThe uh drilling platform it also buried the underground wells under mountains of a settlement that they cannot go in simply dredge without risking somebody's life that's the company and with the company says no company did kill some of the wells they said but\nThey said that nothing more can be done without causing tension greater risk if they go in there and they\nTake the settlement are way could make the week even worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like between the government\nAnd the company about what needs to be done next but the government believes that something can be done and they I Believe are going to order the company to do something else on their below the surface\nI'm just wondering the Taylor oil spill is back in the news but\nIn twenty ten I Can't forget the images of the BP oil spill they were laying on loop and I'm Wondering how this is affecting the environment differently than the BP oil spill didn't Wilton\n... tend to be pretty well so as we all remember we were kinda transfixed by images of this billowing wave of crude oil coming out of the bottom of the sea for ... it was coming out all at once you know over the period of grad\nI Believe three months or so but that massive amount of oil came out all at once and that as you know oil birds on the seashore and it created an environmental catastrophe and in this case this has been a slow motion environmental problem with a tailor energy it's it's seeped out slowly and\nI'm not a scientist but I've been told that the damage and the effect is far less serious when it's staggered out in the oil can be weathered by waves and water and it doesn't have quite the same impact also the company has said that there is no evidence\nThat this oil from the ... is reaching shores about twelve miles off the coast of Louisiana and these slicks stretch for miles every day or almost every day but\nDon't flex also have an impact on the environment whether we can feed them or not I mean who's supposed to make sure that this is an environmentally sound place\nAgain I Believe that there are some a disagreement about this between the two sides of the company has its own experts who say that there is no environmental ecological risk or danger or damage and then the government says\nDifferently that there's at least the potential for damage to the ecology out there even if it's not oil and birds on the shore and you know there's fish there's other marine life out there that could be affected by these persistent and chronic leaks\nSo we know the Taylor Energy is suing the federal government what else are they doing we understand that one of the former owners we do is a prominent philanthropist in Louisiana\nYeah so the Taylor name or his best known probably in Louisiana for a program called tops the tea and top switches financed free college tuition for many families over the years the this is a couple [noise]\nDidn't have kids of their own said vested a lot of money in um helping other people millions of dollars and ... work is Taylor his widow is also a very influential political figure donor too many congressmen and senators and she had hired\nLawyers or to lobby on Capitol Hill to try to get the company a break so it's still a of a fight that's ongoing both in court and also a separately the company I tried to petition the somewhat obscure a government agency\nTo give it a relief from this a long standing orders that it had to do more down below the sea floor in terms of drilling a intervention well to try to kill underground well so there's two fronts but primarily it's just become case about money\nAnd about how much more than you to spend or have available to spend down below the surface [noise]\nMake all kinds of minutes a reporter with the Associated Press Michael thanks for joining us\nNothing for having me\nTo be found these scientists working around the Gulf about the Taylor oil spill bird and ask for a marine geologist at the University of southern Missouri told us that he thinks Taylor Energy should not have to clean up the site\nThat they should fund scientific research does that mean for me\nThere about twenty oil blowout and federal and state water every year professor ... says scientists used the Taylor oils no to examine the impact of the ... how the sea floor community response to it how it interacts with plankton and how oil is transported from the to the more\nThe facts are asked for office said some scientists have requested intentional releases of oil basically creating a bill in the Gulf to study these effects but the Taylor I could be a good compromise\nWhat do you think about solutions like
