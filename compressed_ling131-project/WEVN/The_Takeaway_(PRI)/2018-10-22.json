or ... has it been for you to cast your ballot\nThere were no lines that was pretty empty and they're seeing smoothly run I went in and vote and headed on home fortunately mine was shorter line the other line was wrapped around the block then again I used to live in Oregon where we just vote by mail it was super easy in ...\nNow that I moved to Minnesota I'm kind of anxious about what's going to happen when I go to vote because I've never had to stand in line and go into a booth\nPolling place was just this little house it was going to work and the ...\nIt's a lot of voters came in mission formed about the voting process as soon as it's called something must be really\nGo wrong I Am disabled which makes getting into the voting place sometimes a little bit difficult by federal law each polling place is supposed to be accessible to which I say for talking my voting place has never been accessible\nAnd voting doesn't just very according to who you are and where you live it can also differ based on the type of ballot you cast on election day\nVoting machine was a touch screen machine\nBallot for the paper ballots that but then scan it however the scanner didn't work so I had to

to fix it I'm tansy in Vegas and this is the takeaway [noise]\nThere are more than ten thousand election jurisdictions in this country that's right I said ten thousand and within those jurisdictions are hundreds of thousands of polling places and in a presidential election year you'll need about a million poll workers to make sure things run smoothly\nThat's a huge amount of infrastructure to protect from the kinds of threats we learned about after the twenty sixteen election like the potential for foreign interference in hacking\nAnd other gaps in the system like outdated machines and an equal access to polling places David Becker is here to discuss this splintered system of ours and he's the director and founder of the center for election innovation and research David great to have you on the show thanks for having me\nSo a lot of what we're thinking about here and a lot of what we heard from our listeners is that we really don't all vote in the same way why do we have so many different types of voting in the United states\nWell that's right there's a actually about ten thousand little elections are held on each election day rather than one big one\nAnd that really dates back to the founding the republic where ah in the constitution and in our traditions is a typical that these states have control over elections and within the states the state's often delegate that

Saudi Government uses troll farms to orchestrate digital attacks against dissidents and journalists including ...\nBen Hubbard is the Beirut bureau chief for the New York times and he's been reporting on these social media campaigns\n... farms are basically you know the best way to picture them would be like a call center like you would have you know to to field\nPublic relations were crusts or a customer request something like that except this is this'll be a group of people who've been hired\nTo be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to sort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations there the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this has to attack content\nThat was appeared to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that is positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who was behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest levels of the Saudi Government\nWell it would be pretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is a monarchy it's an authoritarian state so it'd be very unlikely that ah say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government said we know that so one of the officials who was in charge of\nIn charge of the suffered as somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman man who was you know the sort of the fact or ruler of the kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these trolls were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulate hashtags that are already out there so if there's a ... that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that it becomes an away unreasonable\nThey also try to game the algorithms to Twitter has to try to get certain hashtags onto the trending topics\nSo if there's hashtags that picks up or there's some cases may have actually been create created by them they can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that and don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know to take a step back you kind of have to understand how important something like Twitter is in a country like\nThe authoritarian place that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of the newspapers or government owned there's not a lot of public engagement or civil society and they are not really places where you can go and discuss and so\nWhen Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this is going to be this great new technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really had the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they're able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just they know they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who you know our trolls are called her sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on the social media to base of trying to shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they they've apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trending lists on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective and um they they they end up playing a role social media plays a very large role in these countries in just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media doesn't any country\nBut the the differences Saudi Arabia is that they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they get on Twitter they can really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them a perceived their own their own government\nReported on an ex Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person\nWell we know that there was the Saudi engineer or Saudi Saudi tech person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then joined with basically tipped off by American law enforcement and said we have suspicions about this person that he has been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them\nIs not entirely clear but the concerns were great enough that he was using his access to the company and his his access inside of Twitter to basically look up information about certain dissidents and provide that information to the Saudi Government\nAnd wondering if attention to this more now because I'm Jamal 'cause she'll east death um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns was he not\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed had the last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter he was very prolific on Twitter he would tweet in Arabic he would treat in English he would interact with people he would have post articles and\nYou know so so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views\nBut you know somebody like to have that many followers just on his own Twitter account so they put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots and lots of comments and lots and lots of abuse and\nAnd and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list that they were trying to influence the way that the content he was putting out was being received by people\nAt least enough to make clear that Twitter as a company has been under\nFire for a while now for what it allows and doesn't allow on its platform and how it controls what people can say in what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they are said anything about all this from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or how their platform is being used in this instance\nI'm not aware of any direct response from Twitter to the article that we published on Sunday I mean I Know that they they certainly have talked about\nWas you know they put out information a few days ago I'm Talking about a large sort of bought network I think they called it that they had taken down that was sort of a pro pro Saudi ... network that Twitter had taken down\nSo you know there there there are certainly aware of the problem and you know when when when Twitter executive speak about this they say you know well we we want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking\nThings down and less otherwise necessary so I mean I think for what are they they're trying to find the balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but then also\nStepping in when they need to to try to shut down things that are in a serious\nDent Hubbard is the Beirut bureau chief for the New York times then thanks so much for your

delayed for three years\nMore than twenty five hundred candidates were in the running for just two hundred and fifty seats in the run up to the election was extremely tense and deadly threats from the Taliban throughout the country heightened the danger of participating in these elections\nAt least ten candidates as well as dozens of their supporters were killed in the months leading up to Saturday's vote\nBut the day of the election also saw heightened levels of violence follow the exact number is unclear targeted attacks lead to more than thirty six people dead on Saturday alone\n... was reporting in Afghanistan over the weekend he's a correspondent for the BBC based in Islamabad, Pakistan\nWhere there were dozens upon dozens of lived incidents over the puck two days in Afghanistan or including a suicide bombing in the north of of the capital Kabul of which Fifteen people were killed in that incident we understand a suicide bomber was trying to get inside a polling station when police stopped them from doing that\nAt that moment he blew himself up killing people who are around him but having said that fool the tragic loss of life that that was\nBy off gone standards this was an epic cheek Kelly\nFiat set of days many people that fit that that would be in a lot more major attacks I mean I've been reporting from Afghanistan last a year and a half and and some of the attacks that we've seen in the last few months for example\nI I I've seen fifty people being killed in one single attack and we didn't see anything like that so from a security perspective that to me\nThat what people who were killed that wherever attacks people what in some cases prevented from voting we already knew going into these elections that episode will bloating stations across the country we're gonna have to remain closed\nBecause of security concerns\nBought these elections was more peaceful than many fit they would be\nAre they considered democratic by the electorate because of the attacks and the threats and many of the problems we just outlined\nWell enough to understand a lot of people are quite disillusioned with politics after years of violence and corruption\nI see that being in in Afghanistan over the last a week or so that was a lot of people who will also quite optimistic at times because they felt that in these elections are unlike in previous elections and number of the candidate for young well from professional backgrounds but wet educated ...\nAnd people felt that they were in a position to offer of guns are some real medical change and move away from a kind of system of politics that dominated by\nEthnic ... and by old warlords\nHaving said that that has been a lot of criticism within Afghanistan of delays that it could during the election protests are a number of polling stations\nDidn't open on on on Saturday or open late or early voting has to be extended into Sunday or what I was that some of the polling stations people would come and tell me that despite having read just\nTo list the rules have problems with a a new biometric vote to verification system that was introduced a little bit the last minute ready\nIt's designed to prevent people both in more than one but because it was introduced so late a load of this stuff it seems one particularly well trained in how to use it and that helped contribute to the today so there has been a lot of\nCriticism of of the organization of these elections\nYou mentioned a lot of the younger more educated candidates that are running I'm Wondering are there any themes are there any common political threats that they share you know something that might be resonating with this electorate\n[noise] the one thing to note is that in and I've gone to San Juan parliament isn't take powerful in comparison to the to the position that the president um\nThe second is that the political parties on really a dominant into parliament most candidates stand as independence even if they are affiliated political parties because\nPolitical parties in in the country often associated with science journalism and struggle for power so a lot of the people who stand as I say our our independence\nAnd that means that they can ah cultivate their own constituencies of support ready to sit and he was so a lot of people who a form of journalists a civil society activists standing and these are some of the people who\nBoth his wife were quite enthusiastic about alongside them do the rules so a lot of big businessmen um the the children of full my so called warlords who was standing for the first time as well\nSo what a mixed bag of candidates who is standing on a huge number I mean over two thousand five hundred candidates standing across the country in ...\nWhen I was the eight hundred candidates for thirty three seats set a ballot paper was about fifty pages long it's kind of looked like a newspaper rating\nAnd there were about four hundred women who ran among those candidates what can you tell us about them\nExactly so uh that's what I see that different number from the the number of women who ran it into law set a parliamentary elections in two thousand and ten to ... around four hundred women who took part in those\nBut as I say that wherever number of of women among these candidates who people to a more enthusiastic about um I was speaking to to to one a female candidate she's twenty six year old very well known\nA TV reporter in Afghanistan and she was saying to me that uh she was standing because uh she viewed the older politicians is basically being corrupt and an acting like a ...\nA ... in ... and she wanted a Afghanistan to move away from them as what is the fact that there were there were four hundred women are four hundred women standing or I think around sixty percent of the candidates while under the age of forty\nAnd what about the current president a secondary Ashraf Ghani he's been a president for over four years now does he still have support\n[noise] yes he said he doesn't and in fact one of the reasons why these elections are seen as so crucial is because ah next April will have presidential elections and there'll be\nMuch more politically significant because as I say the F. calm political system is quite centralized to the president really is the key to the country and so these parliamentary elections which were meant to have taken place around three years ago and they'd be in the late ... at a sense and then he\n... he just happened now so these elections was seen as a kind of dry run if you if you'd like for those presidential elections\nPeople wanted to see a wood enough off guns feel safe coming out to vote or will the results be accepted that's another crucial question because a previous elections have been marred by allegations of fraud and many fear the same could happen again so these are all key concerns that that the people\nPresidential elections and
