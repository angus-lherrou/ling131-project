crucial race for governor is heating up Democrat Andrew Gillum is facing off against the of the candidate Ron dissent is and voters are closely watching how each candidate is handling the hurricane response effort\nFloridians will also decide on whether or not to restore voting rights to one point five million felons Florida is one of three states along with Iowa and Kentucky that permanently take the vote away from convicted felons\nAnd there are questions about whether people who haven't voted during the last three elections but emerged during the primaries will turn out again David Smiley has been covering all of this is the Miami Herald political reporter David welcome back to the takeaway thanks for having me\nSo there's a lot going on in Florida as we know um midterms are just a couple of weeks away how it was a storm like Michael affecting or it could affect people's engagement not just getting to the polls but their desire to vote\nWhere Michael hit a interestingly is a heavily Republican area and it really wiped out um a lot of the roads the uh infrastructure so immediately we're seeing questions about will those counties in the Florida Panhandle be ready\nTo vote for early voting on Monday and for election day so that will be interesting to watch or they aren't the most\nPopulous counties but that seems like it might affect Republican turnout um and just generally the hurricane has kind of reset\nThe table for the campaigns you know there were topics that were heavily in the media\nBefore the hurricane are formed in the Caribbean and began aiming for Tallahassee and\nThose issues like the economy and red tide were pretty quickly drowned out by hurricane Michael and um the devastation that caused in the ongoing recovery so I think it may change some state wide focus\nFrom voters on what they're thinking about and how they're viewing the candidates as governor Rick Scott runs against Bill Nelson and is heavily involved in recovery efforts in as Andrew Gillum or had to take a break from the campaign or as mayor Tallahassee to handle the storm\nOr Ron dissent is no longer a congressman trying to ship his campaign to remain involved without an official role hurricane certainly shook things up in the campaigns\nDo we know that that's affected Gillum lead at all that he's had to sort of taste step aside to handle the hurricane or is this a campaign still going\nThe polls the recent polls have showed Gillum with a very narrow one point lead a new poll by saint Pete polls are came out this morning the really the first poll a taken\nTo ... to potentially show hurricane effect and it still had Gillum ... plus one\nUm I I think you know the the assumption would be that he would get something of a bump given that he was a so heavily\nOn the the media rotation during and after the store and more dissent is didn't have a invested role and the recovery and the preparations are so I think I think we need to wait and see some of the polls that should be coming out in the next couple of days or weeks or to\nSee whether we'll see any other shift but in a state like\nFlorida where a top of the ticket races are typically decided by one point or I don't think we're going to see either\nThis is a a head or behind by too much\nWe talked a little bit at the opening about the possibility of getting Floridians to restore the right to vote for one point five million former felons in the state has there been any movement can you gauge what the interest is so far I'm On that ballot measure\nWhat late last month we saw a University of north for to pull that had a ballot measure at Seventy one percent support to get on the ballot or the the backers of amendment for uh pursued a petition drive that\nReceived nearly nine hundred thousand signatures which obviously bodes well for support you would figure most of those cigna tours would also voted for the initiative um but in Florida you need you do need sixty percent to pass\nA ballot question and I I Do think one there is a campaign against it and to ... we're going to see some skepticism from people who either may not totally understand what the amendment speaks to do and the fact that I'm convicted felons do have to complete their probation and parole\nIn order to have their rights restored\nAnd then there'll be questions from voters about to what extent are they comfortable restoring voting rights for um people who are convicted certain non violent offenses are and and I don't think that's a slam dunk\nWe talked a little bit also about the fact that a Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the current governor Rick Scott won't be able to appoint three state Supreme Court justices who are the justices who are stepping down and I'm Wondering how that will affect um the liberal majority\nWell right on the seven member court there are three of of four justices who have kind of formed somewhat of a liberal voting bloc and have at times ruled against Rick Scott\nThey are due to age limits are stepping down um the day that the next governor is sworn in and given that that decision\nWill now fall to either Andrew Gillum Iran dissent this and they have such divergent opinions on what the court should look like that seems likely to to energize a they're voting base is I think Republicans tend to be more attuned to issues of the higher courts\nAnd the significance of it and we did see some a speculation that perhaps the Kavanaugh hearings for the U.S Supreme\nCourt might have actually a given Ron dissent is a bum who is trailing\nPretty consistently in the polls by decent margin or and then seem to get a bump around the time of the cabinet hearing so it's possible that that controversy energized\nFor the Republican voters maybe they were hesitant to side with his aunt is over Trump or or or any other issues and I'm In that might have given him a bump so probably better for the Centers for Gillum but certainly Planned Parenthood or abortion rights healthcare rights are\nFront and center in the minds of democratic voters are so I don't think\nThat you know a liberal voters are just going to have their shoulders and think about it there's\nNever a dull moment in Florida that David Smiley from the Miami Herald thanks so much for being with us [noise] they do\n[noise]\nWe want you to be part of the
