difficult to distinguish what's the worst and what's the most threat they're all threatening and they're all bad because they all kill individuals and they all target individual\nThat proves that never I I have to say that I've never um walked into a school or up my place of work and thought and was really afraid for my safety in my life\nI think most Americans these days with the they didn't

trying to vote\nPart of the problem of lumping white supremacist terrorism in with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacist terrorism is

espoused by the G O P and particularly by Trump you don't see as much pushback\nIn terms of labeling Islamic terrorism as his lab at Islamic terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for

international collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston\nPut American voters head to the polls next week there'll be deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle the winners of the midterms have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map that happens every ten years\nAnd it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level here to explain more is Denise Ross barber she's the managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise welcome to the takeaway\nThank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work so after the\nTwenty twenty census is conducted states have to revisit their state legislative and congressional district boundaries and redraw them where needed what are they looking for in terms of redistricting\nDo where the populations are and if new lines need to be drawn or new congressional district need to be established based on\nThe population numbers so for example in Montana we currently have one congressional district and that may have to get rearranged into two and then uh consequently another state would have to lose their district I\nMean there's only certain number of house members in Congress so you can't just keep adding to the number of congressional members so they just get re arrange but mostly\nJust the lines get drawn with regards to who's in what district that's primarily what happens and if you're a state legislator for example you may remain that state legislator but your district boundaries change\nAnd what kind of a role is redistricting playing in our upcoming midterm elections in the vast majority of states the governor and the legislature hold the redistricting pens after the census that means that currently twenty nine governors and more than eight hundred state legislators who are in this year's\nBallot could have a hand in drawing the new maps\nSo it's a fairly important\nProcess that takes place every ten years or you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who will be elected in twenty eight team because they won't be up and twenty twenty so they will be holding redistricting pens\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads I'm coming from\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads I'm coming from superPACs coming from the campaigns themselves individual donors where are you seeing as far as money is concerned\nDuring the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to Gallup ... there are twelve state Senate chambers that could flip based on the upcoming election so\nThere is a group called the national democratic redistricting committee\nWhich is currently run by Eric Holder who also was one of the recipients of a recent bomb threat um and his group to NPR see has given directly to state candidates and political parties\nAlmost six hundred thousand dollars for example they gave two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the\nPennsylvania democratic governor a candidate Thomas Wolfe\nThey've given another two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Georgia Democratic Party\nThey've given thirty six thousand to Wisconsin state parties and they also gay fifty thousand dollars and supportive of Ohio redistricting\nMeasure and this is just money that is going directly to these candidates and the campaigns we don't yet have data on how much money these entities and others are spending independently on state races\nI mean you said it's hard to tell how much money they're spending independently are we able to find out who's funding efforts in state and local races certainly\nThe ... were able to know who is giving directly to the candidates and depending on the state laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups and that's the dark money problem that both races at the state and federal level are confronted with\nWe've seen this in the past and twenty ten how did Republicans what was the Republican strategy back in twenty ten and how effective it was that for them in terms of redistricting\nWell I mean they obviously took clear control of the vast majority of chambers of the state legislatures throughout the country they targeted specific races in order to do so they identified which chambers were most vulnerable and which seats within those chambers were most\nVulnerable and really spent money and they were very successful the Republicans had a majority in almost all of the chamber's across the country or in at least a vast majority of the state legislative chambers many congressional seats also swung Republican\nAnd I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legislatures do the power that they have do you think voters really understand the issues of redistricting\nNot at all [laughter] no okay so if they don't why not I mean this seems to be so critical it's a critical use of our census that's a critical thing for those of us you want to get out and vote and who were voting for why do you think this issue is overlooked or misunderstood or not understood at all\nRight I think because most people are just trying to get through their day in their year and they're worried more about their health insurance and whether or not they have a job and you know who draws a redistricting boundaries is kind of politically ... [laughter]\nThe whole process involves just a lot of ... and and it's really\nA game that's played primarily by the insiders of the political parties the people who are going to the polls and and the voters who are\nPaying attention are paying attention to redistricting but certainly the major political parties and and their allies and these groups like the Indy RC are very aware of it Denise Ross barber is managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise thanks for being with us [noise]\n\n\nThe takeaway is supported by huge originals on roadside attraction presenting ... starring Susan Sarandon as a mother struggling to free her captured journalist son also starting ... in theaters friday\nAnd babble European made language learning program that will teachers practical conversation and Italian Russian Swedish and other languages available maps or or online at B.
