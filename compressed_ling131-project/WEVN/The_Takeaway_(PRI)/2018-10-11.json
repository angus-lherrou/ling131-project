and towns across the country where poverty is inescapable\nIn St Louis Missouri a major component of the crisis is affordable housing there just isn't enough of it and for many of the residents who do manage to get a subsidized place to live conditions only add to the indignity of living and working in poverty there was mole\nInside the parks and so what they did was getting rid of the mole they just have to say so after about a month or two specific coming through you know through the ceiling you know in my basement I had gone through all my gosh you know I'm not [noise]\nThat's January Harris a mother and receptionist in St Louis January went from living in an apartment run by the St Louis housing authority to a townhouse run by a private landlord one that she paid for with help from a federal section ... voucher program\nBut even though she works full time January says the assistant she's getting is not enough\nAnybody that is on section eight or or other town or some type of housing assistance they need is nobody is using that if they don't they're low income families you know again they may be disabled they may not be working so people were three part time job it's not and you know still is not\nThere's a big discrepancy in St Louis and economy that President Trump likes to boast is stronger than ever and the stagnant under class of people trapped in poverty and challenged every month to keep a roof over their heads that is what they teach the beach I'm a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity found in her reporting\nIn St Louis especially in the city of about twenty six point seven percent of the people there are living below the federal poverty level it's very difficult if you are very low or extremely low income to find affordable housing and especially if you need a sense\nThe last time the city opened its housing choice Fouchier commonly known as section eat less than twenty fourteen so when you have people waiting years hoping that they'll be able to receive a voucher\nA for housing that will accommodate them and their children I'm there also are waiting list for a public housing in the city in the county as well\nNow what are your options if you are waiting for a section ... voucher where what do you do in the meantime\nIt's not really a pretty picture people are either in unstable conditions there living with family members I might even be face\nSub par a housing conditions as they wait for years to find housing\nI'm curious if you can help us understand how the section eight voucher program works and um I Know it's a complicated program there are many different kinds but what what is it generally do\nYes so with the U.S section eight housing choice voucher system it allows for a person to seek housing through a privately owned property um and\nThe federal government will pay a subsidy to the section eight accepting landlord and the tenant will pay the difference uh based on their income\nTell us about January Harris January\nHarris I'm live out in Ferguson, Missouri she lives in the county of St Louis\nWithin a week of her moving into her town home for her and her youngest daughter\nMichael Brown was killed by police officer in that housing complex is just a two minute drive away and she has worked for most of her time as an adult down at least I went back to her work history back to two thousand\nAnd so she is technically checking off the personal responsibility boxes that\nPresident Trump Ben Ben Carson has said are ways to get out of the system but at the end of the day it's just not enough she does make money she does technically an above the state's minimum wage job seven eighty five\nBut even with that it's it's hard for her to make ends meet because as soon as she got her job\nUm a local nonprofit in St Louis before she got her first paycheck her rent had increase\nSo I get paid by the way they want to watch it goes completely separate food I Can't see I'm not receiving any child or [noise]\nI work every day for their trees I mean they they made a problem like this is supposed to be Seventy so it was voted family situations where they do not let me say this and there's no way to get off of this I was literally probably\nShe's essentially not able even with her current employment able to even get off of section ... housing right now because money is just too tight\nIs the housing situation that you're describing a where there's limited housing available and long wait times for section ... vouchers is that being exacerbated by gentrification\nAt all I think\nWhen it comes to public housing and section eight housing I'm not quite positive if it's being exacerbated by gentrification my sense a through my reporting is that the housing authorities are\nWander highly underfunded um and that is not a partisan or something unique to this administration\nInto it can be difficult to find landlords who want to accept a section eight housing choice voucher holders because of all the stigma that come with that really that's racism or whether that's your fear that they may not care for the property and also for the landlords are\nThere is a long process of paperwork and inspections that goes into whether or not you choose to be a section eight landlords so I think it's a lot of bureaucracy at play the reason why it's so hard to find affordable housing\nWell let's also talk about what the current administration's stance is when it comes to public housing I'm thinking specifically about Ben Carson a HUD secretary who essentially ... did a twenty Fifteen rule that require communities that receive huts\nGreat their neighborhoods where does that stand\nIn the Nineteen fifties and the Nineteen sixties there was a wave of white flight to the suburbs\nAnd what you have now is a county that is mostly white and in the city it's pretty much predominantly black\nSo there is concerned that there will be more division because of the undoing of this food because it's no longer mandated that you make an effort to try to integrate your communities\nThe president has said that the war on poverty is largely over a desire to reconcile with what you saw in St Louis\nYeah I'm not at all actually um when I was visiting various communities especially along north side\nPeople just pointing around saying hey look at this look at all these in the house is look at all these abandoned homes nobody is coming here and people are concerned about how they're going to make ends meet and that economic prowess and\nGrowth that Trump sees for America doesn't really reconcile with what I saw in much of\nThe city ... beach them as a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity Letitia thanks for your reporting Oh

Morris the only black woman in Vermont legislature dropped out of her reelection race because of racist on line threats and harassment\nBlack women also face extra hurdles when campaigning like gathering funding and national endorsements\nKimberly peeler Allen is here to talk about these issues and she's the co founder of higher heights for America and organization working to elect black women for public office\nKimberly thanks for joining us and it's a pleasure to be here what an interesting topic this is um let's talk a little bit about motivation right well I mean we were hearing this is a year if the woman and everybody wants to run for office but\nThere's one is particularly driving women of color more specifically black woman to run for office well I think it is um\nYou know this confluence of events that we are that we find ourselves in a black woman had been running and doing the work behind the scenes for generations and you're thinking back to like Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan you know women have been a black woman had been in the trenches\nAnd now there is this new sense of urgency we're seeing the attempts and in many cases the actual reality of the roll back so the last fifty years of progress\nAnd we're seeing that you know black women are saying I Can't let this happen to my community so I'm going to step up and run and it is um that combined with\nUh the electorate realizing that you know over eighty percent of our elected officials across the country are white and male\nAnd that is you know by no means represents the diversity in this nation and the electorate as saying you know we need to have some different voices around the table\nAnd these black women are speaking to my issues\nAre regardless of you know the fact that they're black or they can appeal to everybody and it has really been a great um catalyst for all of these women to run such strong primaries and you know we're really looking forward to some great pickups on November sex\nSo let's talk a little bit about that because there are some challenges specifically in and we know politics is is like any other industry right there are challenges as we mentioned to funding and and getting support here\nUm yesterday and the show we talked about how important black women are to the Democratic party they've been called the backbone of the Democratic party Ninety percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen and yet they still lacking representation in the party's leadership ...\nShouldn't have viability of black women candidates\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think black women candidates are thought of by the Democratic party as less viable because of who they are because they can't raise the money because they won't give them the support what is that about um I think that's exactly it ice higher heights who was born out of the notion that\nWe needed a space for a black woman a political home for black women and Glenda car and I we knew from our experience that the factors that make a black woman a viable candidate or not necessarily the same as our white counterparts\nAnd we know that by mobilizing our networks because that is what we do just you know to make life happen for so many of us\nAnd the volunteer effort and the word of mouth and then also be bringing our authentic selves or to the campaign trail has really been\nA a great factor in the successes so we've always looked at Kennedy to a walk in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm on bought and on boss we look at what kind of\nA volunteer structure they have\nWe look at a you know do they have enough money to reach their constituents we don't need you know the hundreds of millions of dollars that so many of these races costs but do you have the baseline of what it's going to take for you to reach your target voters and do you have a solid campaign plan\nAnd you know are you in line with issues that we believe will make sure that black women in their communities and their families thrive\nWe should also note that Nineteen of the black women who are running for the house are challenging incumbents here now that could work to their favor or not depending on what we talked about which is funding you know how often is the ability to raise money part of the viability of a candidate right because you mentioned you don't need hundreds and millions and millions of dollars but\nAre there specific barriers to fund raising that black women candidates face in particular\nYou well I think there is you know just unfortunately the um institutional wealth\nOr we haven't been here that long we've had a challenges to our communities that have not allowed us to amass a the the type of wealth that some of our counterparts have uh the fact that black women are making a sixty three cents on the dollar just you know from the jump you know we we need our whole dollar if we're going to be competitive\nBut I think it is also thinking through it's not just the the large checks but\nAh being able to mobilize our networks for those you know monthly five dollar contributions that add up over time\nAnd see those ah you know contributions as a strength because they're not just dollars but they're also voters and most likely volunteers and it's also a question of actually getting people to the polls I mean you can spend all the money you want and I think we saw that here in New York without a Alexandra Ocasio Cortez\nWho nobody thought you know this person was going to win and then she wins re ... people showed up at the polls how important is that for black women candidates absolutely it is a ... that is the deciding factor we have to show up and show out at the polls\nTo make sure that our voices are heard make sure that we have voices around the decision making tables that reflect our priorities and there's a lot of racist this interest in the midterms will be watching Stacey Abrams
