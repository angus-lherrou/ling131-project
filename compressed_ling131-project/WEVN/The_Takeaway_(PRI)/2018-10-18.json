to back World Series titles [noise]\nPitcher river does tuna may have lost the masters fans when he gave up that home run during Tuesday's close game the Astros are currently down three to one against the Boston Red Sox and the American league championship series\nBut as soon as plays on the team has also been questioned for reasons unrelated to his pitching since he joined the Astros last August in June major league baseball suspended as soon as Seventy five games for violating the league's domestic violence policy and while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in a trade from the Toronto blue jays\nThan the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area\nWhitney Macintoshes a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney absolutely thanks so much for having me so there's not a lot of information public right now about the OSU nah a domestic violence charge what do we know about it\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may uh in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim\nUh in that case then a a police report was filed but because it was in Canada or things are just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key whereas in the U.S we would probably know some details what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended\nA and eventually just about a over a month ago the criminal case was wrapped up with a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a restraining order situation in the U.S\nHe has a year of probation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lives in Mexico did not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no a reasonable expectation of connection um so that's where we stand the suspension has ended and uh\nYeah the the details are just a little fuzzier because we don't have that police report to refer to or an actual criminal trial that you know went under way so let's talk a little bit about ... a current domestic violence policy like what is that it's only been around for a couple of years um but it's ...\nThe case of tuna [noise] yes so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen I'm there have been a handful of investigations and suspensions to this point and no sooner was a the third highest suspension so it was a pretty significant\nA sanctioned it was the third or fourth one this year actually\nI'm most recently Addison Russell of the cubs was suspended forty games for a domestic abuse\nSo are there have been players suspended before and after you know he is not the first but again his situation is very specific because\nThere was a trade that was involved um but MLD doesn't necessarily um similar to other sports and as they do not necessarily wait until a criminal case has been completed they do their own investigation they speak to victims on their own time they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account\nUm an overall the process it a little bit\nA kind of like have seen this case it's a little bit um non transparent we don't have a ton of information about why sooner was Seventy five games out of Russell was forty or a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past few years we don't really know what I'm obese investigation\nConsists of and um so it's a little tough and it does make it uh it does open them up to speculation quite a bit\nEspecially and you see in a case here saying he's the third highest you know number of games he must have done something awful but we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky and players under the suspended out of the policy are as we've seen eligible to play in the postseason compared to players suspended for\nSteroids or performance enhancing drugs which are\nNot eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a tricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms there are some issues of transparency as far as how their investigations go about but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think of a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as they like it to\nThe Astros decided to trade to ghetto sooner while he was still suspended and I guess the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general manager said this quote did we take a risk no question\nAre there are people that are still upset about it no question will do whatever we can at this point supporting the relevant causes and he went on to say that it was soon actually makes the team stronger\nWhat do you make of that yeah I think it's a ... the way I've seen the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for a an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs did this with our oldest Chapman star closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago\nAnd it did when the world series and it worked and fans kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it with those tuna um the actual ... been a little bit more blatant about that's what we're doing um you know he he throws good pitches he's gonna win he could win at the world series\nWhen he what's interesting about this story is that the Astros now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that what is that purely for the optics of ...\nHaving gotten no sooner is that a real serious\nA campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR spin Jim ... owner of the Astros did openly admit kind of we now that we've tried to furrow sooner we want to make sure that domestic violence awareness is a ... in an important thing for the Astros foundation which has a thirty million dollar and down and\nI'm so again he kind of said the quiet part out loudly trading for domestic abuser\nNow we'd like to do the work in the community that hope hopefully makes us feel better about that it feels like they're trying to have it both ways it it does um the players have been saying oh he's a great clubhouse presence you know ... flew an H J Hinch Jim and manager of the team have kind of like\n... he's a he's a great player\nDonating I'm Around three hundred thousand dollars to local women's shelters and the Houston, Texas area in a partnership with the Texas council and family violence\nSo they put the work and they have cooperated but it is a little bit having

T alliance that I think is um allied a very intimately with Israel with strong support from the Trump Administration\nUm I think these players are hoping to rewrite the geopolitics and the political map if the middle east by pursuing a series of very aggressive policies toward their adversaries fundamentally rooted in strengthening authoritarian\nAllies in the region a crushing civil societies and um and and playing very hardball with um with other countries in the region\nDo you expect that all of these things could potentially lead to another uprising similar to what we saw in the Arab Spring\nI think we will to think that you know millions of people many of them young I'm with aspirations for a better future is simply going to accept to live under different forms of despotism forever just wishful thinking I think in many ways that really is the um ... bargain to many people in the west\nHave calculated on that these authoritarian regimes can simply keep things under control assuming that people will be too tired or two I'm disillusioned to resist and revolt of course with revolutions and revolts we never can predict when do happen but almost certain\nOf another ... to some form is inevitable\nWell and I well also you know the Arab Spring was in twenty ten twenty eleven were now in a very different moment um at least internationally the United states has a different president in a different administration I'm Wondering um what about that long standing relationship and support to the United states and Saudi Arabia have had\nA this isn't a Trump phenomenon solely this is something that the United states and Saudi Arabia have had for for quite some time do you think that ah that relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United states could be affected\nBy what we're seeing right now in the ground\nWell I think it's bound to be affected I mean you're absolutely right to um to suggest that this is simply not to be diminished Donald Trump the U.S Saudi relationship and more broadly the U. S. relation\nWorld War two where the United states effectively I'm struck up a series of alliances with 'em or autocrats and authoritarian regimes I'm hoping that they would preserve stability advance American interest\nIn this particular incident that we're talking about what ...\nThe United states and specifically President Trump has sort of played two sides of this coin on the one hand they're defending the Saudis they're saying they're regional partner on the other hand they're being confronted with more and more and more evidence just yesterday we heard there was an audio recording of\nA what could potentially be ... um last moments um and then that evidence is showing that this could in fact be a state sanctioned Saudi murder what type of danger could there be in continuing that alliance given this increasing evidence\n[noise] well the danger is that it's simply going to um um perpetuate a very um [noise] I'm odious regime in Riyadh that is responsible for a lot of the regional instability so I think the danger here that it's simply going to\nDeepen the instability in the region it's going to generate more anti American hostility it's going to embolden\nAutocrats and dictators around the world to see that at least this administration in Washington D. C.\nIs willing to go to bat apologize deflect criticism from the policies of authoritarian regimes so is going to have a lot of destabilizing consequences we've invested heavily in these regimes we've invested heavily in this particular crown prince hoping that he would be our savior\nAnd all the warnings that uh people were issuing with respect to this policy with respect to the this particular crown prince no one took a seriously and this is not just a Republican Trump problem this goes across the political spectrum and as I stated a moment ago as deep historical roots\nThis is the consequences of investing in authoritarianism and political tyranny and ignoring human rights and basic um questions of of of democracy and good governance\nAnd we also know that the Washington Post published a final opinion piece from ... last night um which they had received right before his death or disappearance\nAnd in it he writes about the need for free expression in the Arab world can you tell us what the role of the press and the media is in Saudi Arabia and how that impacts what people may or understand about what's happening in the rest of the region\n[noise] the role of the press and the media in Saudi Arabia is to effectively repeat\nThe propaganda oh the Saudi royal family I mean there is no independent press there is no free media that's one of the reasons why\nDo you want to show you had to leave and moved to the United states um and so the role as a media in Saudi Arabia is not that different from the rolls the media and any authoritarian regime in Saudi Arabia I think it's much worse because the the the nature and the level of the repression\nParticularly under this crown prince has moved in a much more ugly in repressive direction you know this final op ed that um that you're mall has written is worth pondering it's worse worth thinking about but it's\nIt's important that we think about this this concept in this idea of the free press\nIn relationship to U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia we haven't been pursuing a free press in Saudi Arabia we haven't been pursuing human rights we've been coddling dictators in death spots from the time that the United states emerged on the scene in Nineteen forty five it's been a consistent policy of downplaying these basic\nValues that we often espouse as being foundational to our own country at our own national identity but we rarely apply them to our foreign policy particularly in the middle east and I think we have to we have to figure out a way out of this um this is broken pattern of of policies that are I think not in the long term\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in your community was convenient locations throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think is at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock is here [noise]\nSupport for the takeaway comes from babble on language that teaches real life conversations in a new language is Spanish French or German novels tend to Fifteen minute lessons are available and the ... or online at battle the a B.
