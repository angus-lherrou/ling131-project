know that children [noise]\nYou know that children for twenty minutes so they come into our country\nThis is the takeaway I'm ... and we begin today with the news that the Trump Administration is considering once again separating children from their parents at the U.S Mexico border\nResponding to the backlash from the first time the administration tried this policy and then had to reverse it through executive order\nThey are now considering detaining families seeking asylum together for twenty days and giving parents the choice either have your kids stay with you in detention for months or years as the case makes its way through the process or allow the government to take your children to a government shelter\nLast week a report from Amnesty International fighting US Customs and border protection data show that more than six thousand so called family units were separated from April to August of this year that number is much higher than the original twenty five hundred reported\nIn an interview with Lesley Stahl from CBS is sixty minutes President Trump was asked if he would repeat the policy\nYou allow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that then what happens is people are going to pour into our control you gonna go back to that well we're looking at all\nImmigration laws 'cause they were they were laughing stock all over the world are you willing though I think you're saying you're it's under consideration all I Want all the laws change the job because I was just Leslie for coming into our country illegally\nJoining us to discuss this is Darryl in senior immigration reporter with box Darren thanks for joining us thanks for having me on what is the so called binary choice option that the Trump Administration is looking into such a\nBinary choice is between essentially indefinite detention and separation the way that it's been laid out by the post is that after the twenty or so days that families are currently allowed to be altogether and attention the parent would be given a choice between\nYou can wave your rights under the Florida settlement and we'll keep you together and detention until your asylum proceedings are done or second part of the binary choice you can wave your rights under the court settlement in the family separation case\nAnd your child will be taken from you and placed in an office of refugee resettlement facility what is clear from existing reporting is whether\nThat's going to be better tracked than it was under the first round of family separation or whether a parent would be essentially giving their child up for adoption as we've seen from the Associated Press and other outlets are reporting some of the children who were separated\nHave been a without the consent or

state\nMike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia after the disappearance and alleged murder of Saudi journalist ...\nOn October second because she'll be entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey and hasn't been seen since according to reports Saudi officials allegedly tortured and murdered and may have even dismembered the Washington Post columnist claims which the Saudis states strongly denies on\nFriday reports of merge that Turkish authorities have audio and video recordings confirming\nThat can show he was killed inside the Saudi consulate\nThose recordings have not yet been made public but now Saudi Arabia says Turkish officials can search their consulate\nMeanwhile US Senators are pushing the Trump Administration to consider sanctions on the Saudi Government and business leaders are pulling out of a future economic conference being hosted by the kingdom Sarah as these as a journalist covering human rights in the middle east Hi Sarah thank you so much for having me on\nSo if the Saudis have denied any involvement in the disappearance of ... and I'm so far that's been apps and any proof as far as we know\nA there was just a breaking news alerts that they are now allowing Turkish investigators into the consulate what's your sense on what's that could mean yeah that\nCertainly an interesting development however really remains to be seen how cooperative as Saudi officials may be and we have\nHad 'em out that officials all that on the premise is once before but it was very tightly controlled started more of a curated fewer than an investigation keep in mind that the Saudis have had almost two weeks to\nMake whatever preparations they might mean to you in order to ensure that this investigation\nUm wouldn't go favorably for them so it's perhaps a positive development by you know we should be definitely be skeptical whatever may arise from that is it\nSo of course President Trump of the world is watching to see what the United States a reaction would be President Trump was on sixty minutes this weekend and he said that there would be quote severe punishment if the Saudis were found to be involved with ... disappearance\nWould you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed would depends on what the sanctions or give you an example they ordering military equipment\nAutor Russia want her to China wanted if we wanted as we got it and we got all of it every bit of it\nThe question I have for you is what kind of punishment are we talking about he's sort of talked around sanctions are sanctions still on the table\nThat is definitely a matter of debate at this precise moment we've had some members of Congress saying that they would want\nTo go that far you know for the U.S that has such a strong and longstanding economic relationship with Saudi Arabia sanctions are treated sort of as the ultimate boundary of of the possible it's it's a red line for some people who\nTend to wanted to focus on a more incremental perhaps more cultural soft reprimand towards the Saudi Government whereas others\nSay that that is the only really effective way the only way to really convey the level of severity that they see in this case so I think on what everyone's really watching as the the threat that Saudi issued in response to some of these hands um which is threatening to raise the oil prices threatening to\nRetaliate um as far as their oil production goes so we'll we'll have to see 'em\nWhat risks our government is actually willing to take but oil on weapons sale there certainly are you know the meat and potatoes the foundation of our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nAnd you did speak with Jamal earlier this year what did he tell you regarding the Saudi state and the Saudi crown prince\n[noise] yeah absolutely I spoke with ... uh several times for a few pieces I was doing I'm On the escalating crackdowns the the growing um suppression of all all types of free speech and free expression in the kingdom\nOn ... on a really shared with me some of his concerns that I'm a well Saudi Arabia had never been a bastion of human rights are free speech um there had been a little bit of latitude a little bit of space for the press for academics and religious leaders to\nPerhaps differ with the royal family to a degree within some um you know pledge of loyalty to the Saudi royal family however under Mohammed bin Salman we saw an increasing pattern of preemptive strikes the crown prince was locking up people who had not necessarily criticized him at all but ... whom he just feared\nMight object right before he gave women the right to drive for example he locked up a lot of\nThe country's most conservative clerics in order to sort of head off any conservative critique and then at the same time he\nWas censoring 'em or arresting academics and intellectuals on the more liberal side sort of\nJust demonstrating and need to completely control the narrative from the top down as far as his reforms in his reputation and Jamal as a journalist really felt like he could no longer\nPractice his craft as a journalist with any integrity um many people are being asked to sign loyalty pledges he was receiving increasing pressure from the government and um he grew really disheartened with the regime he loved Saudi Arabia\nHe really expressed a lot of regret that he had felt the need to leave his family and his job and many many colleagues behind but he told me you know Saudi Arabia deserves better and this crown prince\nMain market um one thing may market a bright future for Saudi Arabia but without freedom of speech and freedom of the press that the really hollow promise\nSara as these as a freelance journalist focusing on human rights Sara thanks for joining the

alleging that the schools admissions policies discriminate against Asian American applicants spearheading the lawsuit as a conservative activist named Edward Blum was organized efforts\nTo end affirmative action before here's how he describes the problem\nIt's racial discrimination and it's a quota for the quarter today is against Asians much likes quarterback in the Nineteen twenties and thirties was against Jews the\nIssues surrounding this case have opened up divisions within the Asian American community we spoke to a couple of students [noise]\nMy name is Ken issue I'm a senior at Davidson College number writer for the federal it I'm an Asian American but to me you know the critical part of that is that I'm an American and I think that I Want to be looked at in on the basis of Michael ... and all the content of my character\nRather than the way the Harvard is looking at is an American a rating them poor personalities I'm reading the people that are less desirable into college strictly because of their race [noise]\nMy name is Sally ten I'm a current senior at Harvard College studying history and literature and studies of women's gender and sexuality Asian Americans are being used as a\nRacial wedge in a lot of ways as a way of propping up against other people of color and utilizing the quote unquote model minority net to perpetuate these ideas about who deserves to be in these institutions\nI'm personally for equal treatment of all racist regardless of your race or ethnicity I think that people should be treated on the basis of merit and opportunity I think that\nUm anytime it caused such a different kind of racial balancing positions thing by necessity usually involves turning away from people who were more merited and taking and people who are less qualified\nI truly believe that my admissions file my application\nCould not have been as\nCompelling as it ended up being for by admissions officer had I not been able to talk about my race in our really meaningful way along with my other identities as a child of immigrants as a first generation college student at someone who comes from a low income family it doesn't adjusted to all students including Asian Americans\nHuge tried to portray it as if we are\nA model and I grew up around Princeton New Jersey area so um there are a lot of people there who are very academic and very obsessed with college and so I think that when when you have that kind of environment and really doesn't help when school at Harvard basically says you and your application is not worth as much as\nAnother guy's application because it looks like you're trying to guard because it seems like you're not worthy based on characteristics that\nYou know we can't change better so\nDon't think they're the person on the campus who can deny\nHaving a diverse student body and a diverse campus I think that in fact the conversation has evolved to actually be more about how Harvard\nTo be doing more for it's good to do better recruiting get diversity within diversity thinking about Asian Americans as being the rise of multiple ethnic groups including Southeast Asians and in more recent immigrants and Pacific Islanders [noise]\nJoining me now to discuss the lawsuit against Harvard is Natasha worry coups and associate professor of education at Harvard University and author of the diversity bargain thanks for being here Natasha\nThank you for having me also with us in Studio in New York has watched shoe staff writer for the New Yorker watts thanks for being ... to be here soon as I said let's start with you or you're currently at Harvard University which is being sued in this case are you involved in this lawsuit in any way no I'm not\nTo tell us a little bit about how Harvard policy admissions work where does race factor in if it factors in at all\n[noise] so how has a holistic admissions policy which means that the admissions office upset a whole host of factors when deciding whether to admit students\nUm this includes of course academics but in addition to academics it's also looking at articulate her um talents that a student might have outside of the academics like\nMusical talent perhaps someone has done some pretty serious science research they are also looking at athletics and you know manning the sports teams\nI'm of course the legacy that are part of this and race is one of these factors particularly under represented groups African American Latin Latino Native American groups I'm kind of diverse uh make sure that those voices are part of the student body on campus to provide a diverse learning environment\nYou mentioned on the under represented groups who did not mention Asian Americans or legacy students that I'm Wondering why that was\nYes children of people who went to Harvard at some kind of ... get a kind of closer look they get an extra read and you know they do get a small leg up and uh in terms of Asian Americans university denies that their penalizing Asian Americans\nIn the admissions process and what the scientists are trying to do in this case is to tie this question of are Asian Americans penalized if he's if he writes\nTo our whites penalized speeds of the um underrepresented minorities I should say under the law there's a compelling state interest to give a boost to underrepresented minorities for this debris starting environment\nThe Congress is not true between you know when we're comparing Asian Americans to whites and admissions\nWell when it comes to you because you just wrote a big piece about this in the New Yorker you interviewed several Asian Asian American activists who actually are in support of the lawsuit can you give us a sense of why they feel that way why they stand there yeah I think\nThere's a lot of division within the Asian American community it might not be as great as is often reported but there is a very small very vocal group within was Chinese American immigrant population that is very much invested in notions of opportunity meritocracy\nAnd you know they often spoke about the American dream in a way that I think a lot of people who've been in America while don't necessarily sort of see is contracts we binding\nAnd it just sort of this perfect storm were booms really interested in changing the cultural conversation around affirmative action around race consciousness and a lot of these\nPredominantly I Would say middle class I'm fairly kind of well to do single issue Chinese American voters particularly in suburban areas they don't really experience the diversity that a
