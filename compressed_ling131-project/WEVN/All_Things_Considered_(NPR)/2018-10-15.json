and I'm Mary Louise Kelly Senator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of a DNA test that says there is quote\nStrong evidence she has Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations this was an attempt to quiet a controversy a controversy that has dogged at war and for years\nAnd it comes as the Massachusetts Democrat ... a run for president in twenty twenty NPR's Asma Khalid is on the story and she is in the studio now either pay [noise]\nStart with exactly ... what did Elizabeth Warren released today\nShould she released the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos ... day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry\n... you know in addition to this DNA Analysis warning also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking hurt mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and since then yet from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she calls ... their DNA researcher and puts him on the line\nYou did five five segments with Native American ancestry with very high confidence or we believe the error rate is less than one of them\nNow the president likes to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts of what we have a Native American ancestry your bedroom\nSo you you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nAnd can also here or at least who one of members of the intended audience that video is the president himself a lady responded to although he\nHas and no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of ... at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were to bait to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said\nGive me a million dollars for your favorite charity\nFor trouble if you take the test that shows your your [noise]\n[noise] so merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up ... million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard or the late ... and the war in with after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned that she is I I run for president herself and\nTwenty twenty I think that's a really realistic eyes at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November and this is really about what what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve at that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHis taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty races going to kick off pretty much just in his mid term\nVery briefly has quieted all of this ...\n... no not at all I mean I can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered question All right so that is

Hi Mara Hi Mary Louise ... wrote killers this is quite the turn of phrase do we know if the president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly what\nWe're not sure about that but he certainly is offering an alternative theory of the case although he did not explain how road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and um\nKilled somebody in there but I think you see that his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times that the king flatly denied it he firmly denied it and we've seen this pattern before when he took Latimer pollutants quote strong denials that Russia didn't interfere\nIn the twenty sixteen elections he even offered an alternative theory of the case back then when he said someone weighing four
