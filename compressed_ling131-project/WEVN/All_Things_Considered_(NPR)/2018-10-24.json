Chang and act of terror that is what New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is calling a suspicious package sent to CNN in New York\nStudios were evacuated this morning because of that package which was reportedly addressed a former CIA director John Brennan\nBut CNN was not the only target authorities discovered a number of suspicious packages including when sense to Hillary Clinton and former President Obama they came on the heels of another suspicious package sent a billionaire George Soros earlier in the week\nNPR's Ryan Lucas has been following all of these developments and joins us now Hey Ryan or other\nOK so a lot of moving parts here all day where do things stand now what do we know\nThis point in time authorities are talking about uh six suspicious packages and\nHome in New York another to Obama uh here in Washington DC the secret service intercepted both of those during routine screening overnight they were identified as time has potential explosive devices are and then this morning a third suspicious package was sent CNN's office in New York City right or on the border of Central Park\nThat one was addressed to Brennan who of course was Obama's CIA director in a CNN evacuated the building a in why pd take off the streets called in the bomb squad and the package was contained in taking away\nRight okay so those packages you can't describe it the ones grabbing the headlines but there were more packages that we know about tell us about\nThat was well another suspicious package was sent to Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder at his law firm here in Washington the address was wrong a package bounce back to the return address which was for democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz Florida a law enforcement officials are at her office in Florida dealing with a suspicious package there\nUS Capitol police say they intercepted another package that was addressed to democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters are and then remember today's packages of as you said these if not the first time that we've seen this this week on Monday the potential explosive device was discovered at the home of George Soros who of course billionaire investor big supporter of democratic causes\nRight so what are authorities saying about the devices in these packages\nWell a senior law enforcement official in New York described the devices pipe bombs I said that they are the device sent to Soros was nearly identical to the one cent to Clinton and Obama\nAre we know the most at this point about the package that was sent to CNN officials say it contained a potential explosive devices and a a suspicious white powder that hasn't been identified in law enforcement officials that I've spoken with\nThey did not have any information about other packages containing white powder so it seems at this point in time only the one that sent to CNN did I'm now all of these potential explosive devices are being sent to the FBI for analysis and the powder as as well\nSo the obvious connection between all these package is at least on the surface is that the people targeted are all high profile Democrats how what are authorities saying about that link\nIt certainly is the link on the surface that we can all look at and say yeah these are all Democrats uh as far as investigators are saying at this point in time or they don't want to talk about what the investigation looks like and what that might mean\nFor friday sunshine highs around fifty in the south around forty in the north and looking ahead to Saturday I have a chance of rain and snow

[noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Elsa Chang\nWe're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt suicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life\nConducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of a valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there is only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hurt a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboys stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a bear bootstraps mentality and\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns\nSupport for any shipyards live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustained excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you online at or dash Reno dot com\nKids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts news sources of strength suicide prevention program\nAnd she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nOf these are not junior psychologist but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help a lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grade [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to roll\nOver all the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friends were our friends help them through tough times lily points up to her and the crowded wall\nSupporting them keeping that positive [noise]\nBecause I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just stuff like that and see what they're going through so they don't feel like getting\nReally has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength ... with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad's suicide\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope I don't mind sharing it what's going on in\nGrand Junction represents a broader shift in thinking and the public health world the ideas that you go way quote upstream\nAnd try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband to suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think is incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was kept in ...\nTore in a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad a competitive bike racer he was a community leader seen as a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or lily leaves dad and uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Moore says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super\nPowerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing the things that need to change\nKids are catalysts to change Morris says you start there and hopefully the
