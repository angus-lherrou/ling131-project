Shereen Marisol Meraji in Georgia allegations of voter suppression or grabbing headlines and the tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivists are suing cans because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications have been put on hold the majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this so we called that mark nice he he's a government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program\nThat's driving with All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nThe law last year that's known as the exact max law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia\nWhere did this law come from\nIt was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... come fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last\nYear and very quickly after that settlement with the state\nThe Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where the civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed into state law\nNow the secretary of state's office says other states have this\nKind of law including Florida and in Florida and the way a federal court upheld their law\nAnd activists are saying that this lies disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nBrain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does she have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to and the ...\nHis opponents say that Brian ... is\nPart of this process that secretary of state he's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these voters on\nPending lists and we have seen Georgia Pass a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections work as the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing ...\nElections and enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of election processes are local decisions and says secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote and follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported that Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including well over two hundred thousand new voters just in the may primary election\nWhat's the mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are\nCracking down on voting rights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the words that Brian Kemp use\nThat with my ... of the Atlanta Journal constitution Mike thanks so much\nA sure thing thank you\nIt's time

[noise] what are you about Twenty years old age the use of my God I think of candies in my purse [laughter]\nAnd Sarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program thank you for having me and us [laughter] so excited about meeting here [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are\nYou know there's a a man who's object to find women who is a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never want while I'm actually on the clock but yeah and you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every\nTime I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst than value are determined by\nParents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOf the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself\nBeing really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have ... on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nA woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... burn more but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was\nCulture but in hip hop and there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are\nNegotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quite right or I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I have a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that\nI Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity so having accented English actually does means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love kind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual and us how to do is when do\nUnited Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material\nOn during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution or commercial sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said\nBut he got cracking good job or she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so\nYou know I really try to set my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American\nAnd we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of e pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is in Utah white you busy that yeah I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity in America and in our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what you told us\nI spent the first twelve years of my life thinking that I was a little white girl and when I found out that it wasn't it wasn't just revelation it was an identity crisis\nSo really I think it's kind of a lack of identity that ties transnational adopt these together\nThe narrative about my adoption was really centered around my mom being a savior", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Keene", "day": "13"}
