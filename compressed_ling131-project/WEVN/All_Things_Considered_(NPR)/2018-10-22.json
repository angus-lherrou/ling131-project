wouldn't notice just to make of a vocal a little cleaner and clearer and more on pitch\nThis song brings the auto tune front and center here those modifications\n\nAnd it could easily have just been a gimmick instead auto tune became a very prominent tool in a lot of pop R B and hip hop production\nTo me auto tune sounds sort of like digital stretching are flexing your sharing a a singer kind of slide up and down the register\nIn a in a way that doesn't sound natural but auto tune can amplify an expression of passion in or emotion in a singer\n\nI think of a song like hide and seek by the

creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the buzz around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome to kill a pleasure to be here I'll say how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel disarm where he literally took and then you're in oil and hang it on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered\nWe're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it seems like a technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability\nOf a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really I tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price that in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the code hers who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the quarter is\nThe collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of are the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work has gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off\nAnd so this is a first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited and numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the
