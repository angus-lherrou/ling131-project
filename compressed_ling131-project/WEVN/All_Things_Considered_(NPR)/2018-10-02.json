B. R. dot\nYou hear a lot of stories each day on New Hampshire public radio uh important information scene setting audio there was gathered out in the field scripts were written editors review the story and confirm the facts engineers made sure it sounded perfect there's a lot that goes in to every story\nThat you here in New Hampshire Public radio that's that's how the news comes together that's how the sausage is made one story at a time and public radio funding\nSo but the judge is already have to complete a pretty thorough and very long questionnaire is it surprising at the White House didn't touch any of these allegations of sexual misconduct and Brett Kavanaugh's case\nTrue that judge candidates gas a bunch of questions known in shorthand as the sex drugs and rock and roll Russians things like did you abuse alcohol or drugs did you have a wrap sheet what about financial improprieties but those questions usually started age Eighteen and go forward\nIn this allegation by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh happened when he was Seventeen years old\nTo be clear Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct but there were plenty of hints about his use of alcohol from that high school yearbook injury to his fraternity at Yale which was known for rock is parties to his own speeches once he got on the federal appeals court here in Washington DC\nWords like what happened at Georgetown Prep stayed at Georgetown Prep time in a speech when he reminisced about a baseball outing at Yale where people stumble drunk off the bus in the pre dawn hours\nI mean what could what is happening with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation lead to changes in the way the FBI conduct background investigations in the future you think\nThe lawyers I've talked to have pointed out the system has adapted in the past for instance in the Nineteen nineties\nQuestions about paying taxes for landscapers and babysitters came up after some nominee right for cabinet positions ran into trouble boys in gray who handle judge nominations for President George H W. Bush told me that the I might go back deeper into nominees background into high school for instance\nBut he says when it comes to allegations of sexual assault the situation\nSure scary it's thought that one allegation was low backup no or a third of the oil was to go home there's nothing for you choose to look up to ... new disapprove of it\nNow it's important to say that supporters of Christine Blasey Ford say she does remember several key details about that night in Nineteen eighty two and then another accuser Deborah Ramirez has come forward with concerns about Kavanaugh at Yale\nI'm Brett Kavanaugh he has made it clear that he has already been through six separate background checks for government jobs over the years do we know of any of his background checks revealed allegations for anything that's been mentioned so far we were they caught in any of those reports\nThose background check reports are secrets on the White House and the Senate Judiciary committee led by Republicans\nHave said they did not capture a whiff of sexual impropriety when it came to Brett Kavanaugh and we do know that there are some clues that Kavanaugh was asked about his finances maybe some other allegations in a private hearing what the Senate Judiciary committee this year but that hearing has remained mostly private\nI reached out to Ron Klain who helped President Bill Clinton that judges Clinton says there could be another issue the White House counsel's office under Donald Trump is understaffed and they've been pushing through judges had a record pace\nI Wonder if the bakery is just too many cakes and maybe they're not getting the attention they deserve\nBy contrast round cleans has President Clinton stop to all the other judges while he pushed through Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court but judges are central to Donald Trump's legacy and his mainly pleasing his political base so I don't expect to see a lead up there in this case All right That's NPR's Carrie Johnson thanks carrying my pleasure [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered support for NPR comes from this station and from the main office of tourism offering travelers and opportunity to explore and discover their very own main thing to be inspired be original and be yourself at visit main dot com [noise]\nFrom T.
