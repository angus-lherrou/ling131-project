in China the actual mother boards will be built in China\nChina basically makes the vast majority of all technology in the world today it's all been off shored and most of it has gone to China\nAnd governments have long pointed out that this is a risk because if the country allows its spies to mess with that process it's a major threat but companies always assumed that that's too valuable to China to mess with\nThe what the story tells us is in fact at least when the targets are valuable enough for specific enough they're going to be willing to do that to the\nCritical question of who did this you quote sources you point to a Chinese military unit has her at China denies that they have done this that they have anything to do with it how confident are you based on your reporting that this was trying to\n[noise] well that's certainly what the US government has assessed it to be and they assess it well U.S intelligence U.S intelligence what's right and I started with very high confidence\nAnd it's interesting and when we asked China's foreign ministry for ... a lot of times they'll say things like you're crazy we note that nothing about this their response with a little more nuanced and protect stolen environment we're in now basically said\nWe are a victim of these kinds of attacks to and you know they're right with the U.S government it's very very good at these kinds of hardware attacks and on a subtle way that the message that there was a deliberate was duck the conscious on us if you guys want to talk about very sophisticated hardware tax you have to talk about what you do as well\nYou're citing sources and U.S intelligence and I want to push you on this because some of the company's caught up in your reporting a ... which include Amazon which include apple which include super microbes they dispute summaries of your report and you've got their full statements on your website\nThey say they didn't respond they basically said nothing like this ever happened when you give me a sense of how many officials you talked to who were informing your reporting I'll give you some sense of the cluster of ah sources 'cause that's really important so we had\nSeveral sources inside the U.S intelligence community we had several sources inside law enforcement we've had sources inside the the other parts of the U.S government but we also more importantly had sources inside the companies who where these chips were found\nThe interesting thing about apple and Amazon is they are two very big very valuable companies but they also have pretty good security the fact that they found these chips was amazing in itself\nNow companies going to be responsible for what they what they want to say but based on our sourcing and the way it was layer from so many different places including inside of the companies were really confident that we have the story down so what are the implications of this\nWell they're ... they're they're they're really large economic and national security that's right in part because\nThe global economy is built on sort of global outsourcing trade model\nAnd again especially when it comes to technology China is a huge player and that and the implications of this are of companies now have to think well do I have to worry about what's being put in the technology that's being manufactured how do I try and counter that is it should I go someplace else and make things\nI mean it's a it's a really big hard issue to solve\nA for a lot of companies a lot of companies the reason they operate and as cheaply and can sell products that she believes that can is because many of those profit products are made in China they have to rethink the entire model you get a sort of a tidal wave of decisions that could impact the

into sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd you would never guess that Democrats and Republicans are reading the same report Democrats say it is incomplete Republicans say on the country and we're going to speak next to one of those Republican Senator Mike rounds of South Dakota senator rounds welcome\nThank you very much appreciate the opportunity to visit\n[noise] let me start with a yes or no question do you believe what the FBI has produced represents a complete and thorough investigation\nI Do it's simply the next step there's been six earlier ones this is the seventh in this particular case they went back and we didn't try their hands we just simply said you go back into the supplemental based on what a group of Republicans who had concerns with expressed\nThat they wanted to learn more about they talked about the specific incident itself at about other allegations they went through and lifted those out they actually interviewed I Believe ten individuals and and made eleven report\nOkay that you're adding to our information there 'cause my information was that they had interviewed nine individuals so if you've seen it maybe they're up to ten\nOkay I think it was ten total what should they contacted ten individuals nine individuals participated in one declined to participate didn't want to participate\nBut let me ask you about two people who they did not interview because this is raising a lot of questions for Democrats they didnt interview Brett Kavanaugh or Christine Blasey Ford\nWas because they both went through literally hours and hours of testimony before the Judiciary Committee both of them have actually had reviews before and so the the FBI had their choice as to who they wanted to interview and when\nAnd they decided not to interview either one didn't feel that they needed to interview either one however both were allowed if they wanted to to offer additional supplemental information no one stopped them from doing any supplement that they wanted to offer\nLet me put to a point made by one of your colleagues in the Senate Dianne Feinstein who was of course the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee she spoke to reporters this morning here's what she said\nIt's simply not credible to say that public testimony in last week's hearing is a substitute for interviews by FBI agents\nNot only to senators lack the expertise of FBI agents we were only given five minutes to questions judge Kavanaugh\nSaid Iran's does she have a point senators were only given five minutes to question Kavanaugh and ...\nThat's five minutes per individual with a grand total of probably eleven on the Republican side and Ken on the on the Democratic side and furthermore all of them offered literally multiple opportunities to ask questions specifically of each of them\nAnd I think in the case of judge Kavanaugh he literally responded to more questions in writing than any other Supreme Court justice although a lot of\nInformation has of course come to light sense and some of his written responses came and let me let me ask you this basic question how is it not in everyone's interest especially judge Kavanaugh's if he wants to clear his name for the FBI to given to be given the space and time too\nA man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath chat letting ten joins me now Hi there how are you married we I I'm All right thank you I your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released her statement this past Sunday I've just summarized it they're so let me get straight to what\nYou did with this information\nYou ended your statements saying you would go to the FBI and tell them what you\nDid you uh yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand the character's bases that they allowed\nSo you felt that this form did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I we're by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think once you live in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or what has taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nEight point twenty W.
