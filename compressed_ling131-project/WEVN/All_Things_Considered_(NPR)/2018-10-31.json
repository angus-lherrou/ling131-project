disagree\nThose talking points are being used to discredit women and to weaponize this issue just simply for partisan gang\nAttorney Deborah Katz says she ran straight into it when she represented

today tell us about what you saw\n[noise] yeah I was as that on the U.S as a ... it's an amphibious shit as a big flight deck and the U.S Marines were actually launching heavy trucks on huge Hubbard craft and wish it was really striking Ari [noise]\nIt was in the middle of a fjord snow capped mountains or they were what they were trying to do is to get vehicles on shore to support thousands of troops in war games of south of here tomorrow\nNow yesterday we saw jets ship's tanks from Germany the U.S Britain and Norway oil and lots of other countries all coordinating a mock assault on the shoreline you\nWhy is NATO mobilizing in such a big way right now\nYou can't ignore the context NATO spent many years is is we all knew focused on counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be re focusing more on its roots back you're in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defend the country that's been attacked by an unnamed invaders what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country is attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume it's fictitious invaders Russia\nAn earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the east and and now it seems to NATO's during\nThese huge military maneuvers by now\nLike we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength I was on the ship today speaking with us Admiral James logo he's head of NATO joint forces command in Naples, Italy and he said this is one of the messages\nWe can no longer expect to operate in the area of the north Atlantic with a few hundred so we may be challenged and so uh if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nSo whatever all so go saying is you know if anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been for about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he's publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy five hundred Marines here I was talking to you and Stoltenberg he's the NATO secretary general he says there's a difference between the political rhetoric here and actually the troops on the ground\nWhat we see is done to the United states is increasing its presence military presence in Europe would more forces more exercises more pre positioned equipment for the first time they're also use Marines here in Norway\nIs with the message here is the United states is still very very engaged in NATO\nThat's NPR's Frank Langfitt joining us from Norway thanks very happy to do it or a\n[noise]\nAll things considered as a production is NPR News which is solely responsible for the

B. R. I'm Peter below\nIn New Hampshire second congressional district candidates in mclane Custer and Steve Negron are busy making their final cases to voters\nTomorrow we'll hear a story about how congresswoman Custer is navigating the political waters as an incumbent Democrat this mid term today an HBO reporter Jason moon joins me to talk about her Republican opponent Steve Negron hey Jason Hey Peter\nSo we've had a Mr Negron on the air a number of times this campaign season and I think by and large we can say he's a pretty conventional GOP candidate when it comes to his policy positions pro small government socially conservative supportive of the president but you spent some time with him on the campaign trail how's he tried to stand out to voters\nWell first I Would say the ... that really is the challenge for him making himself stand out are right now polls show that many voters just don't seem to know a lot about Steve nigger on I'm appalled from St ... college for instance shows Seventy percent of voters in the second district have no opinion of him\nSo that sort of a hill he has to climb and it's especially steep because he's facing an incumbent has been in office for six years\nNow so far rather than focusing on big policy ideas or attacking his opponent neurons been focusing on his biography and I spoke with last week and he sort of laid out that key parts of that biography that he's focusing on\nThey come from a different perspective and I really think I'd come and it causes them the other party a little bit of anger I Am Hispanic as a minority I'm I'm a veteran I Am a small business owner ah I've been very involved in my community so you know I'm just they're going to the streets\nSo that's really the Steve Negron pitch in a nutshell there and he mentions too specific aspects of his biography that I think he's been stressing the most\nIs Hispanic roots and his military service and we've heard him talk about these things before yeah let's start with his Hispanic heritage on the ground often leads with that fact and I mean literally lean to it that he gave opening statements in Spanish here at the end H. B. R. forum and also at another forum sponsored by the Arab ...\nAnd I just like to say I'm In Spanish if I may I build on Seattle's gets on down though you're saying but I Love which I didn't put as many things which is that I get\nBy the way that translates to to all the older folks who are listening I Will always fight for your benefits and that and the ... grandfather was from Mexico his grandmother was from Puerto Rico and Ron himself even spent a good chunk of his childhood from ages tend to Seventeen growing up in Spain and he actually told me a story about that\nThat the dictator Francisco Franco was still in power\nI was with my grandmother in a young man's those emerges from the little local plaza in the time we were living in\nAn Franco head of state police cola ... they're called the ... civil that I'd want to go see and they just lived there for keeping in right there is running across the the thing they killed him just shot him dead you know I'm asking my grandmother what ... what is it happened is that because if people don't have freedom says is why\nAnd so all of this is a really important part of the grounds pitch to voters that you know coming from an immigrant family being bilingual having lived in an authoritarian country\nIt all gives them a perspective on issues like say immigration that his opponent doesn't have\nFor so obviously a unique personal story but when it comes to his positions on immigration they're fairly standard for a Republican candidate right\nYes I think that's absolutely fair to say you know he'll often talk about there being a right way to come into the country in a wrong way and that enforcing immigration laws are a matter of national security\nAnd the second area he focuses on his his military service how did he talk about that with voters\nWell he likes to say that his family has a combined a hundred and nine years of military service uh Fifteen of those years come from his time in the air force and the ... campaign held a series of roundtable on veterans issues recently\nI tagged along to one at an American legion post in Lebanon and I have to say no problem is certainly in his element there are swapping stories with the vets using lots of military references\nAfterwards I spoke with Stephen Armstrong a vet who sat in on the round table and he says he left feeling like everyone gets it\nIt's good to have people that are concerned about veterans and he'd be him being a veteran himself he has a real good idea of you know and like you said how many years is the same family members have been veterans you know you need someone to someone to help stand up got the you know of ...\nAnd ... standing up for vets in terms of policy means providing more options for veterans to access healthcare outside the VA system and he also says that his first piece of legislation if elected would be to create a nationwide green alert system which would be like amber alerts but for veterans in crisis\nOkay so Negron has been focusing heavily on his Hispanic roots in his status as a veteran but key question here isn't gonna work I mean it hasn't gotten him all that much attention so far has a\nYeah I mean who knows but ah the polling so far hasn't been a great sign for him in terms of whether or not this type of messaging is getting through\nAnd you know there are a lot of things at play here are like the fact that hasn't been able to raise that much money to help him get his name out there you know he's not running TV ads for instance\nUm but one thing that I've been curious about is how much his style of campaigning is a factor and all this uh he's he's very polite in his messaging he refers to everyone is sir or madam even the reporters I doesn't often go on the attack against congresswoman costs are in fact she recently called him a gentleman\nNow I Will say that during last night's debate on WMU or he was a little more aggressive but I think that's the outlier in in a in terms of the overall campaign\nAnd I just wonder if that understated style is part of what's preventing him from breaking through in this political atmosphere which today seems so dominated by you know spectacle win over the top rhetoric well\n... eighty eight point three W E ... age Hanover in Ninety One point three W E n keen Ninety point seven W E v the forum when I was seven point one W E v J Jackson Ninety nine point five W E the F\nCalled brook Ninety point three and W.

Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports\nOne problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things that means for the United states\nWe are the economic and the entire world what I mean the leaders of countries the first thing that invariably is Mr President so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut this is only a comedy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting\nThe end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're an fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they're selling it and buying dollars\nAnd ... says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand\nMeanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker the strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe

not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his account and credit cards had been

one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew\nOr on him when he turns up with all of our own stores and we must be working in a semi industry as I did a no up their\nLoudly

how to this very bizarre phenomenon that we call goes\nBut if he were around between Eighteen Seventeen and Nineteen oh five\nThere is a good chance you'd say New Orleans was haunted by death an epidemic here's the yellow fever virus could wipe out up to ten percent of the city's population it was spread by mosquitoes and in the summer of Eighteen fifty three it killed nearly eight thousand people\nThe virus earns New Orleans the nickname crop all this city of the dead and it wasn't a pretty way to die\nVictims experience John just so they sort of turned yellow\nThat's Katherine all the various she's a professor at Stanford who studies the history of yellow fever she says yellow fever would lead to chills Natasha headaches fever convulsions to leery um all the various says it was a disease that turned holy men away from\nGod even pious victims scream prevented ... at the end neared\nAbout half of people who got yellow fever would die from it you might think all this death with
