Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan either\nLet's start with the big sticking point so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no a Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this as a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat said the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they've said that uh they do want a full investigation they made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive ... investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly\nUh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in his background investigation that said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they want to the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct\nThat was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope were almost inevitable a on this question of senior a set of ... pointed comments at Seventy Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week that includes Kavanaugh's friend mark judge\nA gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations

Kavanaugh that Julie sweat Nick\nAnd then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legend events in question one of course is Kevin O's friend mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI of his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nIn the last twenty four hours a former friend up Kevin O's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man uh this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kavanaugh drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale says Kavanaugh was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nA but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kevin did not behave that way they don't match or those allegations don't match the
