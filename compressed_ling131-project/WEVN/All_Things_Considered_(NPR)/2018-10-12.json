Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone and that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today where\nYou know these are serious somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they were better than communities that we're right near the center places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe so when we drove into the mud bruise your buddies solving we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen what those other communities you know the the trees are mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't\nI think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it uh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses resist in rubble some it already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took you nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now and just single lane but that said there is no a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in ... no power no very limited cell service and no outside help you\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the heart of the oyster industry they've got fishing going on there are a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... all the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi whole they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most votes escaped major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage are working to rebuild and be back in business

this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nToday in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell he's passed around a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and brunch and was caught up in that basically\nUh he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless\nBut he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses you adjust to fight against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that incensed a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways brunch and was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean\nThere were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey and of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get brunch released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they love each sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in your restaurant\nQuestion is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's just church that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering it thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra during the clerics are to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing his doubles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a well luckily there was a second clue a note lasted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be adjusted\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers\nSo presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn corn oil and salt whoa\nHow naive to think that's all that's in a bag of Frida is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like Fritos\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ...

hey I was going there good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they aren't just one clear and been quarter\nAnd yoga broker after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had the elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so I'll come with a big part of the appeal\nWith typing in with the players today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball is really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much pull do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer\nYeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year and like you had about ... percent of the week wearing the issue was while okay step in and combat that is pretty common bond okay you do have they do have a huge budget and allowing for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with it all started to end or his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball shoe business\nIncredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases the guys that were dropped ... you know we're both pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's got a chance to check up on Instagram they are\nUnlike any other brands and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people are upset that kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue rather than what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stuff in terms of high school kids they're watching what to look through Oregon and they're really cut immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and listening to the highlights on his grandmother and like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys at the sun\nThey have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's why this huge as the brand of starting out you know I think the brand itself is only about a couple of hundred thousand or so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their ... with the news that they don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that goes can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages so so that's going to be pushed for sure\nNick DiPaolo covers the athletic

things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know said Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation\nOf Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro birds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so\nAnd what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse\nI actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though is an acknowledgement by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop ... role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think that the people have Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence credit stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused often don't come\nForward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nYou hit the nail on the heads so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to\nHold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and\nSeeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable in law enforcement plays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania's state attorney general thank you very much for joining us\nThank you some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed a federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled the critical moment in that probe\nMoron laws when we succeeded which was first in history to get the courts to promote the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because the committee would have had real difficulty and doing its workers ... hadn't gotten all the brown\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven that document contained in detail list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWe called the road map in our office because it was just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of stuff from the Watergate special that was very interesting but what I asked you to load that was set up to the house I they ... they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but\nThere's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nTwenty first century variation of the Silk Road is something that the lower team destroyed likely considered\nSales boss on the Watergate team was James corals who now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already signaled he would fight

stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed is gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this it's\nVery unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush\nThe president and its ministry should an often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy but maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like who's read or it doesn't but since uh the Clinton Administration came in they decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve run for the country\nOn monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the sad from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing\nAnd a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself or with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and held sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAre no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information\nUsing the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or\nI think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see an economic riskier\nGiven who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate non partisan institution that's acting in their best interests but\nYou're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the\nMan I think it could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill trying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald ... the former vice
