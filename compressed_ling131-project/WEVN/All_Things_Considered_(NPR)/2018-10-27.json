Michelle Martin broadcasting today from WHYY in Philadelphia we are of course following the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh today we will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia you may have hurt other colleagues from NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling\nAnd talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight and Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of that and blue wall from ...\nThe Democrats thought what secure the White House for them and all of those states went for Trump on election night now though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house so we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk\nPeople we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not and we've been asking all of them watch and are on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we ask WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and allies say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do with a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about\nAnd what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of this state mean for the last six years Pennsylvania ... have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shape and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis will challenge last year and a lawsuit there was aimed not at federal court where some of the gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map and unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can see that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle character assassination if you have ever missed a tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money\nIt's been one of the most expensive campaigns in the country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but was also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists name Scott Wallace who's never run for office before and he poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary are not just the policies that are being twisted around and then turned toward the one percent of the corporations and away from the Ninety nine percent\nBut just a moral tone of our country I've got three kids\nTo raise a kid and the atmosphere this influence coming from the White House it's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assault on the media\nThe assaults on the courts and the rule of law and Leo beyond our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth it still is under assault\nAnd I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and\nAll very next [laughter]\nThe on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue\nThat ties all of us together is money in politics my opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate pac money I refuse to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money on this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business\nFrom getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending\nWhen you want gun control the amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests stops every single thing that the people want\nYou know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district on expensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with\nExpectations comes with strings attached and so that's how the candidates votes\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem\nIs the people who don't vote at all they are not crazy when they think that their vote their voice is going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in your campaign\nIs he's huge I mean I I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate the tone so he's\nNot on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging\nHe goes around the country saying vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election\nAnd of course interest is much higher in a presidential election and the reality is\nThis is the first chance to voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing and the last thing I think anybody wants to see is ... doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me ask you about both of the things that got lost just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that\nWell Scott Wallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help it's Patrick because he doesn't have the family money and all of the negative\nAspects of it what about the Trump factor we talked about that is is is that the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about the might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump\nOr the feeling that that Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose him have to stop I think it really is what's it's the most motivating thing I see\nSo we sat Democrat Scott Wallace is challenging the incumbent Republican Bryant that's Patrick fitzpatrick is the former FBI agent the only form an FBI agent currently\nTrump on certain issues such as the way the president has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the two thousand sixteen elections now accomplished artist Patrick invited us to meet him at his parent's house in a suburb of leather town where he grew up as the youngest of eight siblings and despite being the beneficiary of a lot of this so called independent expenditures the Daily Beast just talked about\nFlowing into the race and his behalf it's Patrick said that he agrees with his Democratic opponent that there's too much

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there helping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here with us now to tell us more hello Ryan either [noise]\nFirst of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point\nAh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today or here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nAnd over the next several days and weeks we will look at everything and the suspects life is home his vehicle is social media and his movements over the last several days\nOh Joan says officers were covered in assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are gonna searches home they say that they'll take precautions in case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point or that the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but then of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has call this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off yes attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges a in this case he says that there's no place for hatred and violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district to Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those sort of charges are going to entail\nCould just tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight and in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a a former federal prosecutor tells me that is likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime with eleven people killed or that the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been used in in quite some time\nBut treating this shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof of who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina\nThe federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just as briefly as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there are there's a lot of work to be done and then of course\nMedia history there already accounts for reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiments a and the alleged shooter in this case was of course eleven in custody so possibly uh looking to question him\nThat is NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to us thank you\nAnd once again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this in a week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race\nAnd pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility they told us they hope for more unity\nAnd that is a message that might have special residents in Gettysburg the site of an ethics civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three one of the country's bloodiest from within fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days\nBut now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there have been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach\nBringing people of different political views together it's called politics fats and stability Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded the group and twenty Seventeen Darcy Meyer also a Democrat joined a group to her friendship with Tom sent and Republican Chad collie is also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty sixteen in previous years before that was very politically involved I was vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally\nDuring the twenty sixth in campaign a saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways\nAnd uh it encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so I resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the aisle\nIt sounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had I it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who have been calling for something like this lawyer John cases in Ohio or maybe Joe Biden you could do the same argument on residents house ranch of former governor of Pennsylvania for sixty of homeland security\nBut you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully car and came up with a structure for that ... what about you\nIs this something that was kind of a hunger within you and now no really\nI um I have always been pretty staunch Democrat I that's where I live pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive\nI never really thought about how important it was to bridge the divide until I got involved I think that\nRealizing that that there is valid points to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find is has just on a real eye opening experience for me\n... what did you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish\nWas hoping that we could come to understand each other more and I I'm very convinced as Darcy just said that there are valid points on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue voter\nBut I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of like the story of the blind man and the the elephant which um I don't know if you're

was the surprise at the civility of the conversation that made me stay I tend to be a fairly quiet person who doesn't express myself very well and a group situation and so I don't like", "show_name":
