evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they can\nCreated by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word that kind of look like ... in bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing and it's all good morning from the perspective on main alive or not\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks\nThat means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\n... felt Sean I still feel

this\nMORNING EDITION weekday mornings from five until nine on an H. P. R. and streaming live at an H. P. R. dot org\nFor twenty million this is all things considered a New Hampshire public radio by Peter below libertarian candidate for governor Gillette uh Jarvis says she likes that business taxes have been dropping in New Hampshire and as governor she says she would put in place a plan for new businesses that would allow them to pay no taxes on their business profits for their first year\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually ended up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where everybody ended up throwing plates and each other in person left to you in very bad Dutch and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nA immediately you'd have checks on old goods coming in and also the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that will quickly to huge queues the ports coming into person\nAnd very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out of ... trees were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very tail sicken damaging EPA say for the British Academy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning going on in the u._k. in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines there's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly\nThere are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad and the pursuit call me we'll take a very big has\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines once you introduce border checks the place where there are ... for the moment you can have she's running about ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so\nSo there are concerns that I Will be shortages certainly in more distant ... from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate of what would happen in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically be once the initial shock of post you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape up the borders and that without to business costs\nWill make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential fatalities as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as akin to sort of an aircraft crunchy losing hide she wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe and the u._k. leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that\nEurope wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European exposed so they would be a an effect on all manner of European produces whether some and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany um you name it\nThe biggest single ... to ... foot we'll we'll the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shocked waltz it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the case\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline those the idea of going crushing out without a deal now seeing almost inevitable or is this sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it [noise]\nI think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all parts of the war yet so I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels is she going to have to ...\nTo a very divided policy bucking London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so anything could happen ... still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a pleasure [noise]\n[noise] Mm\nThis is all things considered on an H. P. R. I'm Peter below all this week we're speaking with candidates for governor and today we are hearing from libertarian Gillette uh Jarvis\nThis morning on an HBO It's MORNING edition she spoke with an H ... about health care policy and she's with me now to speak about economic policy Georgia Jarvis welcome to all things considered thank you for having me\nSo let's start with business taxes uh some say that because the state lowered business taxes that's contributed positively to New Hampshire's economy or what do you think should business taxes be further lowered to this day where they are or should they go up a little bit what do you think well\nI liked the fact that we've lowered them and that they're going to continue to lower uh throughout the next several years are due to the bill that was passed and two dozen Seventeen I Would also like to see a new program that I proposed for the small businesses and New Hampshire for a new entrepreneurs who are starting a business\nAnd we have what I'm calling a five year tax ramp up period where in your first year as a new business new entrepreneur you are paying no taxes or on your business profits\nAnd then the second year you'd pay one quarter because we pay quarterly for business profit and continue in that vein until you're at your fifth year we'd pay your full tax liability the state would not be losing money on this because these businesses did not exist previous\nAnd it would give these small businesses a chance to actually become successful and to grow into their business to give them a chance to start looking for customers to to build that days\nOr the governor has said recently that the state quote has more money but it knows what to do with he cited a a hundred and fifty million dollar surplus is there anything that you would spend that money on as governor to give you a boost\nI Would like to spend some of it on bringing down our unfunded liability for our state employee a retirement plan we currently have a five point one million dollar deficit in that area and so whenever whenever our government tells us that we have a surplus at\nThat bothers me because not truly we we have a deficit and the billions in our retirement plans that we have made a contract we've made a promise that we're going to pay these people this amount of money and then we can't hold to the promise because the contracts that we made her back\nAnd do you believe that will have a broader economic effect I mean\nThink it will because when you have people and they're all getting to the point\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members on from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think there is a Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more darkness Hitchcock\nIs here what would you do as governor to increase the availability of higher\nPaying jobs and the well one of the ways that we can do that is another tax incentive for high tech jobs because those are the ones that pay more and a tax break for film industry jobs\nWhen Georgia did that they brought in billions of dollars a year\nFor people who wanted to come in and use their old villages to make movies we have amazing scenery here so it's a film crew wants to come in and make a movie using the film a background of New Hampshire\nThat's something we should support another industry that we could use in New Hampshire is by legalizing hemp which is an environmental a godsend that we are currently keeping away\nWhere do you spend on the minimum wage to New Hampshire having minimum wage above the federal minimum new I don't agree with\nMinimum wages we've seen companies increased their minimum wage voluntarily because of the demand for an increase in minimum wage and I think that's really the way to go because then they increased their minimum wage\nWhen they're able to sustain those employees instead of forcing employers who can't sustain that I Would rather see that\nPeople who um are earning the minimum amount that an employer will be able to give\nKeep their jobs than have a few people laid off so that other people can have a higher minimum wage\n... of the lack of availability of affordable housing is still making it hard for young people to uh buy homes and get established here or what role can stay play and making housing more affordable\nThis steak and play the role of fixing education funding because it's the taxes in an area that scare people into not allowing more lower income housing in their towns\nIf we were able to lower our property taxes by fixing our education funding then more people might be willing to allow the zoning changes to allow multi family homes in their communities uh that would help our\nNew homeowners are our new renters and our elderly who are on fixed incomes now\nLibertarian Gillette uh Jarvis thank you very much for

I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible for the lead in the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our ground be found in the midst of all in the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border agents have wide discretion\nCase by case basis I reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied them entry based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have\nEver used marijuana and that could be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state\nBut they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable you know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation and less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws\nEither outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admits that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state the rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened\nNPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nMexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing\nBlocks from the beach the garage door say come as somebody is trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I save everything was going to be OK Irwin last\nDoors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the\nSame can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite few gate is the former head of FEMA and a longtime urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach in other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families any of them were just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on the probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a village down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that spent the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed the wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back it is going to force a much higher global warming or the coast well inland based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now the process of revising the state code and as a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be done it has proven it the researchers there it is way the community is willing to adopt it or not\nRealtors home builders the insurance industry and many others will have a voice as Florida considers how to prepare the panhandle for the next storm like hurricane Michael ...

question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools yesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race\n... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me well why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion and diversity and I'd love to see ... policies change not to have racing it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that\nRace is sort of something that is becoming not just nearly factor but often change the fact that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard as saying that they don't do that but let's say ... missions has been showing in the past few days and has brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that kind of stand if someone's action\nStudents out there as missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of get this a Jewish applicants as well and sort of ...\nAlthough they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think of that argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo\nI think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it\nWe shouldn't just be looking at met in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because\nWhen we focus on something like race I think it creates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard\nAnd you are listening to all things
