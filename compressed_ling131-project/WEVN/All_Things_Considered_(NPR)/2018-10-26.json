Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here see most ... yeah I'm sure it is\nWhat is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway underway here and\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here yeah very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\nMakes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people and all these great and then General Motors just bam you know shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies that eighty so you're good\nToday Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scrubs\nA little bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field group\nAnd was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was\nUsed to being independent used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle it\nSo when you think about the work family that you had at willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Peyton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift\nAt willow run when he was a team do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all that you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nStars are running [laughter] [noise] you got the

corroded old pipes that leads to lead into faucets and showers\nKids were poisoned with lead the state provided free bottled water for two years until April and now after switching back to the original water supply the state once again says the tap water is safe to drink companies and charities donated these pallets of bottled water miss case says there isn't enough for everybody lines up to get\nSomething I'm really discouraged because this is only going for years and years and years have people that class\nAnd it it's just that setting\nDo you still live in ... do you use the water\nI feel that if I Do um I use the wider not to drink but to bang\nSo when you're cooking when you're brushing your teeth are still open and bottles of water and I've been doing it for years yeah\nDoes it just feel routine now or does it still feel like I Can't believe I'm doing this ball and when the government says look we've done the test there's a safe levels of lead it's okay\nYou just don't believe it I Do not believe\nThat trust is going to stress is everybody\nFlint's mayor supports her view arguing that the water won't be safe until all of Flint's corroded lead pipes have been replaced and the medical community signs off on it until that happens people are still lining up to get water wherever they can\nI guess it's something you have to live with but now you know come

Michigan is one of the poorest cities in the country more than forty percent of people here live below the poverty line it's also more than fifty percent black\nAt this church pastor rankled Austin says the poison the water was just the latest set back\nThe water crisis was one more thing on top of a whole lot that this communities had to deal with the disinvestment jobs going away and so this was like almost the straw that broke the camel's back you know in a lot of ways but we're resilient you know the people here are strong and we keep keep moving forward [noise]\nSome of the workers digging up the media and here are wearing a bright yellow vest that say city of Flint fast to start with an image of a wrench and Fawcett they've been at this for years and they are nowhere near or close to replacing all of the pipes that need to be dug out\nRight now I think we either Seventy five percent complete on a larger service line of replacements\nJeff grader is project manager for WTC Stevens construction one of the companies the city has contracted to dig up the pipes but when he says they're Seventy five percent done he's only talking about the service lines between the house and the street he's not including piped in people's houses or the water mains under the road\nThere's still a part of this\nAnd in terms of when you can totally close the book and same mission

years\nHave talked about Flint on the campaign trail everybody we talked to in the city rolled their eyes at that\nThere is a great soundbite let's see what happens after November six\nThis is Jeanette McDonalds I first met her almost three years ago when I was making national headlines for the water crisis we've been checking in with her regularly as she and her husband raised two boys in the city\nToday they use bottled water that they buy to cook and brush their teeth they use filters on the shower debate when I went to their house this week it was the first time I'd heard Jeanette express a little bit of hope her older son justice had a skin condition the last time we were here\nHis ... his flare ups are not as frequent and when they do come they're not as bad as they used to be\nI remember when we were here the first time you said you were known for your long hair yeah and it started coming out when you have in the water yes and it's growing longer now he has it has it's almost my shoulders now\nJustice was six when we first met him now at age nine he's smart and curious he listens carefully to our interview with his mother and then jumps in\nI've a question what's your question why does the ... and the others they they don't\nWell it wasn't that our pipes broke ... what happened was uh\nShe goes into along fact based explanation about the state government's decision to change water sources in an effort to save money and later when we were alone she says that question from her son really through or\nTo the first time asking me that ever and that kinda now with a lot\nIs it hard to know what to say it is it is and especially try no um ... my emotions because I don't you know I just want to break down in front of them because they not understand why she so upset\nWhat's the answer that you would have given to that question is it had not been asked by one of your children\n\nAre probably honestly I feel like it was done on purpose because ... is predominantly black and who cares I feel like is is is pretty much where the nation is right now in the\n[noise] [noise] you see\nYoung black boys getting murder by white police officers all across the nation so what do I think as a black mother raising a black boys how do I think a government that's predominantly white how do they they show me what they feel about me in us here in ... they showed us\nEverywhere I Want to say racism is not alive it is alive and it's so sad and I you know it's hard\nNot to\nTeach your kids about it without sounding races you know what I mean I don't want my children the hate anyone because of the color of their skin I I just I Want to be careful when I'm answering things for him because I Want him to be an adult that's able to change the world\nOn one level this story in Flint is about water but on another level it's about trust in government feeling like your voice matters and that elected leaders care about you [noise] pipes are hard to fix those other things or even harder [noise]\nWhat we find is a real chicken and egg situation when we're trying to figure out how to best approach Latino voters and get them to turn out are they not showing

service the actual internment of mad shepherds ashes in the cathedral crypt was done privately with only as family and close friends president\nTom Gjelten NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nAnd this is all things considered from an HP our mind them leak work this week we're talking the candidates for Congress in New Hampshire in our final interview for this series we're hearing from the Democratic candidate in the first congressional district Chris Pappas\nThis morning on any PR It's MORNING edition path is stuck with Rick gambling about trade and Foreign Relations\nAnd earlier this afternoon he spoke with Peter below about health care policy just spoken to all things considered Hi Peter it's nice to join you\nThe cost of health insurance is rising or the cost of deductibles\nHas been going on for about a decade or what would you do in Congress to try to keep health care costs down this has to be a primary focus everywhere I go I hear about high out of pocket cost\nCan use to escalate we've got to make sure that people have access to affordable health care I think we don't get there by playing politics with the CIA or participating in the sabotage effort that this administration has undertaken we've got to stop that and look for ways to work in a bipartisan fashion to bring down costs there's legislation that's been written\nIn a bipartisan way to stabilize the marketplace or restore the cost sharing reduction that the administration canceled um have a reinsurance pool available\nFor New Hampshire um that would help stabilize costs over time\nI think we benefit from people being in the system that's why I supported Medicaid expansion at the state level and help implement it\nAnd I think that's where the focus has got to be investing I'm In community health centers and in ways where we can bend the cost curve over time by ensuring that we achieve wellness and ensure people are seeing a primary care physician\nYour opponent is in favor of allowing health insurance plans to be sold across state lines is that something you support\nWe've got to be very careful that we don't allow insurance companies to prey on consumers and assuming they don't brand consumers would that be something you support well consumer protections are critically important I trust our insurance commissioner here in New Hampshire to be able to assess that um so I think we've got to look for ways to ensure that there is choice and competition here in New Hampshire\nBut um some of the junk plans that this administration has proposed aren't gonna work for people when they needed and that's why patient protections in the law really critical\nDo you think of the mandate in the Affordable CARE Act should be reinstated\nI I think it is important that everyone is covered and we should look for ways to do that that's why as a business owner we've provided coverage for workers we did it long before the AC came along because\nIt's good for people's health outcomes it's good for the productivity of our workforce sure but it's the mandate the way to do that is the mandate a good thing should come back well that was a key provision of the Affordable CARE Act and I think that was an important step um to ensuring that every one is in the system which helps lower costs across the board\nOr with respect to VA healthcare the trend now is to uh give veterans more options to go away from the physical VA hospitals and get care in the private community is that the right direction the Vietnam for the VA in your view\nThere's no more important promise that we can make then to care for veterans who stood up for us\nThere are a forms that we have to see with a New Hampshire to ensure that we can deliver on that promise for veterans and ensure that they can receive the care that they deserve as opposed to getting on a shuttle bus and travelling a long distance to Vermont or to Massachusetts to get that care\nUm the report showed that there are deficiencies at the Manchester VA their additional services that can and should be provided there and there's also an opportunity to develop a community based model that's going to allow veterans to receive care within their own communities\nThat's going to require us to work through some of the bureaucratic issues of the choice program to make sure that more providers are participating\nUm but I think this is one avenue that we have to continue to pursue to make sure that uh veterans' health care needs are met ... how do you get your health coverage I get it through my place of employment my local uh my my business and it's the same plan that we offer to the workers at our business and how does the way you\nGet your health care coverage for to shape the way you think about it in the way other people get it\nWell you know I've been involved in benefits administration at our business and people need advocates uh because the insurance system is complicated\nAnd people need to ensure that ah you know they're getting the care that they need that they can push back against an insurance company when they're denied coverage for something that's essential\nAnd that's part of the frustration that we have and it's really important\nThat we have patient protections on the books do you speak from experience here have you struggled with insurance companies for your own personal health care um I haven't with respect my own health care but you know the workers at my business or\nOf the tough situations that they've put been put in um buy insurance companies and I think it's really critical that we look for ways to rein in the drug companies and the insurance companies that really um at the end of the day or are in it for profit and that's why it's important that we keep the Affordable CARE Act on the books\n... Democrats in New Hampshire is first congressional district thank you very much for speaking with me great to be with you thanks\nThat's an age Paris Peter below speaking with Chris Pappas you can hear all of our interviews with New Hampshire as congressional and gubernatorial candidates at our website and H.
