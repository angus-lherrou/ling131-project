and sometimes in preparation for road projects that one reason or another never actually get built and that puts the agency in a strange position\nPolice made headlines last spring when they finally nabbed a suspect first series of brutal rapes and murders in California from the Nineteen seventies and eighties\nHas the same killer finally the cash or California investigators ... jet match dot com to name just change the Angelo as a setback\nGenealogy west side to try to identify and the ... state killer\nAnd that was just the beginning police around the country of started doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wandered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six two percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in the debate as a because that illuminate hundreds of ... so it's enough to live with your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in the debate as to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS than you do multiples cause I like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do that the war but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify who supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on the national institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... these supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThe picnic doesn't only can get you criminals or you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to it\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police covering the using the technique to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay review the week to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that leftover DNA behind a wheel K really if foreign governments are going to exploited the technique to identify us to do this for their own purposes so there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defend the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nBanana labs which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these changes that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect you know murders or children things like that it just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd create tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings figure getting cut inspire people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't misused Rob Stein NPR News

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today\nOne topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do\nIt different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's\nHad a rough few years in twenty sixteen murders jump to the highest rates in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has followed some but gun crime remains stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nDirector the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of ...\nThe terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on to straighten it out fest is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk Trump says\nThe widespread stopping and frisky potential criminals reduce crime that conclusions contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes that sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime words and\nThat this new consent decree is more of the same But Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in\nReally hadn't had any keep from them and count now\nMadigan the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting hot and therefore chose to do nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as necessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word is just his money and moved to stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt calls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more policing\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing\nIn Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like ... and little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers\nMartin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew in our lives those were the words from it in for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian the way you rocket carrying two astronaut to the international space station failed during and today\nAt liftoff had proceeded to leave for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n[noise] um [noise]\nAnd they come in and it's like five or my family out of the [noise] the crew\nWas seen in our face after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board that these things and and now they're returned home might be delayed\nFor more on all of that we are joined my Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station in twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nSo this was going to the American ... takes the first time into these ... seconds for like ... ... what kind of training would they had had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as cosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut\nWas a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched they've been working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nThe way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to how Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely back to her\nWhen would be the next ... you could go on a mission like that again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards\nThey're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to isn't based today you know kind of\nLike gosh all that preparation that even that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again by and I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what skill sets should we need one is that going to be\nAll of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information\nPeople be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem manufacturing problem who knows that and once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship\nSpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they dock and come home\nThan they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but but it it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield when the first Canadian commander of the international space station thank you very much for joining us today\nNice to talk of the aisle so thank you [noise]\nIs NPR News ... he didn't he didn't come back we'll say so liberal piecing it together but the fundamental question

killed one of their critics\nCan you imagine that this actually happened in a way that Turkish officials say it did\nYes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference ... almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from

on Trump to stop supporting the Saudi military campaign in Yemen\nThat bombing campaign in our participation in a is predicated on our belief that the Saudis are telling the truth but they are not intentionally trying to kill civilians given the fact that it is likely they are not telling the truth about what happened to Jamal ... why would we believe them that they are not intentionally hitting civilians inside\nJordan the former ambassador to the private sector should also speak out and boycott an upcoming investment conference in Saudi Arabia\nAnd what really there is a universal

NPR News the state department\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nScientists think they have answered a critical question about how our eyes develop the ability to see colors\nIn the process that usually takes place in the womb and out of sight but as NPR's Jon Hamilton reports researchers got around that optical by growing human retinas unit\nGrowing a human retina requires a lot of patients it takes between seven months than a year\nYou're Eldridge should know she's a graduate student mental lab at Johns Hopkins university and for the past few years it's been her job to keep dishes of immature retinal cells alive for the first\nWeek of their life I take care of them every day and then after about Fifteen days I\nThen every other day so they're a little bit more independent\nElders boss Bob Johnston says these clusters of cells develop into a three D. structure known as a retinal Oregon annoyed it\nReally looks an acts like a developing right now that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light colored Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an elder written saw a chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe discuss this crazy idea of could we use these human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colors and things cells in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision and a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't read they don't have these red detecting cells\nAnd so we really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first income cells that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that high right hormone was involved in the development of these ... ... so called cone so he had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added thyroid harm onto that dish during their development and we got more red green con developing and organize and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that side right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are colorblind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that is the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision the condition has been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular so Johnston hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular organized\nSteven backer of the national eye Institute says studies like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye these\nStudies show that the similarity is quite high\nAnd Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's important that we understand how nature control the development of the retina so that we can understand better why things go wrong and disease\nAnd how to develop better treatments the new research appears in the journal science Jon Hamilton NPR
