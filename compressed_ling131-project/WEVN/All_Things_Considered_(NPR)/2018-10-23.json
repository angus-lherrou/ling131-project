P. R. dot org\nIt's for twenty nine Mrs all things considered on New Hampshire public radio I'm Peter below Republican CD two candidates Steve Negron says talking to health care workers on the frontlines of the opioid crisis is key to tackling the problem\nSo that's what I think you need to do is the first thing is you need to go out and talk to the people that actually providing the services to try to help these folks that are struggling with this edition and then take that forward to Washington to see what it is that we can do to help the state of New Hampshire\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first said that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said to us was I cannot bring jobs back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents do you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have said all along that if a parent has a very serious\nConviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law they would not be reunited into those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing or people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegation\nGang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about [noise] four year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has a new idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining\nThanks for having me [noise] support\nFor an H.

P. R. I'm Peter be yellow and all this week we're speaking with candidates for Congress and today we're hearing from the Republican candidate in the second congressional district Steve Negron\nThis morning on an HP our MORNING EDITION he spoke with Rick gambling about trade and Foreign Relations and he's with me now to speak about health care policy Steve Negron welcome to all things considered thank you for having me so if you are elected to Congress how would you tackle the state's opioid crisis\nI think what we have to do is a a better job of understanding what's happening on the front lines and then in role that up and figure out what it is that we need in conjunction with the state and how the federal government can help them and you know I have talked to a governor Sununu about this you know we just got in forty three million dollars I think ...\nAh for this have misspoke model that's going to be coming out there and so you know those are the things that we have to to talk to them about what's working what's not working\nAnd so that's what I think you need to do is the first thing is you need to bring and go out and talk to the people that actually providing the services to try to help these folks that are struggling with this addiction and then take that forward to Washington and see what it is that we can do to help the state of New Hampshire\nBut the New Hampshire house of representatives passed the expanded Medicaid bill back in may or with some Republican lawmakers supporting the bill\nYou voted against it and you said on HBO last week that you did vote against it because you're not a tax and spend the kind of guy Yes sir but is there a role for the government in in helping people living in poverty to get health care\nAbsolutely and I think what what we need to do is we need to be\nSensitive to the fact that people do need help it you know I think it's it was it was um the way the bill was set up with the Medicaid expansion it really was to be able to tax some folks to be able to provide that\nI Believe what has to happen is I Believe the federal government needs to fight for money to get to the state\nAnd then let the states understand what it is they needed to do the bill and I'd have to re read it again as I remember when we did um discussion on the house floor\nI looked at that is yes there's an opportunity I think it was a five year expansion I think is that what it was is that you know where is there a way that we actually let the states that provide and not actually look at it as as a tax on the other people I think there's a common ground\nThat bill didn't provide that common ground and that was the reason why why I didn't vote for it but actually people that are in need those away those programs are in place and that's what we need to do to provide to help for them\nCARE Act last year would you support efforts to repeal Obamacare\nI Would look at the uh the first of all I I don't think the government should be in the business of health care\nUm but the way it is you know you just can't take the rug out from people without having something in its place and\nI think there's some things that you have to look at I'm a huge believer of a of a free market\nI Believe we have to reduce the barriers of event treat other people to come into the state you know we're limited to the amount of providers that are here in the state you know we do um compared her shopping all the time we do it for milk and eggs and for bread we should allow the people in New Hampshire that opportunity to go and find\nThe best um health care for them but we can't do that right now\nThat's one half of the problem Peter the other half is\nWe have to allow um individuals when they go in to get health care as a consumer we need to make sure that we empower them\nAnd that they know what they're getting on when they spend their money right now when you get an explanation of benefits and I see a procedure lists for sending sample and MRI that three thousand dollars I have no transparency into what that that that cost is\nAnd so I Need to be able to give to the to the individual the consumer the ability to shop where they feel is right for them\nSo when you say the government should not be in the business of health care are you saying that Obamacare deserves to be repealed that the government has waited too far into the realm of health care and it needs to back off Yes sir I Do okay and square that statement with what you said earlier about um the federal government being sort of a way to assist states in helping\nThe poor citizens get some kind of health care coverage through Medicaid\nSure we'll medicate certainly is a federal funding that goes to the states um I think you know a Medicaid is a little different animal than on the Affordable CARE Act where Medicaid is a program that gives of money from the federal government to the states\nFor the health care program a government health care program well\nGovernment health care program is you know when you talk about Affordable Care act on reducing embarrassed with that competition comes in not dictated by the government I'm In a competition comes in and then that free market then takes over the free market and Medicare thicker are two separate things I Want to give the consumer the ability to pick what um\nHow could they that they can afford and what they need\nA a personal question for you us or how do you get your coverage and and does the way you get coverage shape your thoughts about what works for the rest of the country will\nYou know I've had coverage in many different ways I had it as a dependent when my father was in the service I had it on when there wasn't even try care as a active duty military I've had it as a industry person when I actually went on about civilian coverage\nI was independent from my wife when she was civil service and we had Blue Cross Blue Shield and right now my family is on track here so I've seen a lot of things\nThat's out there what I tell you Peter is it you need to have as many options out there and let you decide what's best view because what's what's good for one family man up certainly be good for another but I've had medical care in many different facets\nAnd the good thing for me and the and that was been fortunate is it I got to choose which way I wanted to go and I think we need to be able to do that for most Americans\nCandidate for New Hampshire second congressional district Steve Negron thank you very much for speaking with me Peter thank you very much for

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish\nStrict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year in Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\nManner pres considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nCountry has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in ...\nEfforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of ideas in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls the problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act and be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls [noise]\nUm even calling is voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest\nLaws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet\nI I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we are talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much\nUm but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place [noise]\nYou know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things considered\nThank you [noise] there are few subjects that can divide families more quickly than politics can mother against father\nWell you get the idea and then there's this today well relatives of Adam ... published an op ed against him saying the Republican

strategist in Wisconsin He says the ad reflects a political attitude in the state and across the country that's become more nasty and polarizing\nWe have heard about it it's been said arbitrarily go that what's happening with jobs were divisive politics as literally as a family member it gets better with them but I went wow you're that is really just ugly added public where\nPeggy says this kind of ad is bad for candidates and voters because it makes elections less about issues and more about candidates personal lives and Randy Bryce isn't alone in facing this sort of attack in Arizona

Jones goes and goes or Jennifer gold star pogo SARS my brother my brother and I endorsed Dr ...
