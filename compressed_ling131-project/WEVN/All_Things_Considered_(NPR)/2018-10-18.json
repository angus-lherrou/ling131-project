I I don't understand your statement right there I just said everyone gets equal opportunity across the board you don't pick the winners and losers right when we focus on safe school infrastructure or roads and bridges or clean drinking water where there was a need that's exactly where the investment goes right\nSo by doing that you're allowing everyone to participate equally\nLet's talk about the way fair decision you promised to give every other state taxing jurisdiction in authority the fight of their life if they try to make New Hampshire businesses collect sales taxes on behalf of other states lawmakers convenient request that came up with no legislative solution so where where's the fight now\nWell so we ... we created a legislative solution to house just decided not to pass it\nIn the meantime we haven't slowed down where we work directly directly with the attorney general's office again we're we're setting up essentially barriers right barriers to to have other tax a I'm Sorry other tax jurisdictions where they'd be cities or towns across the country\nCome in and ask our businesses to be their tax collector that's not fair that's not the New Hampshire advantage and we're going to put up keep putting up every barrier we can uh the next big step to do is to the legislature to come back uh I think they should take up the piece of legislation that we start it but if they want to craft their own two that's fine as well but they got to move forward and they got to get it done\nOr when it comes to keeping costs slow for rape pairs what progress can you point to\nSo we've done a couple of things is the first thing you have to do you have to do to keep rates low for electric rate payers is not raised them which is why bill three sixty five and in the in\nThe um the net metering bill were just bad ideas for the state of New Hampshire nine oh three sixty five they they over overturned by Vito um unfortunately the majority of electric bill electricity driven legislation\nIs driven on politics not impractical policy\nSo first you start by not raising the rates and then you can do things like creating transparency so for the first time in\nIn a ever I think we can actually have trans parents you know electric bills you can see where your money is going you can see what you're actually paying for we need to invest in renewable energy but we need to do it smart we need to not just look at the environmental aspects\nOf but we have to look at the social and economic aspects of well and make sure when you put all those variables together you're making the investments where you can really get a return or in value of for the rate payer not just for a community or a city but the rate payers actually have to see a reduction in those rates overtime\nToo often we invest in these large solar rays and the city might benefit they might save a few bucks but it doesn't trickle all the way down to the right there and we need to start making sure that that that happens Governor Christie new\nThank you very much for speaking with me thank you\nThat's Republican Governor Christie knew an H ... spoke with him about health care policy you can find that conversation at an H.

Sears is bankrupt has prompted much ringing of hands over the bleak future of the American mall but well some malls are emptying out others are bustling according to the international council of shopping centers\nOver the last five years more malls have opened and closed ... as a former CEO of Sears Canada he now teaches at Columbia Business school\nHe told me some malls will actually benefit from all those Sears stores shutting down\nThere are AAA or super regionals as they referred to who are booming who are receiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with glee\nBecause if Sears is still\nEither happy to take the space back\nThese are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully tenant did and there were only a limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor star but they've got others American what would they do it to share space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort of okay and then there are\nB and C malls and these are smaller these tend to be older in many cases they've already lost his ears and the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing as the top tier miles by can't they re imagine the space and out of food court or something\nThey can do it on paper

declined\nUh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close\nAnd the whole idea that an over large box will act as the draw for a mall\nIs probably outmoded as well and many of the triple a malls or so to speak the anchor tenant as someone like the apple store\nMy which doesn't occupy a traditional acres space but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center [noise] do you go shopping malls regularly no fly\nWhen I was a gainfully employed in the business I did that two and

S. A. official explained the financial angle to a house hearing in twenty Thirteen\nWe believe the Pennsylvania avenues site has consider her potential for higher and better use them as a headquarters of the federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump before he was president showed an interest in developing the old FBI side but by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon at the current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail theories in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWere very very complex super luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people it's almost finish it\nAnd last winter Trump stopped the FBI's move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and gee I say the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of workers elsewhere\nThis spring GST administrator Emily Murphy told a house committee Trump had nothing to do with the decision to rebuild the the destruction that we got came from the FBI and the FBI that direct and she has asked what's requirements that big but the emails released today suggest something else\nOne G essay official referred to the project as quote a demolition new construction Persia presidents instructions\nAnother refer to it as quote what ... is directed everyone to do jury ... a democratic congressman from just across the Potomac in Virginia he said that redevelopment could land a competitor across the street from Trump's hotel\nA number of us thought the president had to have something to do with this personally\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the New York times that quote the president wanted to save the government money and also the FBI leadership did not want to move its headquarters Kathleen Parker is a law professor at Washington University of St Louis her specialty is governmental ethics\nThis is a problem because Trump's intervention may well have getting motivated by his personal financial concerns that his own hotel\nBut he points out the president is exempt from federal ethics laws including the ban on conflict of interest\nA G is a spokeswoman said

next month Cummings is in line to become chairman\nIn a phone call this afternoon coming said he'll wait for official responses from the White House and gee I say he said the White House often stone walls instead it's quite possible the oversight committee won't take up\nThe issue again till January [noise] Peter Overby NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nHistorically white Americans have distanced themselves from many non white ancestry they might have\nNow many are claiming some because they're proud on some because they're trying to tap into benefits designed for minorities so what exactly make someone a minority as Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team tells us it's complicated\nPresident Trump has been mocking Massachusetts

her DNA sequence which we built a Native American ancestry one says she took the test to prove their families tale of having native ancestors had some basis in truth\nBut not everybody tests for personal validation\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy was in the news recently because the Los Angeles times investigation revealed that since two thousand his brother in law William wages was awarded more than seven million dollars in New big government and other federal contracts\nThat were designed to go to disadvantage minorities he declined to test but from family lower wages claims to be one age Cherokee\nUp in Washington insurance broker Ralph Taylor has a suit pending in the Ninth Circuit because the state and item and minority business certification for a program designed to help minorities get transportation industry contracts\nTaylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test the test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is a minority then\nThe question really you're asking is that the DNA test tell him what his identity as or tell any of what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times Nelson said DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves and how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA tests are fine as something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't design them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right out of there are also um profit making entities\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to take seriously the fact that these sorts of programs were meant to start at the counterpoint to discrimination\nBecause the lived experience of minorities can be learned by swapping a cheek for speeding into a cheap Karen Grigsby Bates NPR News [noise]\nDay on Wall street today the Dow Jones industrial average last one
