Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with ... Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteen\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\n[noise] I Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico\nNo question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration and that this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nThis is all things considered on an H.

black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats\nDoug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nYou know we recently visited a vote or meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living our meetings were happening that night across the country how do you go around you ended up leaving the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and\nHealthcare analyst there were sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion with the marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nI think the ... by the women's march [laughter]\nThis is Michelle ... she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nWhite women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty eight teams it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about weather\nCame at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's under scored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters what is\n... he's the family we show what is\n\nWhat why why are\nWe\nIn that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including ... brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I think their chances of being real and that black women ... we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing I ...\nI asked Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nOr religious in the middle of it because I was in the ...\nThe other police officers say something life\nWill he fits the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad is the suit my brother's history\nThere are all star game\nWe use\n...\nEvery man in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of\nIt well black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make\nThings don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with Ayanna Pressley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC on directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and not to back but I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a

let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and allegedly scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either\nRight first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\n... a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who said she was offered money to make false\nDoes not specify the nature of those claims of the special ... special counsel's office as you know it's usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plot\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of events or earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she hadn't been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nFrom the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting gaining here\nThe timing is indeed curious ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this\nCould be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a round the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty six in a a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from other\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this\nThe special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you thank you\nEbola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend to more than

fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the teen arrived\nAt first people were just watching as a team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as the team was about to put the boy into a body bag ... long shot the boy's father rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way that's when the ...\nThing in an instant the team immediately backed

off and time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week [noise]\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now

civilians and kidnapped doesn't children\nAnd so says put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even you know whether they're true motives of the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which he pulled the responders are forced to hunker down and includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone who has had contact with an infected person so the contact can be

don't see the contracts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security and they operate zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to

have workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBut the longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...
