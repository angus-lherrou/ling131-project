a Democrat in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district which has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die\nAnd I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nThis is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices aren't are not at the table and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to us\nOur district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYet the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to algae to Q. people do you think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly\nUm I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I got you know some wonderful fellow than in turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but\nWhen you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group I Do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first president to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before\nAnd I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties folks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nTime I mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beauty cue candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day and the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene I'm so it's not just happening on the ...\nSide too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we use of all the overall national landscape for future algae BP keeps candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what ... discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing\nOne fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing because what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well to those young people that are falling behind us [noise]\nI Want to thank all three of

congresswoman any Custer and Republican challengers Steve New grown meant for a live debate on an HP ours the exchange this morning the two candidates made clear their differences on a number of issues climate change gun control immigration many more\nJoining me now to walk us through their conversation is in each PR reporter Jay moon hey Jason Hey Peter so before we get into what happened on the exchange this morning set the stage for this race for us so this\nRacist for the second congressional district and that's basically the western half of the state and most of the north country\nAnd you have Democrat any Custer she's seeking reelection for a fourth term in Congress and she's being challenged by Republican state rep Stephen aground of national up and I'll just say upfront that most political watchers would say that\nThe second congressional district is a pretty reliably democratic district so in the ground is definitely waging an uphill battle here\nAnd with that in mind how did these to try to distinguish themselves during their debate in the exchange\nWell they both kind of leaned into certain parts of their background in for Steve Negron that meant in part highlighting his Hispanic roots\nNeck runs grandfather immigrated to the U.S from Mexico and even gave a portion of his opening statement in Spanish in that piece of his background was something that he leaned on during one moment in particular where he and congresswoman Custer had a bit of a back and forth on immigration policy\nYou know I find it interesting that somebody wants to sit on the stage and talk to me it was a hundred percent Hispanic about what we go through um try to getting into this country and you know there there were there was a majority and I say the majority of Hispanics that out here that say you know what I don't like other his\nWants to talk about that like we're land of laws um there's a right way to do it we're not doing it and we need to get back to it\nAnd so there you hear a pretty standard GOP position on immigration that you know it's about following the laws on the books and that needs to be the starting point of any discussion\nBut that comes through the lens of neurons personal experience coming from an immigrant family and I think that's the connection that neck runs hoping to make with voters that\nHe is someone who's lived some of these issues and because of that he's got more credibility on those issues than someone who has spent the last six years in Congress\nOkay well let's talk about his opponent incumbent democratic congresswoman Ann mclane Kuster did you get a sense of her strategy going into this debate [noise]\nWell I think congressman Custer did what a lot of incumbents do when they're up for reelection and that is to sound like an income and like you know you're getting stuff done that you're at the center of the action in Congress and that this other person just doesn't really get it\nAnd so she spent a lotta time mentioning specific bills she's worked on and talking about the congressional committees that she sits on 'em but what was interesting to me is that she did that in a way that really stressed what she considers her bipartisan credentials and here's a little bit of what that sounded like\nA very a bipartisan district and I've tried to work in a bipartisan way bringing people together a hundred and five members of Congress to work on it kept force that I created on the opioid epidemic\nUm I've worked across the lines on the Veterans' Affairs committee and on the farm bill in the Agriculture Committee and recently with a brand new taskforce on Republicans and Democrats working together to and sexual violence\nAnd so there you hear her stressing her experience as a legislator\nBut also her ability to work across the aisle which is pretty different from how some other Democrats are running this year with a more no holds barred approach to criticizing the president and Republicans in general and that's interesting to me because as I mentioned earlier this district is thought of as being a pretty safe bet for Democrats\nAnd in a year where Democrats are feeling pretty good about taking back the house of representatives\nOK so a lot of talk from each candidate about themselves what did they have to say about each other whether any heated exchanges are personal attacks during this to me\nYou know not really an overall it was a fairly civil debate which I suppose it's something worth mentioning these days\nUh you know I mean they did get their jobs in but they were mainly about policy and you know those policy differences were made really clear on just about any issue you could imagine I'm you know Negron is a strong supporter of the president's agenda he\nLiked the big tax cuts wants tougher immigration policies opposes gun control as opposed to abortion\nAnd I think climate change is being blown out of proportion\nAnd any customers pretty much the exact opposite on all of those so you know nothing else voters will have two very distinct visions to choose from when they head to the polls this November\nAll right well we'll keep an eye on all of that moving forward for the next few weeks thanks very much Jason thanks Peter and if you want to listen to that debate in its entirety you can find it at our website and H.

I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men that other Iowa prisons where three times more likely to get punished for the ... being disruptive\nNow dom tells her corrections officers to give up fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDom is putting in place a practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different past the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing the rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance\nLast [noise] tell me that if that was like [noise] [noise] [noise] that's ever came on the\nMental health ward Stacey runner is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nHe was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise] it was just meant to be punished once\nShe was sick and stayed in herself through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down of from the dining hall and put a fire pillow so I was asleep when this crime happened [laughter] ... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item yeah that was pretty rough that\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then wonder says she lost good conduct credits those are days taken off are sentenced for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary wonder is serving time\nShe says the change in the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I can say this institution so I'm not so much shame [noise] you know and it helped me with my own my own shame than my own regret\nThis psychiatric unit and the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with bell and the therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nTwo cells there for so here and then friends\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chained for months at a time in the basement sold his property victims is the panic rituals but it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence\nToo but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence so one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search\nWomen can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome to change and discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe warden has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said is you know ordinary people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like oh they do there's wanted you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get in Ninety six cannot cash problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now it closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yell into the night\nThis is what prison cells today across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that [noise]\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack back to white giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in the cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News\nThe Morrow how women running prisons are making a difference in the way they are rough you're

outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear
