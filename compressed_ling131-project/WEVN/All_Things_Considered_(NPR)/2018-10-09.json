that basically\nAll athletes that you were talking to\nYou have to ... it was all athletes okay I'm a I think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform and in the right way but more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of times\nThe state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that can really affect your day to day life\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there\nNow you have been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use this clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask him that fairly basic question that but what does things like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power has to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from the NFL but I Do think you'd want to hear from the players who are everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we're not affected by the laws of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other athlete activists also citing social injustice but doing it in a different way from you I'm thinking is Colin Kaepernick and thinking of Eric read both of whom have made a point not to join the players coalition it are you in contact with them\nOr not in contact with them at this point there was a work [noise] so that they were not\nYeah I'll mention to people following along with we've reached you want to know particularly great phone line in Florida but I think people can hear enough of what you're saying well carry on um when do that let me ask you why why are you pursuing it sounds like similar agendas fighting for social justice but not doing it together\nWell I think you know sometimes there's different ideas of how to go about making sure but I Will say that no matter how you decide to go about it I think all of the work for that they're doing is important to work that we're doing as a coalition is important um and we're all working towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\n[noise] what I Want if you're on the ... the people's hearts change towards these issues there's a lot of people who tried to deny what's really going on in our society and I think our way everybody would be the way you see that\nThere is a specific group of people in our country does not treated fairly and I would be for everybody to see that for everybody to work together and come up with solutions to try to rectify that\nDo you support the rate of current players to take a knee during the anthem\nOf course if I I think for me in the NFL is a peaceful protest outside of the protests if you have to go into the wars\nProtesting during the national anthem only brings attention to the issues but then after you bring the country for the issues you have to go out and address the issues and do the work to try to reconcile\nThat ankle embolden retired wide receiver and cofounder of the players coalition we reached him driving in Florida in ... and thank you\nSupport for an
