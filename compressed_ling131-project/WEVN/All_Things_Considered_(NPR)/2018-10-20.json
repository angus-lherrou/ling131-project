California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he was taser several\nI at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story and she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this\nIt absolutely was I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds I'm it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrests for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to rabbits someone wouldn't you describe those things\nYou might not so for example do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMhm [noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and Kevin between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected issued a mental health in certain areas and connected to issues of race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with the port and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this was an important story and who shouted out every time there's a story that needed to be told\nThat's about ... uh Kobe she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again thank you so much\nPolice conduct towards civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course amplifying ... is that the officer is white and a deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post there had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe\n[noise]\nOh hi\nRoyce West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us my pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that ended up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement don't traffic stops and I guess for land do cats do is kind of tipping iceberg for me\nIt's still end up steel is an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to find the behavior expectations of citizens and police officers and what's lost here is that people thinking the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus\nOn video a video camera sets the stage for additional course content\nFor both the citizen and also pollution police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of courses at a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the ticks to what appear to be two white teenage girls and\nThey're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video is as a primer your we need to go back in the mix mix it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations police officers and citizens and its citizens\nKnow what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in the ...\n... forgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that used to spark your concern here is an African American man and not get an encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you live with that we're\nLiving as this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens\nKnow what their rights are thought put it in schools and make it mandatory was a great place to put it also also driver's license\nMichigan and by doing a great deal repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers or is the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nOthers combination of both out we make certain that there is content that deals with the buyers peace\nSupport for an age PR comes from

L. dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nWe want to turn now to the conservative effort to remake the federal courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society Israel and doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and they all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secrets and signed something of a loyalty oath\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us it's good to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nSo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secrets probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and they're going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts are kind of indoctrination a law clerk is an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties or to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated and people just sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants to\nOf groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline that perhaps the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities sororities they all kind of create pipelines um the Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they'd been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench and heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools\nThe professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not funny\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close most about it a try them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials said a generous donors were make news significant financial investment in each and every attendee\nThey wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges were and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nThey just issued a brief blends statements saying they were reevaluating\nWhich suggests that perhaps they might try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible years that's Adam attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we're going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people\nAbout what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks busting your shows\nAnd let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day cannot stop thinking about it but for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne report this week that you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular nineties show\nAfter its star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which married this week and we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character died by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nNot possible we knew she had a problem she was only a pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just ibuprofen [noise]\nIt's got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opioid opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks much for joining us\nPleasure to be here myself I get also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online Jeff welcome back to you as well always welcome to the back\nAnd we're going to start with you because critics had very different reaction some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough social commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you see it you know it's really interests\nA sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming in a lot of ways in our society ... there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide the inside right and the struggle case one of the things that was really strange to me is that\nOne of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of racist tweet that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that [laughter]\nThat you know medication and essentially led to this behavioral change so there's a tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior medicate or not in the real world says our culture guide though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah\nI Know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and in the presence of the absence of Roseanne was was powerful [laughter] so uh I I thought they did a pretty good job actually addressing it very difficult topic", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "20"}
