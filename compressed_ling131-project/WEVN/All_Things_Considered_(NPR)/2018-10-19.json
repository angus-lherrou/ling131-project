Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to be next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves [noise]\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world they became wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this war to war court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate ... disappearance and perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts maybe led by a former prosecutor\nAnd they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the conflict they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly I think\nAnd we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people [noise]\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work ... she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's at the Saudi consulate are you confident you would get access to the places you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then what happens\nAt the end of such an investigation is it a binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever\nYou find of course they couldn't ignore it I think that would be um something that you might even expect\nUh there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be\nI think is a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to the states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with\nA simply reports in the press and ideas of the Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do those why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this\nThe human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those

governor to in the in the first proclamation to the special session to make it about the entire Supreme Court kind of like smelled that we're going to getting a little bit of trouble with such a broad based resolution\nHe and other Democrats say the most egregious spending and questionable behavior came from la furry not the other four members of the court last week law free was convicted on eleven council federal charges\nYou know what a Republican justice a broke the law and has been found guilty of it and they weren't good with that they weren't just good with that they went further and they

over in the house about\n... the constitutional law professor says he won't speculate on the outcome\nI'm not very good at projecting what will happen in an instant in situation which is highly politically charged and of course we're on the cusp of an auction and uh how that affects decision making is is is rather unpredictable\nWith the situation likely to remain unresolved until after the
