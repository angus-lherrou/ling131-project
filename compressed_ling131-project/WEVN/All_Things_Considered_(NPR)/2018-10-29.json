P. R. and streaming live at an H. P. R. dot org it's for twenty nine and this is all things considered on New Hampshire public radio I'm Peter below voters concerned about climate change aren't seeing very much in the way of inspiring policy ideas from this year's crop of candidates\nI'd love to see just a better local discussion and initiatives that are focused on also stand ability at the local level I mean that's just the focus just trying to get everybody\nI kind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bauer as the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics at the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership or here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative\nOr even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nReally seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nShe doesn't have any ideas what she does and I have not\nAnd says that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people\nAnd calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seemed to be pretty hard and at this point so\nIt will you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thinks Asia thank you\nThe\nNovember thinks is fast approaching and candidates are crossing the state

question and as an HP ours breed the green reports many voters concerned about climate change see little to inspire them in this year's election debate\nLast Halloween was not a great one for Chelsea

people like to be because it is along the river and ... upper level is going to have riverfront someday\nThat's her business partner Carol Clark jumping in they say environmental issues are on their minds with the election coming up\nI Would like to see a more aggressive approach yeah because I think again it's going to have lasting impacts on land owners and business owners and the wildlife\nClimate change and environmental policy has historically broken along party lines with Democrats pushing more aggressive action and Republicans raising skepticism about the real risks that is true in the state's top racists\nBut Lund says she's an independent and hasn't decided how she's going to vote to a certain extent her uncertainty reflects the fact that this campaign season climate change doesn't seem to be a key political issue it's eclipse by others that cost of energy and health care and things like the opioid crisis\nThat's frustrating to voters like Terry ... valley ski town in the white\nI think is them a path should actually come out stronger\nOn the environmental issues I spoke\nWith her while she kind of plant lunch with her family had a small cafe she's

industry here\nI don't understand that at all because where I live we have snow from I read snow yesterday and we have snow all winter long and so sometimes almost into April so\nHe says he's not necessarily a Trump fan but the president's policies seem to be working at least most importantly the economy's doing well so the environment can wait\nIt's an issue I think about but it's not something that consumes me to change that\nFocused on the economy reflects the Republican message this year in New Hampshire both incoming Governor Crist new congressional candidate Eddie Edwards said we need a market driven approach to any changes in energy policy\nMany voters feel the same way and among those who do care most strongly about climate issues are people who are already seeing it impacts their bottom line taking call us and for example who runs the cross country ski center at water filled valley and says they've been very affected by warmer winters in recent\nYears and really um the viability of this industry has kinda gone towards looking at snow making and non snow year activities so like biking in the winter has become a bigger thing especially for us because of our snow is really bad and scary than it gives us something for people to still come up and do and have a good time he liked\nThe issue to be more at the forefront I'd love to see just the better local discussion and initiatives that are focused on on sustainability at the local level I mean that's just the focus just trying to get everybody more engaged\nClimate change shouldn't just be a

colleagues and I've been hearing from a number of people in the past few days that President Trump is our president and that he is the griever and cheese but also that rhetoric has been so give is is that they're not quite sure what they would hear and what they would hope to hear\n[noise] take a step back I Know you've been covering the story pretty much nonstop for the last two days how does the city feel to you right now where are people in Pittsburgh it in the grieving process\nI think that's just the gun and they said he feels like it's being more gentle to itself\nI Would say we're a small city in squirrel hill and the Jewish community form a central part of it\nSo people that we've talked to feel horrified and hearts sick and there's this shared sense of violation that our neighbors were attacked as they prayed and I spoke with a rabbi this morning I Know and he needs a large conservative congregation just about a mile away from where the attack took place on Saturday\nAnd ... them hasn't early learning center and he said parents were crying this morning as they dropped off their children because they're all scared where\nI think all feeling that this ruptured something pretty sacred and but there's been a daily should support ... from across Pittsburgh and the country in the world and it seems that people are taking solace in that\nThis also comes at a time when the entire country as one week away from mid term elections I Know airwaves have been saturated with\nThis is all things considered on an HP are when Peter below\n\nSupport for NPR's

Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general tyrants oceanography who's in charge of northern command\nReno border security as national security and the U.S military will eventually be these capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom ... so that something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty\nUh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional\nFive thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role to get a new law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still we still do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas\nCreating more car bear a barrier is more razor wire fencing crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft in helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so these soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders and the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only in a support role again and the policy come into this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who are doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks even lawyers in public affairs staff\nAnd uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq and right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting

a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nI don't ... remember ever apologizing for anything\nI've said whatever I've said is what I Believe so why would I watch it by\nThat same approach helped him winning twenty sixteen but Democrats like Marie Elena Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent\nImages and truth so he also taught that he's a moderate but when you see is voting record that it's completely not the case and unfortunately most voters do not do that and they just hear him and they say wow you know he sounds good this year his

considered from NPR News\nBy most accounts Federal Reserve policymakers have been very successful in recent years\nThe evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment but the fed success has also undermine one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Phillips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr if you put it in a murder mystery frame\nWas the fed the kill themselves\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds wrong persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo Bullard says the Philips curve isn't working\nBut rumors of its death maybe exaggerated it certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSetting for pale the fellow\nA little more central bank humor this time in apparent reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parrot in a cage\nFell off the phone from within tenuous thrilled with this was\n\nWhen I when I was\nNot that interested in\nThe field it's curved could just be arresting but with the help of his sleeping pill in the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and one\nTo two different ways in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low what is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nUs economies extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that were confirmed your beliefs about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say give me Rowan stable inflation\nEven if it means that Philips curve is dead John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\nShe runs a family business that is a global brand\nYeah my dad had six kids I think
