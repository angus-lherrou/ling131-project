Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent declined here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also still what parts of the markets on his opponent today\nWell a tech was particularly hit hard it's been the foundation of a this market but ah all of the uh all sectors really were down um\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk game since mid summer but the tech sector has been the hardest hit and ... and as I said I just wanted the foundations of the market in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the S. and P. five hundred ... which also has a lot of tech\nLost three and a ... percent so it was a tough day for everyone but particularly for tech\nUm now I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate and the Federal Reserve has said that will continue to raise rates gradually it suggested I Will stop raising two it's ... it's been smart rate between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to do this outrage on government bonds has been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable\nA and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve\nHas said it will continue to raise rates gradually and as soon as you suggested will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go there are some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets the wages will begin to rise more rapidly and create more than ...\nOkay so you're saying the economy\nGood for the stock market what happened well the economy is strong in the U.S and most comedies are saying today sellers is not the end of a double marketing stocks so a while the U.S economy remains strong um Europe is cool to bed and so I've emerging markets\nOr the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are these concerns about a global trade war a disrupting\nThe global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China\nStill what we saw today is this could this be the beginning maybe long downward trend well most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading\nDriven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling given the strength to the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit it's it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down but there are a are points where investors are looking over the horizon nine months\nOr two a year and wondering whether the fed rate hikes will head bring us into recession All right That's

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same day on private planes headed to Cairo and goodbye\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the shouting consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him Fifteen Saudis sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was I don't think\nWe'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people is a lot too\nA a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit this is U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications have left what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect this is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on the show to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person is a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know what you're up to\nBack off ... why do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nI think there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime and Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harmless come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On\nA hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership and Saudi Arabia [noise] when\nYou talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely Jerry ... NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other and a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nKavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they belong hope for the weekend or overturn roe the wait at the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide meanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protest\nReports the Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon\n... CEO of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed and uh but very quickly even after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know the the best cases to move forward to sit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKavanaugh is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn says in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she says many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation that have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this court\nThose efforts will now be supersized again says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal laws\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an ironclad network of states and providers across the country or abortion will still be legal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the mid term elections next month the abortion rights groups ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are wondering [noise]\nNamed Raul is also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight key cities around the country about the impending threats to row for abortion rights opponents like Mallory Quigley of the Susan B. Anthony List the cabin off fight has also served as a reminder of the importance of elections\nThe cabin a confirmation battle kind of exemplified why we're back to the to begin with you know why we've been engaging in Senate races across the country since last summer and that's because you know precisely the Senate is aware Supreme Court justices are confirmed\nWith Kevin on the Supreme Court advocates on both sides say their bases are energized and ready for the next phase of the battle over abortion rights Sarah McCammon NPR News [noise]\n\nIs NPR News [noise] people that are watching him might think oh if he's a baby I'm not going to get caught maybe like even if they bring me to like\nLook who is now our country in court just as he got away with it\nI'm Michael Moore that's today on the team from the New York times daily\nComing up at six thirty here on in age PR\nIt's five twenty nine support for an H.

of a hundred and fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina at some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerge weeks after the storm has passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington you haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told to have to vacate moving on to\nIt without where to go\nTo Gary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can't

shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back\nSchools the sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe closed during a hurricane we actually opened back up that Tuesday for the public after the hurricane um but\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening and they kind of gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked in a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business I came in for a few days\nTo help with the cleanup process but other than that I have no idea about the work environment or what's going to happen with that\nNeither business owner was available for comment this day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck coming\nSmall businesses are especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless the business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced we can't get 'em out\nSo it delays your ability to open up your store or restaurant or or your business\nFEMA famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that hit North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hoped to disapprove that production but it's too soon to tell whether it's with the economy or housing some injury becomes apparent only as time goes by\nTom Gjelten NPR News Wilmington
