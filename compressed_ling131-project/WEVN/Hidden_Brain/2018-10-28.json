Shankar to be done in order the drama of current politics in the United states there is one truth that has endured through the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency he's kept the support of the core group of voters who propelled them into the White House\n[noise] there's only one part in that the finally someone that's not a politician daisy brainwashing [noise]\nThe approval of these voters often white and often working class has meant the Republican Party as a whole has stayed loyal to Trump\nView Republicans running for high office can expect to win\nWithout the Trump base as Trump himself once famously said\nI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay it's like in a crowded [noise]\nThis week on hidden brain we explore two competing perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain this\nIs a group that seals belittled and ignored and you know what some level they're right\nThe other is more critical race as we all know is such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are using it to their advantage\nJune William studies gender class and work in the United states which is currently a professor of law at the University of\nA law she's also the author wrote the book white working class overcoming class clueless miss in America\nAnd Joan welcome to head and bright delighted to be here we've heard a lot about the white working class since the twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars\nThat's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then the top ... their professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income um and I had to find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle it's the middle ... fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nYou have some startling statistics about wages in this middle group over the last half century what's happened to them economically uh starting let's say Nineteen Seventy [noise]\nSince Nineteen Seventy the wages and economic prospects of this group have absolute be tanked I'm actually more recent\n\nJones says blue collar families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her she told me a personal story about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that's of low income families as she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford shop at Macy's so that was part of it I'm also ... she was very angry when the the she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher\nSome of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drug sex rock and roll um didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise]\nJones as working class people have come to a few but government benefits and government programs are not for them\nWhen her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia [noise] Jones suggested to her mother in law actually apply for some help\nHer reaction was striking [noise]\nBeen her reaction was oh I'm not even going to bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they\nDeliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption you know it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the ... end of the political elites to make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book\nIs that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and their outlook and people who are not\nOh so they're going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but they're also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to the community in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who will cost a politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same\nTies are the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there is that it does map on to class but breaks it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did I'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third the people who voted\nWere those people who are left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead toward more focused on individual achievement and self development\n[noise] when you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to their work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the extremes that your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display but it's also a former saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work it's what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups but the hard work is a matter of of of persevering\nAnd staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with us settled family lives um elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what am I I Am\nA lawyer I and a techie\nUm this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite\nMany people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of sort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole lives sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives\n[noise] Mm\n\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many well to do people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out of the book Joan this idea is much more controversial idea among the white working class white\nGoing to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course coached at is what quadrupled I'm In recent years so it's very risky to start to go to college on many of them ultimately dropped out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from\nNon elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges\nAnd social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical schools will record and one from an elite family in one from a ... a white working class family\nThe white working class family has to kid has to actually be about three times as good as the delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jones says researcher sent out to satchel resumes to employers the resume as what identical\nSet off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music or Mr water polo sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage all of\nThis debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway

and candidates are crossing the state speaking with voters I like his message I like his background I think\nMy first time being able to vote just turned Eighteen and mayor so important during his sister Mary with all the candidates are more fish than for\nHowever you are what make sure you're following the news you need to make an informed decision in the weeks that stay tuned to NPR for all our election coverage\nIn each dereliction coverage funded in part by gossip in immigration law and the New Hampshire school administrators\nExactly as states like California Texas we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do use families as you pointed out a calling for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the shores off the friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected we'd walk polls show more as a half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants or a burden to us society and it's like majority things are Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself\nRight those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so just like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise]\nThese threats come in different forms [noise] cultural [laughter]\n\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political threats\nWhy do Republicans on the hill understand the threat to the policy is posed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nThese rapid demographic shift you also have fees increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive\nTo the anxieties of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really taken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message and theme that can really again mobilize their voters and the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have\nA central message such as immigration that can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for there's been some criticism that well this was a short term strategy and if they're gonna\nThey're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou won't you looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino\nWhat do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters [noise] well what\nYou typically see is that as the population of\nLatino voters have increased you start to see the shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh that would be consistent with the theory that immigration\nIs explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen elections so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and our analysis is that\nFrom all these different angles not just of you know I'm cool white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong and important predictor and all of these different\nA political outcomes that we were exploring and so I think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently the political climate we live in
