bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those some churches that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embrace ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to them so how did these two towns which I guess today refers to as liberal bill and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward\nExplanation we use our upbringing and life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine that our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes and the economy\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from radiation energy a local employee

regular basis right before an election someone was sharing article with me about how science\nProves that the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter was say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\nThese claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate\nThere are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn ... is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences\nJohn welcome to hidden brain thank you Shankar pleasure to be with you\nWhen most of us think about how we came to our political views John we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background how does that theory go well\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some I assume are good people\nYeah constantly reinvigorated ... kind of track country in the air conditioning and courage and commitment to the American dream like that here in the first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate here John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think or you know immigration defense or police law and order but I think that's really at the core of of who we are and at the core of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us and it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only makes sense is that they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\n\nYou know there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the act of political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one should liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently\nA positive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe have people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electrical activity or skin conduct tents which is a common way of seeing if somebody is just having a reaction having\nA physiological arousal to that a stimulus and what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content\nBut we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative\nThat is true I never been a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we had the most luck with a pictures of mutilation uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about that with all of a good look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the base about\nLiberals brains when they looked at a mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the ... to ... matter of sensory to part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century to would be active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody stepping on a rusty now goes right through their foot\nYou're some at a sensory too it'd be active and what we saw in these in these brain scans was\nMatter of sensory too conservative doesn't mean the conservatives are hard hearted or just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics\nThe shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n[noise]\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins\nIdentical twins have identical genes fraternal twins have similar but not identical jeans\nIf you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins\nEach twin Paris raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as it grew\nAnd fraternal twins as a group that suggests that biology not environment is a driver I asked John what such studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda Neves\nNot long ago it's fairly dated data set\nA but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views\nAnd when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a find that there the political views were quite heritable ... ... ... ... um although people oftentimes must read this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science many people didn't like that at all uh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four\nPercent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not and zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nAnd so you you basically you're able to tell in some ways that there is a closer link in the political orientation of identical twins than in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say [noise]\nOne of the big implications of all this work up besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have with fresh inside\nA and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we were able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talked to me about that idea Jon\nWhen other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handedness you know we used to think that [noise]\nInto a lazy habits my father was left handed and the teacher you know this long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to interact with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left handed is very biological this was something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people uh realize that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that\nSo we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather were oriented to the world in a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits and biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when\nWe had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was often to the left of the more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a shortage of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years\n[noise] what I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats and think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise]\nI'm Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to your verbatim but it's basically that uh the division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people who are supportive of innovation is very old and a structured the world since time began\nStarting with Hitchcock is here\nTo talk of conflict that's because the conflict wasn't resolved to the Democratic process but through the bloodiest war in American history\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand\nAnd that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president of the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in a science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery\nThey put that head of the democracy so now the conflict just defense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength but they can also be in a credible source of weakness\nAnd the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right but I Want to at least concede the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of that the ... it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future\nI think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think that could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far you're willing to go\nAnd so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family right so a family we you know ... every family be moved by the coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there is love and the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down than actually the conflict ... the family apart [noise]\n\nAnd the twentieth century the bonds of that democracy what tested again when we come back the political up people's or the Nineteen sixties\nAnd there are echoes today [noise]\nYou're listening to hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam\nThis is NPR [noise]\nGood afternoon this is an age PR where support

[noise]\nAnd I think what leaders of the civil rights movement figure it out is that ... actually can be a plus not just a minus so if you can bring it out if you can expose that if you can put it in front of people and show that the principals they hold dear are being violated\nThat in some cases at least forces people to choose sometimes they choose wrong unfortunately but sometimes actually side with principals so this was basically a what Martin Luther king was trying to do he he wanted to pick some of the most challenging places to protest Birmingham, Alabama Selma\nKnowing that there were um some some pretty tough people on the other side some pretty brutal of a police and sheriff's on the other side who are going to take that opportunity to beat up the protesters used dogs water cannons so so what he realized is\nThat if if you could make people in their living\nRooms fetus violence and and bring it out and you know into the light of day then suddenly the ... which unfortunately was that the heart of the country at that point we were talking about equal protection but we weren't living equal protection [noise]\n\nTelevision I don't think you could possibly have done it but with TV [noise] he was able to go um\nAnd the reaction do came and it came as wouldn't leave from the other side and put on display this upon reasoning\nHanding out with no so angry and fries and bring body knows that he said no legislative body can for new and you would know\nWho said what you need once again is this link between conflict tied to this deep faith in the democracy even how imperfect perfect is an understatement\n... grooms knew\nOne hundred years later\nThe life of the negro is a new family moved by the amount of memory day in\nAnd the thing is when you think about some of the other leaders of the time there were certainly people who were advocating some portion of what the south was saying and Eighteen sixty one there were people who are saying look this system is so broken it is so\nFaulty that there is no fixing it we actually have to break it down and I think the point that you're making is truly when me which is that king wrapped himself in the flack you wrap themselves in this ideal of the American democracy and that potentially is what made the cockpit productive\nRight so look you know there were a lot of things he was concerned about but he said let's take these principles and actually try to see if we can all live by them\nMhm mhm mhm I think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect but it is extraordinarily resilient and it is generated\nTremendous progress economic progress social progress political a lot slower than we'd all like by boys things can go very badly and we all know that and so the question is can you continue to make progress [noise]\nSo which of these historical analogies describes the current moment in the United states are we on the brink of a new chapter in democracy\nOr on the brink of divorce\nI asked David about a number of more recent developments that rates troubling signals about the health of our tomorrow\n[laughter] question for the rock Obama's birth certificate very soon I had people looking into it we're using articles in front of the magnitude of costume crisis no reason for\nThey shall we were actually children throwing a temper tantrum because their team lost [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Keene", "day": "21"}
