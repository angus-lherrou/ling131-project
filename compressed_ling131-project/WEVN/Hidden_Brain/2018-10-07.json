I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story that may sound familiar to you a story of poverty and that is the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusions she'll pay attention to your own ride the is now in her late thirties a few years ago her life\nUnraveled at the time she around the dining services department at a senior living facility should be with a company that ran it for more than a decade one day she made a mistake\nAnd how it's just in a rush to get home that was on because [noise] daycare clauses in St Louis I get off at five\nAnd it was like maybe a ten mile drive busy traffic area and I know I had to pick up diapers and easiest thing for me I thought would be to pick 'em up before the baby up\nAround needs stopped at a store run in and grab the diapers she's swipe took credit card at the self checkout station and raised out\nIt turns out she used the wrong card\nHer own by the company credit card\nWas crazy is I didn't realize at that moment and I didn't realize until my supervisor climb in and said hey let's just prior to his son had she not said anything I don't think I Would have realized that\nRun to carry the card and kiss you needed to buy dining supplies or what should never had a problem before never been reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do and her response was well\nAnd I'm like no I didn't know that like can I just pay you back it was only what twelve month [noise] and she said now in cases like that you automatically have to terminate employees\nI just cried and cried like a day because I couldn't believe it\nI didn't want to go home and tell my kids and what happened and I didn't want to tell my husband what an Avon I just didn't know what to do at that point I felt like a ... I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a a good example even though it\nWas a mistake brandy on more than her husband so the loss of the job hit hard she felt like a loser she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like cooking takeoff meals but the stress grew Randy and her husband began fighting\nShe had supported him when he'd be laid off a few years earlier and she'd expected he'd do the same for her but he felt the situation was different he'd been laid off brandy was fired he was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake\nThe final argument was that um I left the house that morning I was going to job interviews that two interviews that day and I didn't purchase toilet paper son when he got home from work that day there was no toilet paper when I\nDo I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or a credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the prices and among bring the prices and figure out if you took charge will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework go the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have the lonely tend to focus on the\nFriends they do not have the result is they try too hard to be locked in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't be attention to what's actually being set the conversation\nFalter instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed what happens as a result people do voice the aqua conversationalist and lonely person becomes even lonely [noise] this lens offers a new way of\nThinking about white people who find themselves in scarcity seem to do things that to an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper Sanders says we're asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty make everyone\nLess capable that it's the it's it's you and I tomorrow what are we to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same effect that poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some bleeding hot theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and on and send though wanted to test that hypothesis\nDoes all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich so how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers\nActually created a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once that the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor and the month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next center now that tested the farmers on that long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched\nOther research that shows for example that fire marshal are well off tend to read that feels more regularly and farmers who are poor fire marshal were poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short I'm thinking to be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want\nThink about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test put simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely\nBut they might be another former scarcity\nYou have experienced on Sundays we get to leave that for pm some days we don't leave till one AM [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning usually work eighty hours a week\nWhen we come back we'll find out how being overworked and exhausted can produce its own form

Caribbean rich\nI mean it's one and then what would it cost ten dominant\nMost of us would never know what that's like [noise]\nBut if you've ever seen at least a little curious about the lives of the liver well see this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager Bruce discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers learn a lot about the private lives of their clients and they're very different set of rules that govern that world\nReal Cancun welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show for wealth managers to do their job\nNeed to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance financial life but everything about their life give me some examples of the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager I Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate and increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nThere can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets preferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSuicide already interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm telling me a little bit about the people you met to be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup about what kind of person becomes a wealth manager\nWill several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter]\nSo you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack them around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to ... or to provide services to their clients uh you're right about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story\nSo this is one of the first stories\nThat I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager\nEleanor told the story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom my clients who lives in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it\nAnd the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter] so imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix the problem like this but Eleanor somehow did it she she determine where the client was\nHad been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are some times ah clients do make request like this not because they're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named\nDavid yes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was\nMeeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed the desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon\nAnd David said no I'm I'm your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today you're the fish monger and so David happen to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had\nThe connections and the will to do what I wanted one I Want it and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they are not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubles marriages and we were children just like you know everybody else\nBut but wealth you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or a parent will ask the wealth manager to break some bad news to the next generation to to his or her own children\nSometimes to the wealth manager has to broker a truce between\nFeuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan and has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family\nThe big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues\nThe lawsuit process and many countries makes public many many private documents that would reveal the extent in nature of the family's wealth all of which has had been carefully guarded secrets", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Keene", "day": "07"}
