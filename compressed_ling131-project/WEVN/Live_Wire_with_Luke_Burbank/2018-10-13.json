in Portsmouth to talk about her latest book leadership in turbulent times\nI Am so glad to be back here\nOn the maiden voyage of my new book\nLeadership and turbulent times over the years I've been lucky enough to be here a number of times talking about one or another of my presidential biographies so I Know what a great book loving audience you are it's just hard to believe that his down five decades that I've lived with presidents who are no longer alive\nWaking up with him in the morning thinking about them when I go to bed at night it may seem in our profession to spend one days and nights with dead presidents but I wouldn't change it for anything in the world [noise]\nMy only fear is it in the afterlife this going to be a panel of all the presidents that I've ever sat it [noise]\nAnd every single one will tell me every single thing I missed about them and the first person to scream at will be Lyndon Johnson\nHow come that damned look on the Kennedys was twice as long as the book you wrote about me\nWell what happened is when I moved from one of my precedence over these years to the next I always felt a little guilty I'd have to move all of his books out of the room from FDR's out bring in Lincoln\nSupport for an HP ours live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustained excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound

man so I chose the foreign leaders I knew best Lincoln teddy Franklin Roosevelt and LBJ on civil rights all of whom led through times of turbulence that's the title I had no idea five years ago it would be so relevant today [noise]\nIndeed I fear it becomes more relevant with every passing day though not a single word is that about the current political situation I Believe the stories of these leaders\nWho set forth a template of shared purpose collaboration compromise and civility underscores the absence of unifying leadership in our country today I fear if we ignore history it will be at our peril\nFor without heartening examples of leadership from the past\nWe fall prey to accepting our current uncivil polarized climate as our norm by heartening examples I don't assume a willful optimism the stories here provide evidence in proof that real norms have guided us through the greatest trials of our history people often ask me [noise] yes [noise]\nOften ask me as if I Know it was an historian are these the worst of times and my answer is a resounding no imagine what it was like when Abraham Lincoln took office the country had split into a civil war that would leave six hundred thousand soldiers dead was about to begin\nThe letters that if he had known what he would face during his first months in office\nHe would not have thought he could have lived through it\nImagine what it was like the theater Roosevelt\nThrust into office after McKinley assassination at a time when there was widespread talk of upcoming revolution between the workers and management the industrial revolution that shaken up the economy as much as the technological revolution and globalization of done today big companies were swallowing up small companies\nThat was subtle [laughter] sorry [laughter] that's if you're not sure [laughter]\nWhat about FDR's using it was it hard for him to find\nPlace well what's so interesting about FDR is that he grew up in a really insulated world even more than Teddy Roosevelt and he wasn't a particularly good student at Groton he was kind of a gentleman see at Harvard and he went to Columbia Law school and then he finally became a clerk in a\nIn a Wall Street law from a conservative off the law firm\nAnd then he's twenty eight years old and somebody comes to him and says how about if we give you a safe safe seat in the duchess county Democratic Party platform and run for that seat and immediately he steps\nAnd and he's and he said I Love to do it and it gets out on the campaign trail and all of a sudden he's barn storming it's exactly what he was meant to do [noise]\nUm he was so at ease with people he was able to listen to them to ask them about their lives\nAnd he treated them with no condescension he loved every minute of it\nIllinois who was there at the time said that he wasn't a great speaker at first that he would have so many gaps between what he was saying that she was afraid he would never go on until finally by the end of the campaign he was going on so long as you have to go and drag 'em off the stage [noise] um so then he found William James the philosopher said there's a moment and characters lives\nWhere they find that voice within that says this is the real me so he found that\nSo we became a politician and became assistant secretary of the navy ran for vice president Nineteen twenty and was pretty interesting guy but without some of the debt that I think the polio experience created in him um he um\nHe he had to spend years just trying to learn to walk again and he said it it taught him humility which he had not had before the sharing of his vulnerability and his limitations\nAnd when he created the Warm Springs rehabilitation center\nBut he was able to do for the other patients was not just in the warm waters of the giant pool helped him to physically get better\nBut he taught them joy in life again and and purpose in life again he would have water polo tad they would have wheelchair dance instead of cocktail hour is that the actor goals that have speeches at night and they began to say as they all said that they could live again a life\nAnd then once the depression came and he becomes president he can identify with people to whom faith has also delves into an find hand and the empathy was such a huge part of his presidential success\nThere so much in there and that we need to come back to you but let's not leave LBJ first in his youth how did he find his voice well\nLBJ loved politics from the time he was like three years old [laughter] I'm his father was in the state legislature and he loves nothing more than sitting in the in the background while he was father and the cronies are talking on the porch\nAnd he loved campaigning with his father on the trail but he first appears on the public scene when he's at a picnic and there they used to have people speak the governor was running for for for office he was supposed to come up and speak on his own me up but he wasn't there\nSo LBJ pops up and said oh speak for him and he stands on a truck and he gives his damn winding wonderful natural speech and all of a sudden people look at them and say hey he's Sam John\nAren't a lot of these stories so he goes to college and he decides that he wants to become the power in the Congress and the college so how he does it is amazing he decides that the the way you get power is to get close to the people who have power\nSo he figures I got to get close to the president of the college so he's on a janitorial crew outside every kid had to work and he decides to clean up more trash in more in less minutes than anybody else so he'll get noticed\nHe does he get put on the inside janitorial crew and then um he he asked to mop floors outside the president's office the next thing you know he's a clerk in the president's office the next thing you know he's running the president's office [noise]\nAnd then he stepped up and gets into politics from there but the most important experience he had there and again this is where empathy has developed he took a year off between college and pretty much it was just climbing power\nBut he went to this place called to Tula a Mexican American school and he saw as you said the pain of prejudice on those kids faces so he used his salary to get them games in sporting equipment to make them feel that they had a chance in life you wanted to fire ambition in them and they all said he was the most remarkable influence on their life\nSo once he had had that experience even though we just climbed power for a long period of time\nI think he really wanted to return to that he had a massive heart attack in Nineteen fifty five and he had just been a power man and then he asked himself\nWhat he's already majority leader the most powerful one in the country said what if I died now would anybody remember that I have lived what would I be remembered for similarly to Lincoln So then he got a civil rights bill through the Senate and then of course when he becomes president that becomes the main thing that he will be remembered for\nYou to spend a lot of time talking about the importance of empathy and you know you got into a little bit of where we could see it now how would you encourage leaders now to to seek it out and to find it within themselves\nI think it's so important for these leaders to get out of Washington and really be able to talk not just to your base of the people that\nLove you but forget around the country and see\nThe way other people live I mean it is the problem you know as as I can see that you understand too that people in different parts of the country now are feeling on pleasant and that and not even wanting to know the people who are living in other parts of the country the rural areas feeling different from the city areas [noise]\nUm my son who went to Harvard College and in old one and then after September eleventh he joined the army and he said that experience was the most extraordinary experience because here he was with a blue moon he earned a bronze star he was in Iraq and Afghanistan and the platoon was made up of kids from all over the country\nAnd they had a common mission I sometimes think that the reason we had more bipartisanship in the fifties sixties seventies even to the eighties was a lot of the congressmen and senators had been in World War two or the Korean War and so they knew what it was like to go across all these lines and care about purpose they cared about the purpose of the institutions\nI that's what worries me so much today is where is the purpose of the U.S Senate right now they should be wanting that even more than their partisanship\nPartisanship on both sides has become so so extreme and so I sometimes think my son is very much in favor of a national service programs the idea that more\nPeople would come out of ... out of high school\nAnd go and help other people in other areas and they'd get to know each other across lines Teddy Roosevelt for example when he was president took a train trip around the country every spring and fall for six weeks each spring and fall the whistles dropped trained would go through all parts of the country he'd get out of the out of the train he talked to the people in the village station then he'd stay in the train\n'em for hours just waving to people who would be standing at the little road crossings along the way there's a funny story when he was waving frantically had a group and he was rather hurt that they didn't respond to his waves until he was told because he was near sighted he was waving at a herd of cows little wanted to\nThey wouldn't away in fact I did not way I'm Lawrence\nWith Doris Kearns Goodwin we'll be back after a short break it's Nineteen you're listening to an HP our\nSunday evenings at the end of the weekend\nThere at the beginning of the week it depends on how you look at it whether it's the beginning or the end

Roosevelt I mean jeez he really Teddy Roosevelt it it seemed like it was agonizing ... not to be in power how did they view their legacy and how do you see modern presidents you know being so conscious of that now and how do you come here it's a really good\nQuestion because I think they're much more conscious of it now because of these presidential historians polls than they were at that time\nUm but FDR as the interesting one he's ... he creates the first presidential library and he saved everything he was a collector when he was a kid anyway maps and stamps so he just saved everything\nBut when he opened the library he said the most important thing that's going to be in the library or not the memos from my officials if the letters from the citizens who wrote to me and they told me what they were thinking and feeling there's one letter I remember reading at one point along the way when he first gave his first inauguration\nAnd somebody presumably wrote a letter saying my roof fell off my dog ran away my wife has mad at me I don't have a job and now everything's going to be a ride because you're there and what he did the most important thing he did was to establish a bond with the citizens and little wonder that he wanted to be remembered for that\nI mean he was able to make them trust in his word from that very first inauguration\nAnd from the very first bank crisis where he goes on his first fireside chat and he tells them all that it's safer to bring your money back because we've now got an emergency banking bill and I promise you it's safer there than in the mattresses is close the banks for an entire week and they were worried that when he opened them they might\nTake their money out again long lines that first Monday when they open it but they are bringing their money back they're carrying it back from their mattresses 'cause they trusted in them\nAnd that is so important in a leader that swear words matter but just to go to your question about that today I think it's true ever since we've had these presidential historians polls and all the presidents hate them\n... and little wonder that they hate them because they feel like they're being judged by these outside guys\nSo but um what happened is a funny story one night I happened to be at a White House dinner where President Clinton was next to me and that day a presidential historians poet come out this was Nineteen Ninety seven before Monica Lewinski but they only ranked him like average\nAnd so he was really mad he was so grouchy the whole night at the dinner and so that very day there'd been an announcement that the owner of the old Brooklyn Dodgers would move them taking them away from us who growing up in New York to Los Angeles was\nGoing to ... percent Hamburg says the red Sox [laughter] absolutely will talk about\nThat but meanwhile they said maybe they'd come back to Brooklyn now that they were being sold so I said to President Clinton I'll make you a corrupt bargain if you bring them back to Brooklyn up put you up a notch on the next to stories\nThat I don't know if that's the power to\nDo that but a funny thing is just happened I I I it seems funny anyway James Buchanan used to be on the lowest\nFor a long time a new poll was taken not recently I mean very recently and I'm President Trump was down there so the story in the paper was that Buchanan family was celebrating [laughter]\n[noise]\nWe've been getting some great questions from you guys and so one of them um which president is Trump most comparable to and I would add to that\nWhich of your four guys would you send in as a new chief of staff\nOh that's a great question um wow well I think it is Teddy Roosevelt that he's most comparable to I mean teddy became a celebrity and his time more than other presidents had been people were just obsessed by his colorful nature is interesting comments\nUm and he and he was able I think to establish a relationship where people felt that it was more people are however felt he was on their side\nThe big difference however is that ... square deal was for both sides for the rich and the poor for the capitalist and the wage worker he wanted both sides to win\nAnd I read it a a column another column but a a small part of the art of the deal where President Trump said that's that's just crap that both side wins you just have to weigh in yourself\nAnd that's a really different than the way you think about it but more importantly I think teddy established college all relationships with the press he loved talking to the press when he had a a barber's our way to shave in the mid middle of the day he let the press come in and they could ask them all sorts of questions and he'd be moving around in the chair I don't know how the barber did it\nAnd um and there's a moment when a journalist criticized him and and this is where modern presidents aren't so good at this not just not just President Trump that was it was teddy as well but at this moment\nA journalist wrote a criticism about his I'm more of the Spanish American war and said that he had post so placed himself in the center of every action that he should have called the book alone and Cuba\nAnd everybody's laughing and the country and he writes about letter back and said I regret to tell you that my wife and my children are absolutely delighted with your review of my book [noise]\nSo I don't want to meet you I've long wanted to meet you but the interesting question who could be the best chief of staff without a question it would be Lyndon Johnson oh my God do you think that he would allow people to be leaking items\nUm do you think he'd allow people to be saying bad things about each other in public I they would have to answer to Lyndon Johnson in the morning and the night so that there would be good to bring that kind of force back just to give some unity and some\nSome ability for us to look at what the what the team is doing there and I mean the leaks are just it's really hard to to govern when that's happening\nAnd I don't know why it's happening or what's happening um and they say things about each other that come out into the press\nUm Lincoln was really upset at one point when he hurt his cabinet members who some of them didn't like each other say things in public and he sent a memo said it would paint me very much to have these things come out we have to stay together where we are and I think that's really true\nSomebody else asked about Congress in any suggestions for leadership styles are skilled you would offer up for them [noise] I think\nWhat they need to do is just to spend somehow more time with each other outside of their partisan tribal this\nUm [noise] you know in the old days they used to stay in Washington on the weekends because they couldn't travel home is easily they didn't need to come home and raise money the poison in the system is the campaign money we have to do something about it [noise]\nThey found so much of their time raising\nMoney from a very minor base now because of the way congressional lines are drawn me have to have nonpartisan can these things can be done\nNonpartisan congressional drawing of lines and they used to play poker together they drink together their wives knew each other so they knew each other as human beings not as the other and somehow we have to figure I was at a dinner a about a month or so ago\nAnd I was speaking at the dinner it was so nice just for that one night to see these people talking to each other and and they there seemed to be no animals and then they go back to their sides the next day so somehow we I mean if it were Lyndon Johnson he'd have them all living at the White House and not able to let\nThe White House leave over more economic part of the game in fact\nWhen he first became president every single Congress men in groups of thirty into the White House not just the leaders he was talking to\nBut every congressman and then Lady Bird would take the the wives on a tour after dinner the mansion and he would have port and brand new with the guys but they all felt they were part of the White House they were part of the of the structure not just the leaders of the Congress there's things to do with just have to get done\nYou talk a little bit briefly about this idea of fame for these four guys and but you also write in the apple under the fame that your guys craved and the recognition they shot bears little resemblance of today's\nCult of celebrity what did you mean by that [noise] well it's interesting\nIt was a book called fame and the founding fathers which talked about how at some point in the founding fathers live they started out with personal ambition but at some point because of what was happening in the country at large because they were together as colleagues their ambitions stretched\nTo something much larger to creating something obviously in this case the constitution the declaration of independence a republic they're creating it's going to last over time\nAnd they felt that sense of fulfillment that comes when you're doing something larger than for yourself\nAnd I think that that's one of the key leadership traits not just for presidents but one in ... for a person becomes not simply for their own self aggrandizement but rather for what's happening to the team what's happening to the community what's happening to the company what's happening to the college whatever you happen to be leading\nAnd that's when you you become the possibility of a good or a great leader and these people I think in the setting maybe you're in the setting of depression or World War two or you're in the setting of the civil war this is one of your questions earlier\nIt does make it easier to mobilize people to a common cause when you have a common crisis\nBut we have to hope we are sort of out of crisis now that that until we make our political system healthier again until we make more young people and it's happening now this is the awakening that I think should give us hope more young people running for office more women record breaking numbers running for office [noise] um\nWe have to just realize that we can't have a democracy without respecting our politicians and when you look at the polls right now eleven percent only approve of Congress only in the thirties approve of the president's see what the Supreme Court\nAnd you can't run a democracy without those institutions being respected so we have to rebuild the respect to those institutions we have to rebuild bipartisanship we have to rebuild both parties feeling more importantly related to their constituents into the country and to their institutions than they are to their party [noise] um\nSo will you anyway [laughter] I've got to be an optimist that's that's my nature well\nSpeaking of women and we've spent a lot of time on the guys but can we please talk about these four fabulous first ladies and what contribution did each of them have to their partner", "show_name": "Live Wire with Luke Burbank", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "13"}
