the Alberta rose theater in Portland or to take a listen to this [noise]\nIf I seem a little\nCalmer a little more at peace a little more centered than normal\nStanding up here it's not an accident and people I recently started meditating [noise]\nAnd it is changing my life technically I have not officially started the meditation [noise]\nBut I downloaded a meditation app to my phone [noise]\nWhich as you know is the hardest part about meditating I Believe the Dalai Lama said that\nThis is the first meditation app I have\nTo my phone I'd like to tell you that but it is not true [noise]\nI have a folder on my phone\nBasically like the enlightenment and graveyard\nIt is full of meditation apps and breathing apps\nAnd various things like that that I have downloaded and never even opened\nBecause I like to hear about it or I I read about it on slate and I'm like this is the one that is going to change my life and then I downloaded and then it doesn't really changed my life even though I have been on this journey pretty much my entire life to try to find\nThe thing whatever it is it's going to actually make me feel some sense of inner peace and happiness like even when I was a kid when I was ten years old this was my little ritual I Would do my chores on a Saturday or get my allowance which was two bucks\n[noise] I Would ride my bike to the Jack in the box near our house and I would get a jumbo jak for Ninety nine cents\nAnd I would get some fries with the rest of the money I'm sidebar that was about Thirty years ago and three decades later he going price for a jumbo jak hovers around Ninety nine cents still [noise]\nWhich seems like a big red flag [noise]\nSo I gave my little food and I'd ride my bike home and I would sit on my bed which is all made in my little room that was all clean from doing my chores and I would get the food set up and take out the first French fry and I didn't catch up now bite into it\nAnd in the moment that I was biting into that French fry I Would feel a total sense of calm [noise]\nThat would last for upwards of Fifteen seconds\nBecause then it was time to start thinking about the next thing whatever that was an even do intellectually even then I understood that this idea of having to have everything perfect even though I knew that was not like\nThe recipe for happiness I sort of have continued to live my life thinking that if I can just to get everything perfect\nWelcome from the murderers theater this week [noise]\nMy name's Luke Burbank I'm your host\nWe are here with George Saunders is the latest book is Lincoln in the bar do this book is about Abraham Lincoln son willy who passes away and he's in\nThe bar do which is a sort of limbo I guess of sorts and a ... you said you had the idea for many years ago but then you started working on in earnest for about four years or so when did you realize you really had something\nYou know there's in the book one of the things I did was I I uh quoted from historical sources verbatim was right plagiarize and all of that was an amazing part of the book yeah\nAnd so there was just an afternoon where I I had tightened up all these historical sources cut them up with scissors was on the floor arranging it kind of feel like I'm just avoiding writing this is this is an elaborate we're doing a collage that's right yeah and then at one point it was described his party that the Lincoln's head and\nIt was kind of this party that sent the sun and to the death spiral 'cause it's very loud party and the White House\nSo um I was renting these bits and suddenly this magical thing happened every writer craves which is it stopped being writing and it started being event\nIt just it just felt wow that party has happened in front of my eyes so it's kind of the realization that even that weird thing that had nothing to do with me typing new tax was part of my uh attempt to emotionally moved to the the audience and then I thought oh this is really weird and actually it's there's a great feeling like you're feeling a little naughty\nOr someone's going to really hate the you know and and that's actually the feeling you want\nBecause if you can convert that person who says passes bunch this fake news you know or whatever is that\nIf you can blow away we're trying to create a safe space for these people\nSick and I got [noise] but if you forty five minute timeout on those terms\nIf you can convert the skeptic then then you're really an intimate communication with your readers\nUm you obviously had to do a ton of research about about Lincoln as well and about the time um did you find out about Abraham Lincoln that you had not previously no\nYeah I just fell in love with them I mean he's the one thing was that he was actually even though he was known as being ugly he was incredibly attractive to women\nWomen all we know really really drawn to him very kind very tall kind of powerful guy and he he loves his wife so much so one of the ways he self gamed was to deflect his attention from young women he had a whole system of kind of\nYou know turning away from them in the name of not aggravating married not making your own happy so I thought that was kinda cool where do you find out something like that has made it up\nYou know yeah I Know the\nGuy I Know that sort of as\nYou are a master of George Saunders\nAlso you know the thing is I I I came to love about him and said here's a guy who's you know a he has no he's in the last four years of his life making incredible progress ... learning new stuff everyday\nKilling tens of thousands of young men with his mistakes you know and if you track those last three years he's somebody who just kept opening up an opening up and I think his I mean this is my interpretation but I think his eagle just really shrunk\nAnd he became so involved in trying to bring benefit for everybody else that I in Buddhism I ...\nLarge ego in in the face of this pain kind of shrunk and a sort of watch them at the end having realizations about race that we're still not quite you know we still haven't really internalize was kind of really moving you know\nWould you say that stands in contrast to the current president [noise]\nWhen you when you go on a wicked Peter under softball question that's going to pop up well I actually\nI I Do want to talk a little bit about that world with you because you wrote a piece back in June of twenty sixteen or at least that was when it was published in the New Yorker a windy presidential campaign was still in full swing and\nI still think it was probably for me maybe one of them are illuminating things about the the sort of rise of Donald Trump you went on the campaign trail and just talk to people at his various rallies um did that\nThen to make you less surprised than the rest of us when he actually won or were you a shock\nTo know I we weren't really shocked I I went before he was nominated and it'll alarming because mainly because of the extent to which I couldn't communicate with his supporters nice people we had a good time it was like a like a Jimmy Buffett concert help music you know it's just [noise] but then\n[noise]\nBut when you got right down to it we we liked each other but we didn't persuade each other so I've I've come to think that when you look at Lincoln\nYou you really learn what we all know which is to be a human being as you get older the goal is to get more loving\nLess sure of yourself more comfortable of ambiguity more generous you know Lincoln did the current administration it seems locked in this kind of incompetent mode of fearful mess and distrust and that's really weird is really not what we're about as a country except\nSome thirty eight percent think it is so alarming you know and as an artist so I think if you step towards everything with sympathy as your first move you actually get more information\nYou know and then when you get more information you're actually a better adversary if you have to be one so I I think is actually a time when people who are open minded in large hard it can do both things resist furiously and a love uncontrollably and that's actually where we're going to get out of this mess [noise]\nUh well now it's time for me to turn the audience against you\nWere talking of George Saunders now you you got your graduate degree in and literature when you were I think around thirty but before that you actually graduated from the Colorado School of mines and worked in oil exploration I did\nYeah guys [noise]\nWhen did you when it's mine's Muslims [noise] they have got to get a bigger scientists that is so confusing in the fact that the two schools are next to each other as very [noise] when when did\nYou sort of realized that you are not you know oil exploration was not for you and were you in your heart a sort of writer at that time to just doing something you thought was maybe a a job that you can make a living\nAnd I kind of realize that the first week of classes because I I had been a really bad student in Chicago wasn't going to go to college and I had these two teachers Linda Holmes who intervened and actually called the school and got me and so and I love them so much and I want I got there I realized that uh\nI had to not flunk out because I flunked out there I was going to go back to the starting line in Chicago in you know ... circle the ball so even though I could feel I wasn't good at it as you get this is a real turning point you've got to stick it out so I did and then I went to Asia I worked in the oil fields and I'm actually it was okay and I was writing a little\nAnd then uh I had a thing where I I was trying to do a Hemingway thing so I went swimming in Sumatra river after some drinking and with and with no closed it's like you know that thing that'll sure are uh [noise] but then I was swimming in ... there was a an oil pipeline along the river and on the river there like four hundred monkeys and I'm ...\nAre you know I'm like how I Wonder if that's okay [noise]\nWasn't really deathly ill for about three years uh gave up the job and came home and started writing\nSo loud that is expected that story to be going [noise] but it was\nWhat I tell my students you know swimming approve the river and you'll know\nWell yeah you you you teach\nYou teach a and the M. F. a program in Syracuse um and and I wanted to get your take on on the state of things there are one is there a particular piece of writing advice that you find yourself giving to your students like more than any other piece of advice\nYeah so what I Try to tell them is that there's actually this whole beautiful thing called revision like radical revision that if you're trying to find your voice is your best friend you you aren't necessarily your totality when you just talk you know if if we both stand up there and just talk\nIt there's some indication if we are but when you go back and start trimming not talking cutting it down to its essence that's another way that you can you can weigh in so to me there there was a great line um I think Robert Frost said this at a public talk some student ask them a complicated question about this on it and he said young man don't worry work\nThat's pretty good now I tell a story and then was frost expert pulled me aside of the readings that he didn't say that he said he said he said don't work worry\n[noise] I like it better the way you have it so yeah yeah do you feel encouraged\nAbout the you know next generation of writers I mean are they doing things just differently than than than your generation can conceive of because of the way that they've communicated with each other because of age\nYou you feel a little bit of that but what what the best thing about my job is every fall and we meet a new group of young people and it just makes you realize that that ... talent is eternal it as an old person you you will get into that ... if you're you know if your mind as a singer it tends to tighten over time you know\nThe [noise]\nIs that a result of the monkey river that happened to you\nBut when you but when you see these young people are like you know if I think if I ever find myself saying these kids today it's just my mind being stupid you know so I Am so cheered by by senior been traveling around the country\nTo the generation the young generation now is unbelievably uh compared to what I was on obstructed and Loving Out I'm very hopeful about the future [noise]\nWell I think they're in good hands with George Saunders teaching them George thank you so much [noise]\n\nBut now I'm older like we would go for mystery rides and you don't have a lot of money you y'all hop in the Chevy that blows purple smoke when the door for us won't work and you drive through at least with no headlights on in your mother says you're\nThen you're like where she like we're in a shopping center but you don't know where we are\nAnd now I like I appreciate and love that that's how you know that's what we had you know\nUm you you also have a you've written for television I Know that you have projects that are in development and you act as well ... ... is there one of these things that you like you feel like you have a sort of special aptitude for you a standup comic who actually you an actor who got into stand up comedy\nI'm a human being whose so lost in this world I Will do anything for the appreciation of other people [noise]\nWhatever else really comes down to [noise]\nI Know every single day I'm like so I just stopped doing stand up I I it's the most shallow for you know it's like a very sometimes is good and then like acting is something that's fun but I don't really think I'm not good honestly I don't think anyone is that good I think ten percent of people who are ... are good everyone else's again who can everyone can do that [noise]\nThat's just the facts that Daniel Day Lewis and then there's like All right everybody else you know what I mean [noise]\nI mean let's be honest\nI'm so acting as whatever um I really enjoy writing but it's a lot of work you know one really wants to work that hard\nUltimately if I could do anything I Would open up a little general store and like I have a bell on the door and I'd serve coffee in the morning and I'd pick up my kids from school and then like make dinner and they go back to the store and then you know you know when you get\nYour you know that's an achievable dream you know it's not I've been trying to buy this one place in my neighborhood and the guys like I Want seven hundred grand I'm like what are you on your mind to seven hundred grand\nSo you actually walk into the store and we're like a can I buy this story from you well\nFirst I met his wife and I realize they weren't doing so well you know what I mean\nShe was loose lips about it you shouldn't have been\nThen I got a husband [noise] I got him on the\nPhone wrote a proposal that he's like why don't you come and have a meeting with me comes in he tells me they're skimming off the top they're not even important so I Can't get a I went for a small business loan I Can't get a small business loan when he's telling me they're making two hundred and twenty grand a year but your report and forty helping me wait so like they are located at two to\n[noise]\nBut guess what everyone's cheating in lying and stealing that's you know what I mean it's like what are we not these fine public radio listeners eyes\nHave you sent the text messaging the last two weeks then you probably lied\nBecause it's the easiest way to live now you just like oh yeah I Can't be there I guess you can't you're a liar [noise]\nWhat do you have to tell people to their face you didn't live as much now I make up ... I'm like well I Can't because I have to be with the kid but I'll say something like ... making gym just because it sounds more fun [laughter] I'm like oh let's have an interesting life J\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from community minded Fenton family dealerships serving keen swan CSI and all of Chester county giving back to the community for over Thirty years ... dealerships dot com\nAnd we call it live wire you like it [noise]\nAgain the lawyers are limited hit the non accredited part hard because like live where you make Trump University looked like Harvard just that's the level of education you might get here or this week uh Jay we've got a pop quiz for you know we've been talking about personal ...
