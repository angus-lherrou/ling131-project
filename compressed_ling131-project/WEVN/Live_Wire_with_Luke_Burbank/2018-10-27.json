got a great show in store for you are theme on live wire this week is letting go we're going to be talking to Tommy Pico\nHe has a poet he wrote an entire book length poem about trying to let go of a relationship that didn't work out of also got ... low the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist or he profiled is someone who had to let go of everything they've grown up with\nBut when you hear what that was\nYou realize they made the right call I we've also got comedian Emily Heller here and we have got music from Portland zone he Leo sequins\nLetting go is something that I tend to have a hard time with it whether the topic is something really big or even something kind of small in fact on my way to record this episode of live wire I had\nLike a little run in at the airport that I had a hard time letting go of I was telling our announcer Elaine ... about it at the beginning of the show on let's actually pick it up right there on stage at the Alberta rose theater in Portland, Oregon\nThis very day I was in the airport is flying down here to do the show and I went through security and my bag was passing through the scanner and it got flagged\nThey made an announcement over the loudspeaker we needed somebody to look at this bag they pulled it out they took everything out of the bag wiped it all down and couldn't figure out why the scanner went off\nFinally the guy realized it was because I have a water bottle like a clean canteen water bottle and it had and I'm not exaggerating\nFive molecules of water still in it\nLike I had actively dumped out the water\nBut there was some residue in there and the guy said yeah you can't have that water wow and I looked at him and I said you know for the safety of this flight I Am willing to dump out the water\nAnd I'm not gonna take it on a plane with me uh so where do I do that and he said security rules are you can't do that on this side of security\nYou have to go back out to the other part of the airport dumped pure water out all five molecules get back in line and then come back through security\nBut he said he said or you can just leave the water bottle here but but I just bought it it was like twenty dollars [laughter] I'm pretty sure this is a scam by the TSA to get free water bottles and free ... plus over three ounces because there's always just like dead soldiers\nLined up from people who didn't want to and I was like you know what I'm putting the system on trial I Am going to do this I'm going to take the water bottle out through security and come back in and I was like can I leave my bags or he was like absolutely not try to get my bags back get my water bottle go out\nFind a bathroom dumped out the\nFive molecules of water wait in line come back through and the whole time I was going through security just mean mugged at TSA guy [laughter] like I Am not letting this go and I haven't cause I'm Talking about on the show right now you know honestly though it's not even that guy's fault he's bits the protocols the procedure you just doing his job and that's the part of my brain that I Wish would be able to identify\nThat he is not the enemy he's just has a job\nBut I couldn't let it go ... how are you at ... please tell me some person in this radio duo is good at letting things go because it's not me no I'm terrible oh All right\nOr you can you read something from metropolitan for sure are this is Tommy Pico reading for major pollen\nFrom nature poem I Can't write in nature poem\nBecause that conversation happens in the hall of South American peoples in the American museum of natural history between two white ladies and buttery Shaw as they pass a display case of traditional garb from one tribe or another it doesn't really matter to anyone and that

audience here at the Alberta rose theater in Portland or to tell us about something they've had a hard time letting go of and you end up ... you've been collecting those up what are you seeing a\nYou had a hard time letting go of four pounds of bacon in my freezer [noise] it's been there for years but managers special ed Fred Myers can't pass up a good deal deals with like four exclamation points after it [laughter]\nI can totally relate to that there's a part of my freezer that\nHumanize have not even be able to look upon it for the last six years it's frozen over I think there is some old drum sticks like not like the band was using but like ice cream cones there might be like a Trader Joe's India and the ... down in the bottom of it\nNo ice cream would ever a fall into freezer disrepair in my house really yeah no I mean really you don't even need a freezer when you bring home ice cream and eye out for me to do you have one more yeah here's one from I I think then and then in a has had a hard time letting go of over thinking\nIt took me twenty minutes to decide on this [laughter] [noise]\nI was in and is here with whoever spilled wine on their car to assist that would be a good combo\nThis is live wire radio we are talking about letting go this week what about the idea of letting go basically every thing that you were raised to believe\nThat is exactly what a guy named Derek Black did when he decided to turn his back on wait for it the white nationalist movement it was a movement his father helped create\nHis journey of letting go is detailed in a series of articles in the Washington Post by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist ... now ... has turned those articles into a book titled arising out of hatred please welcome ... [noise]\nYou know I was going to live where thanks great to be here um how did you first meet this got dark black\nSo I was writing about doing roof for the Washington Post and Don roofing committed the hate crime murder of about a dozen people at a historically black church in Charleston South Carolina\nAnd doing roof it spent time on this website called storm front and which I'd heard of but I didn't know very much about so and trying to understand the things that don't ... had been reading to sort of motivate him for this massacre I went on storm front and started reading this site it's the\nThe largest racist website in the world and has been for two decades running\nAnd the biggest threat on this website there were plenty of people saying you know horribly celebratory sings about Dylann Roof\nBut the biggest threat was about somebody named Derek Black and so I clicked on it and started to read and learned pretty quickly that Derrick black was the rising air to not only this website but also to this movement in the United states he was the son has a founder of this message board the godsend of David Duke he'd been raised\nAnd David Duke for those of you who fortunately don't know who that is yeah you're lucky he's a former grand wizard of the KKK\nYeah exactly and he had sort of made this guy dark black his protege and Derek being really smart and ambitious had been disastrously successful in mainstreaming a lot of these terrible idea she'd been elected to office by the time he was Twenty years old he had a\nTo what kind of office to a Republican\nAre not yet in West Palm Beach Florida which is a pretty diverse place uh\nLet me ask you a little bit about this sort of storm front thing and how related to this movement between what a lot of people would call white supremacy or the idea of being a white supremacist and something called the white nationalism because\nI Would think those are the same thing but actually dirt blacks dad was a big part of trying to move from white supremacy to white nationalism what's the difference\nSure that they worked really hard to change the language of this movement to try to sanitize it from a history of bloodshed but I think the truth distinction that is helpful between white supremacy and white nationalism is white supremacy unfortunately is endemic to what the United States has been historically and is today and\nWe're all still living in a country\nThat was built unfortunately on a lot of white supremacist ideals\nWhite nationalist I think properly identifies\nA smaller group of people who are trying to separate races on different continents as there and go\nBut like the idea to was that this guy they're black his father founded this website and was trying to make kind of an intellectual argument like be this sort of thinking persons racist\nYeah I mean he Derek father had also been the head of the clan for a decade in the United states and eventually decided it was more effective to build a gigantic website and eventually to ban all slurs from that website there's no Nazi insignia\nNo racial slurs what they've tried to do is instead of speaking all the time horrible things about people with color and Jews is instead they're trying to speak to unfortunately the fairly widespread and factually incorrect sense of grievance that exist in part of white America\nI'm this kid they're black and I just kind of a passive observer to this like his dad is starting this website and he is going into forums on the Internet and popularized in his words like white genocide and things like that when did he actually start to realize that maybe this was not a good way to be living his life\nNot until he went to college and the ... in many ways had been indoctrinated with a lot of these ideas everybody who he lived with believe these things and had made it the costs for their lives and they pulled Derek out of the public schools\nAnd kept him sort of in the confines of white nationalism and that's where his childhood exist that he was the keynote speaker at all these white nationalist conferences\nFrom the time he was ten years old so only in the first time that he got out of that world and began bumping into the people who are often the victims of his prejudices did any of his ideas begin to shift and that was when he was Twenty one years old went to the best college and the cheapest college in Florida\nHappened to be a super liberal place which Derek didn't quite realize until they got their hands and a pretty quickly on campus realized that if people knew who he was he would be ostracized or\nMaybe soon I'll get my braces off get my period who know\n[noise]\nBut I've been reading more about it you know when I'm short spurts and\nThen it turns out that one of the things that's supposed\nTo really help with ADHD is regular exercise which was devastating news\nUm [noise]\nSo I joined a gym my gym membership came with a free personal training session and I was like oh well that sounds like that sucks a but it was free so I went and I said listen here's what we're gonna do you're going to show me how to use these machines without blocking my head\nAnd then you and I are going to part ways for the rest of our lives and he said I totally get it but first we do need to do a questionnaire about your fitness goals and I was like oh I feel like it should be clear from that last thing I said\nThat I Do not have fitness goal my fitness goal was\nTo join a gym and I did that already so I kind of feel like taking the rest of the year off if I'm being honest\nAnd he was like it's not that big a deal I just want you to tell me what it is you're hoping to get out of this and I was like okay I guess I Would like to improve my posture my stamina\nMy general energy level\nAnd he goes okay great and your goal weight and I was like oh I'm not a political\n\nAnd he was like you don't want to lose weight and I was like no I Do not and he got this look on his face that told me that what he was thinking was but I can see [noise]\nUm [noise]\nJoking and it's nothing against\nAny of you if you want to lose weight there's nothing wrong with that I think I used to want to do that when I was younger and then what happened was I gained forty pounds and then I started making a lot of money and having a lot of sex and\n[noise]\nThe weight is why that happened and\nI'm just saying I don't want to jinx it [noise]\nSo I don't want to lose weight and he goes [noise] looking in the mirror [noise]\nThere's nothing you want a\nChange I was like I don't know maybe like the person I'm Talking to you right now\n[noise] to\nPut it this way he's very frustrated at this point let me put it this way if you lost weight\nWould that be okay with you [noise]\nAt that point it was clear to me that he was not going to let me leave there\nFrom the Ghostbusters [noise] so I decided to throw\n'em a bone I was like I'll give you this ever since I put on weight about a little bit more meat in my neck is made breathing a little bit harder than it used to be from certain positions when I'm lying down on the couch\nI guess if that improved I'd be fine with it [noise] and the oh my God\nYou guys he were still really if he was just like okay so we want to lose some weight and he wrote it down and we couldn't move over\nIt's crazy I'm Still so mad about it\nI'm mad at\nMe right because I missed an opportunity to just walk in there and be like oh yeah my goal wait\nI guess like ... plus\nFive hundred of 'em\nPounds but I only want to gain it from the waist up is that possible I Want to be a perfect circle\nKnow neck anymore neck gone same size legs is basically I Want to look like the sexy green ... can you make that happen\n... it's been a big year\nUm I got married recently a hold your applause I didn't want to uh [noise] it was for health insurance [noise] um [noise] I didn't even post about it on Instagram so I'm not sure it's legally binding um\nI met I met my husband online it's where I Do all my shopping I've Amazon Prime too so it was like two days so fast [noise] I'm just kidding it took forever\nAnd I met a million monster he said it was the worst it was like trying to beat Super Mario it was just like monster after monster or just like turtle mushroom wizard just like over and over\nAnd over again [noise] and so I eventually found the princess [noise]\nThe reaction I think I get is like when I introduced my husband and one of my friends and they find out that we met on line there like\nYou met him online but he he's the normal and nice\nYou won the lottery I'm always like how\nDare you [laughter] I did online dating for years before I met my husband winning the lottery takes one day no skill\nThat analogy does not properly honor my resilience [noise]\nHave any idea how many men's opinions I had to listen to before I met him [noise] how many conversations I had\nAbout ... you know [noise] it was just the one conversation but I had it a hundred times [noise] I guess what an end at the same way every time with me saying yeah\nI haven't seen that one either [noise] and once you get to the date before the date there's the profiles and the messages when you're a straight woman online dating\nYou just have to read a bunch of personal essays by on accomplished men it's the worst book club you've ever joint [noise]\nSo no I didn't win the lottery that doesn't\nDescribe my experience what happened was I ate at a restaurant that gave me food poisoning\nFor years [noise] and then one day I
