a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we will ... enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bus before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh wars that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nThink so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes\nOr perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise] um and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all information out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate ... did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was well so she\nStory she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople basically two days of cooperation were her therapist notes which seemed to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes\nTo the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot ...\nLet me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bus you forward a sincere a book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all that's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence [noise]\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what happened I was gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise]\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail\nCell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ... making the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise]\n[noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from\nThousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is jumbo Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor of Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts of that story or some other things which is\nThe extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nKeep it in the family and so when when Fred\nSeveral hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance and gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald ... over the years I built what I built myself\nHow how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that if Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is set on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you that you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred\nA large portfolios buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate and everything in the times reporting suggests\nThat that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it\nAll of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo at most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps\n[noise] there are less than five

now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah we'll but when you choose a politician to being a politician though that's not much of a surprise visits I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did do that to him yesterday on\nThursday we'll tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Monday and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday\nThat didn't really go well so on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of sexual assault and ask\nThem how they plan to vote and he said our way he he was very engaging the conversation he had to step out of the room but did it back for like ... you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely engaged she has got a question um I Do believe that Joe Manchin cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers and two\nAre fight does continue to sell uh as far as the Senate goes he ... he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had it because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis and so he\nKinda surely doesn't believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows that\nSemi ... camp though this is your opinion with me underscore\nIs my ... of course this is my opinion yes of course um so yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well\nIt does continue or yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to change things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell it it it sounds as if you of excepted senator mansions vote for what it is and and still support among the great many issues and I got to tell you this this sounds very civilized and democratic to me\nI'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the AC a and tax reform so badly we still have to go with him and hopefully get somebody else a twenty twenty four\nTaylor Wilson of West Virginia thanks so much thank you\nThe protests on Capitol Hill coming years since the

they don't grow up in a culture where they think it's okay to like give these girls and boys the voice to say like this was not okay I'm not going to tolerate in\nWomen aren't tolerating it either and the results are measurable this year a sexual harassment reports to the EEOC or equal Employment Opportunity commission have gone up twelve percent that's after years of remaining stabbing\nThe EOC is

do of the thousands of sexual harassment reports that come in only a fraction get funded for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them for five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time so some of those women are out of time\nSome of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's a matter of people coming forward and we connect into lawyers and the lawyers helped them when they can but sometimes there isn't something that can be done\nYou got a

rivalries in sports a Yankees Red Sox the Sox won last night five four but Boston at the battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox did the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because\nThis is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching the Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ... Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded basis lives in the seventh inning and if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic ...\nA Houston Astros put the crunch on Cleveland's seven to two Couric looper a great pitcher got clue or clubs you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is the okay the red Sox won a hundred may games the Yankees won a hundred games\nBut the actual still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team\nWith the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot about a lot a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but then that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut up against the Atlanta Braves and yeah this\nIs interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the playoffs by Tuesday night\nAnd you won't let me forget that but go ahead\nNow I've just saying that it's it's a crazy here and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out well the Dodgers have a National League champs they went to the seventh game with the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you you have a problem with that I kinda like with the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the ropes merit to that and maybe you go to Colorado When things change but I\nI really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFind that we need to mention a twenty games suspension or in hockey Tom Wilson other cap shit Oscar sunkist or the blues on his Blind Side ... yeah NHL seems to be reacting to to head concussion\nMore no they're not reacting or they don't seem to be reacting they're reacting in there essentially sending the message that Tom Wilson to dirty player it's not just the fact that he had some cars in in ... in the head it's also that this is his\nFifth is his fourth suspension in the last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy when he gets on the ice is out there to hurt people and the one of the things we always talk about with football is the danger but the thing we don't talk about is that hockey is just as dangerous and the guys that come in at a pretty high rate of speed\nAnd when you look at that the suspension now they're they're not playing around in their concluding this guy does not belong on the ice\nOr Brian thanks so much thinking he's part man part
