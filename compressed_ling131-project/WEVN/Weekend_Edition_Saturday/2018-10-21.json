edition from NPR News I'm Lucas the end of our good morning it's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years\nAnd the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul dozens are dead but the vote went on and to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer class she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here and there\nWere people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away you know despite the threat from Islamic state and from the Taliban\nOn Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote certainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated tell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside the of conducive city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongmen on the outskirts of cobble\nA brought his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent other people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections\nThe Afghan government has announced it's arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful science though this time around as the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage\nThat has held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nBriefly what is it signified of the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country in conflict to conflict at the United states is involved and\nIt is and there was a lot of controversy about whether this vote should be held at all\nBut Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going for with this vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision\nThat's going to be a Wednesday evening at seven and you can track all of our election coverage had an H.

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or us how she might have so\nThey're just going to maybe both just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and then they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from coastal main botanical gardens in booth they main presenting gardens a glow a nighttime self guided

are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities\nAnd it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the ... the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty cents is that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big wave for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night massacre\nPresident Nixon had ended the Justice Department having let go of

again here's Ron Elving NPR senior editor and correspondent with the story of the Saturday Night massacre it's why we call him professor on\nThe Democratic National Committee was trying to solve a mystery\nMost Americans alive today hadn't even been born in Nineteen Seventy two year five men were discovered inside the Democratic National Committee headquarters and arrested\nFive and Harry

story began to trickle out things to to Washington Post reporters who pursued it when few others were paying much attention Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\nNixon was re elected in a landslide that

like you who donate to this NPR station\nThis this weekend edition from NPR News I'm Luke Garcia Navarro head of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas in a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival ... as long you\n\n\nThe shelf hasn't escapes scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nWhat's your name is Raphael you know you go by kid that's an NGO size version of it he was the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can overuse identity and we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other why people are different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still methods in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political complex I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them as they should be able to get their kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best view on on the grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity in politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or co opting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should on to your question directly gingerly constantly\n[laughter] I I think you you can easily go wrong hair I mean one of the things that the president is currently during his mobilizing identities in a very divisive why and lean down a terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds\nAnd um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together or through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that\nI don't as much as political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody or one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that in an election reserved and then whoever wins or when you sort of gather behind in order for around the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a real noticed concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nYou know I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities then we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most in ... I think that every concession is not coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identities because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nHere by the question is whether you can do that with our boat you go rattling recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies\nDemocracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lies that bind me thinking identity thank you very much like you very much\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to to use\nIn the complete cookbook for young chefs NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef as she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nEight year old Lucy Gray is wide eyed and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in chief\nOf the night she so good to meet you were a little excited\nLucy likes to cook and has helped make some meals for her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself\nThe cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pot pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes in a ... and she takes a diesel Lucy decides to taste it\nGoes what are the\nNasal [laughter] at\nOne point while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nFalls is why cable and that's it it says she SP which is the abbreviation for peace and this is one capital T that such and let me ask you something in line at the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language in the kitchen yet you call it\nIncluding kitchens beach there's so many words and these recipes that you just don't know until you hooked on it so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the basics with everything from photographs of tools and equipment\nMen's and chop this recipe calls for a chopped onion the first it has to repeal\n[noise] with his son is [noise]\nYou like let's say the cookbook\nEmphasizes safety in the kitchen which Birnbaum demonstrates went shopping the onion it can be hard\nTo make this first Koch so yeah you see on my fingers are like this all ... and that means that my fingers are never going to get accidentally under the night so this is the safe way to hold a knife and if any anything\nPrep were finished it's time to cook beginning with those chopped onions\nSoon as we want to start the onions pretty frequently you don't have to do it [noise]\nYou know sell things [noise]\n... after an and garlic Lucy pours into tomatoes only ...
