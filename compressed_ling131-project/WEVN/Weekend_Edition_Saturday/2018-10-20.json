affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership Mr ... thanks so much for being with us go out to be here based on all of your experience just as Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president of how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the\nBrits and the French do supply weapons as well to to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there was a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of\nSaid that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn around elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our Foreign Relations we need to hold up\nThe moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy\nSurely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we named\nTop two weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nSo during the for profit isn't new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War but American mercenaries working for foreign powers\nThat something that they were ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news joined us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare at the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented\nYeah you're right in the article that to the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects so of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them uh the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed a by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in eight and twenty Fifteen\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans maybe CEO veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the aid\nAnd all this law is that right is very important political party in Yemen to this llamas party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group unless the UAE e as we writes a hired this company to kill this local political leader\nThe LA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically yet is it a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nAnd I guess I'm among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries\nBut it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nYou've seen how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are not ... a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is against the law ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or oh they're the only ones who've done this or there are other countries who try it um are there other Americans\nOther than the ones and our other Americans who believe you've uncovered yet right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there are several reasons one is a there's a lot of money involved but they also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the u._s. is doing U.S policy the U.S has not spoken out against the

was sixteen years old and production ... high school party\nA drug to cold of her life\nShe was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal ... died on October seventh she was Thirty years

sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect to real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nYou're drug ... more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry that hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so\nLet's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be

I mean there last year because of your\nYour cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that this is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series in Nineteen eighty two\nAnd of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want to know the the course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season in Boston in Boston that's right and it would be a weight exactly yes and a Christian taller debuted as an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards\nShe's also she'll playing in the NBA for their mistakes Becky Hammon of course is already in assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nYeah I think it's coming and I think is overdue when I make I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another unnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the NBA NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA has been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having\nFemale referees the NBA's been better with my colleague Doris work on the broadcast and so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in\nThat we do here I Want to know gifts [laughter]\nNo and in in that sport it's a big deal in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and hit a storm and Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important in these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um it's it's going to be good women's\nTennis association championship start tomorrow in Singapore But there's gonna be a rule change it Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more of those six hour final ... what do you think of the rules change to go to the uh what what what are they going to do it the highbrow break yeah\nAfter twelve after twelve twelve then they're going to go to a tie break the way that the way that they do after the U.S open after after the ...\nI think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they didn't get to a big deal and I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nServe [laughter] of Howard thank you you're in San
