Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors over the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country\nBut this year the GOP is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to drop congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them\nWhat states are you watching heading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nSo there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he is a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but the Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's a mixture of things you've really unpopular

many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott her favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a

areas\nAs we see more and more powerful storms hitting us it has many thinking about how to make the nation's power grid more resilient NPR's Jeff Brady reports\nIn Panama City Florida right now this is a common sense [noise]\nPeople who were lucky to have them or using gas powered generator until utility crews to fix all the downfall and wires and restored their electricity bay county emergency services chief mark Bowe\nAnd says that will be a long slow\nSystem was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive Scott parents and that the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive parents and organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about\nOne in ten that data accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says that they more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce in a line of attack it can actually be much more we take our line right now and ... and an overhead why\n... says in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure\nShe says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient one thing ... would like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and batteries at places like water treatment plants hospitals\nAnd facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we all need to be ... restraint chain of ensuring that critical infrastructure of a population it keep the lights
