water again that at our toilets full flash we're working on getting hot and that we understand the basic needs\nHundreds of thousands are without power from the Florida Panhandle into Virginia the storm is now blamed for at least fourteen deaths NPR's Joel Rose has in Miramar Beach Florida Joel thanks for being with us Scott what is the situation\nWell as you mentioned there are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and the gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations that do have gas there very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it's getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which is like there\nIt's a small city about thirty seven thousand residence 'em before the storm on it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico it's not a luxurious town I mean the houses are set pretty close together\nAnd right now it's like every block is is that almost like a scene from a disaster movie like either trees down there are wires in the street seems like every building sustained some kind of damage\nOr either to the roof or to the walls I mean I saw a church\nThat was missing two of its walls and and you could just see from the pews right out into the the blue sky outside um churches schools public buildings hospitals all of this has sustained a lot of damage a and I think it's starting to really down and folks to this is going to be a very long recovery\nRight now fourteen the deaths of fourteen people have been reported and confirmed but I gather nobody there are things such as that the final word\nUnfortunately no I mean I I think people do think that the death toll is likely to rise so far officials here have been pretty tight lipped they don't want to release numbers until they've finished the search and rescue process a bay county emergency chief mark bowling was asked yesterday about the number of fatalities here's what he said\nWhat we have is a lot of people missing I Want to be very careful about numbers because are they missing because their loved ones can contact them or are they missing because they were you know perished in the storm\nAnd when he says loved ones are missing or can't contact them it's a it's true that cell phones are not working very well not only in Panama City but all over bake county so it remains really difficult to communicate and find relatives who may have stayed behind it in the storm\nMostly clear overnight low thirty

Catholics no ... is a young man who grow up in Pennsylvania and one of Donald worlds diocese and moved to Washington DC this summer he joins us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and\nMost of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person and I think it has that effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you know\nIt hurt reading the report because I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense\nWhat I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was a thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church\nHurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMay I ask did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh\nWho has their own story to do no I Do not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\n[noise] do you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops in people whose names are plastered up on church building back in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up\nJust to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise] instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care\nDo you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to new areas in starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of all of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I\nStill have a face and I just see much less of the connection between my personal faith and the Catholic Church\n... now of Washington DC thanks for speaking with

Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut they're right on the practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we face up\nTo the outside world your mother or a progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around nine or ten she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because\nWhen I Would face or police or why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to get progressive Lee worse and I think that the beating my mother was taken from life\nFrom our town and her partner also started to give her aggressively worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the beat in June to or from your mother the ... the she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing costs just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I thing led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have\nTo deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em ending eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide in the symptom and disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of veer between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nThat the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of run ins with police us about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear enough thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be OK lead people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah [noise] then we got to get the gambling how does

back on Greg Allen NPR News Appalachia cola Florida\nIn Georgia a number of civil rights groups are showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state the camp is also a Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman with member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the region or regions these applications are being held up\nThese are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government data bases so basically works like this right you have\nA hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under camps office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has isn't it\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she said everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy\nI'm On the other side ... campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating the base is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all about who's going to actually show up
