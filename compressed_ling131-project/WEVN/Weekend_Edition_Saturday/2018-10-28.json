going to take a look at this moment when things are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to assault\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nOr we'll Schachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice turning the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because Batman was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo piece position on health care\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the universe\nKind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders oh we've had moments of turmoil I'm thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view [noise]\nThe phenomena are we seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over people ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and have Hillary voters\nAnd vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls for major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ...

I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum\nHas been in the news is you know um you have actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions\nAre in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect on how\nWe as individuals view an entire group of people absolutely\nYeah so in in one reason study with Renee floors who the sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about\nThe many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America it's not hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chamber of whoever consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the types of ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservative held and yet\nBy rolling green nursery in Greenland or fall color from bombs angel's perennials trees and shrubs abound for patios at landscapes warm days and cool nights fall is for planting\nNovember thinks is fast approaching and candidates are crossing the state\nSpeaking with voters I like his message I like his background is my first time being able to vote just turned Eighteen in may so important thing is two to three million with all the candidates are more fish than for however\nYou are or make sure you're following the news you need to make an informed decision and everything they tuned to NPR for all our election coverage\nAnd each dereliction coverage funded in part by gossip in immigration law and the New Hampshire school administrators association [noise]\nSupport for an age VR comes from you our listeners and from UNH is NBA programs online fulltime at a part time in Durham and Manchester learn more at the November seventh information session details and application at NBA dot UNH dot edu [noise]\nAreas of mourning drizzle and showers or this morning then cloudy with a high in the mid forties today\nFor tonight mostly cloud are you a chance of more showers for the low around thirty six now Monday morning some showers are likely with a high forty nine Monday Night mostly cloudy and thirty four\n[noise]\nYou're listening to weekend edition and this is New Hampshire public radio [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from battle the European made language learning program battle teaches practical conversation in Spanish French German and other languages available in the app store or online at the a B.

these like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in their community and I I remember thinking well it's not possible to stand would than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population does not in\nRural America for decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years now ... agrees\nA few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jails and saw that is\nVery very very very sick people because detox from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts in the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand what is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the\nOpioid epidemic as if it were a natural disaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic snow how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way [noise]\nThe idea grew out of their

everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic county leaders took the idea\nAnd ran with it is now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special

smaller pieces like distributing needle cleanup cats and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction this\nKnow let's stick so if you set an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in either in any of our lifetimes 'em by breaking it down like he didn't an elephant you just can eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and others in the community an steps to reduce overdoses with

[noise]\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well\nWhat we know is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers\nThe names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by of course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning and this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns are engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members on from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranked ... in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think there's a dark myth Hitchcock dot org to learn more\nStarting with Hitchcock whose here\nIs not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil again eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying\nOne of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades yeah\nAnd we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like every one is really um grappling with this and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner and and this is just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nYeah but I didn't mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen ... so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's\nUm and ... and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise uh throughout this community in Pittsburgh a cope with what's happened here this tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYeah ... incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nAnd it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless the president a President Trump\nA remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Senate God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years thing of Texas that actively carry out that's sentences but nonetheless the president is is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a\n... and said that this is he said essentially that this is a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm a ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I think\nAny situation than it and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant of motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that still under investigation but um it is being investigated as I as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happens and also we expect to know more about about the victims soon\nI'm we're going to bring in our Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara a good morning It's MORNING\nSo set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how oh we're actually starting this press conference and now I'm we're going to go there live here we don't\nOffer most heartfelt condolences and prayers to the victims of yesterday's senseless acts of hatred and violence to the families and friends and two groups were Jewish community and to the larger community service for\nJewish community of Pittsburgh is one that we as puts burgers treasure it's an important part of the cultural and social identity of Pittsburgh and so this was an attack\nUh and just a we're going to get through this and we're going to continue on and show with Pittsburgh is made up so thank you [noise]\n\nMorning I'm a doctor car Williams of the medical examiner chief medical examiner of Allegheny county and again I Want to reiterate what

communities to support our friends in the Jewish community\nWe um as I said it had been knocked down before but we've always been able to stand back up because we worked\nMoment to think those that spoke earlier the effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal to the state to the county to the local was something that we should all be proud of\nThe fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics we're at the scene\nOr medics deciding on their day off to voluntarily come in to fill seven additional ambulances to back up our officers and the officers who came from our surrounding counties\nThe federal agents in this state troopers and the county officers all working together in order to be able to make sure an episode\nThat will forever go down in the history of this city\nIs one of the worst moments that we have experienced was able to be less and because of that coordination\nInto those that are standing behind me who spoke early earlier\nThe professionalism that was exemplified through their leadership was something that we needed as our darkest time [noise] to our officers who are in the hospital into one officer who's been discharged the thanks for the entire city go to them\nThey're sacrificing their knowing of the danger that

to rationalize irrational behavior we will not try to figure out ways in order to lessen the degree of crimes such as this we will work to eradicate it we will work to eradicate it from our city from our nation in our world\nHatred will not have a place anywhere\nIn we won't work locally to make those changes happen and we'll work with partners around this country and around this world to make

morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case he's there say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida at the morning It's MORNING with the [noise]\nAll right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN his reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and bodybuilding and night life\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland the community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nIn say out begin making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a

here's what she said about his political thinking\n... that left he last Hitler Hitler\nWith Hitler That's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you living\n\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by ... Hannah Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise]\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority they're presented as a model with black voters think this\nBlack voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters what happens is we then tend to think that\nThe things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have tweeted frequently that when we\nSee something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white\nIn front of that statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\n[noise] I did a political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not\nSee white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so\nBy and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story\nIn our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country\nWhite voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely\nI'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things than fit when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country\nWhen I was clearly argue we're all biased\nI think the way that we covered the election showed that by to be very glaring we clear because we were ignoring miserably what voted on the ground were saying right ... voted on the ground where say", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Keene", "day": "28"}
