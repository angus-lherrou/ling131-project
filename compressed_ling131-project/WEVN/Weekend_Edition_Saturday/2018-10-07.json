from\n[noise]\nThat's\nThe president at a rally last night in Kansas will hear more about that elsewhere in the show but let's begin this hour with Molly ball she's a political analyst and time magazine's national political correspondent Molly Hi\nI said the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrats as sort of weaponized the me too movement for political gain and on the left many see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual\nTrump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women and now ... sitting Supreme Court justice where does\nThis leave the country well a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is ripping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt it ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow to use an analogy\nI you thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh\nUh left that was already a quite exercised particularly ... particularly women\nAnd uh on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\nI think I have no idea frankly [laughter]\nThis close to an election it's it's hard to tell what signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national sentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nA ... and the trajectory is still\nRemarkably as you said a those statistics

the Supreme Court like having a confirmation fight is now over but as NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Capitol Hill it ... it will likely linger over Congress and American politics for a very long time

been seen some of the cabinet confirmations a Senate taking on one of its most important and historic responsibilities running smack into hyper partisanship as well as a cultural reckoning with sexual assault before the vote majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer sounded like they were in agreement road\nThat led us here has been bitter angry and partisan\nA vote to confirm drug Scott ... is a vote to end this brave dark chapter in the center for\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged an aggrieved but for very different reasons Republicans saw character assassination old unproven allegations designed to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation Lindsey Graham's diatribe during the hearing on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations sum this up\nBest I Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this system out an ethical sham since I've been in politics\nDemocrats like New York's Kirsten Gillibrand saw Ford's claim Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school at the combination of the year old me too movement a referendum on whether women or believe when they report harassment or assault\nWe allow women's experiences of trauma second one man's commotion it will not only diminish watershed moment of societal change we are and it will bring shame and it's funny\nBut in the end Republican after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor Ford sincere testimony\nI Believe she has experienced a traumatic event\nThere is no evidence though\nThat judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked off a lot of other legislative business as the confirmation fight play out and even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bills\nBut while they differ on the root cause of what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage Republican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh\nHas a legislative branch [noise] we have an obligation to moral obligation to do better than this\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh Schumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election\nVote if you believe Dr Ford and other brave women who came forward and you want to vindicate their sacrifice\nVote Republicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post the whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh\nFor energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle there's about a month left to election day the big question now is which party is voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have\nAny of the justices said anything publicly about this not per se but just this is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into very big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex\nCovers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin replaces Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote\nAt the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like I'm closely\nContested cases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has\nConsequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate for the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power\nOr not NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thank you need us so very much\nThank you my name's Nicole ... who was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to say you know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because the story was all I knew and it was so important\nTo all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her career identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that the my race was a relevant\nThe word that the judge use was assimilate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody\nElse how's that different what what are the challenges you faced because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white Americans\nUh Joan jet documentary Thursday October eleventh it's seven

Saudi Arabia are at odds on the world stage and the accusation by Turkish investigators that Washington Post contributor ... was killed inside the Saudi conflict\nHas ratcheted up regional tensions the Saudis have strongly denied the allegations NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul now to sort through the story\nI'm good morning I look\nIt's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know Jamal to show he walked into the Saudi constantly Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needed some paperwork relating to a pending marriage to his Turkish fiance she waited for him outside holding his phone until well after the consulate closed ... says he never came out\nA Turkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record by an advisor to president ... on that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate are aired on says he said that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far\nAnd we haven't seen any evidence to back up this claim that show is dead just the persistent question if he's still alive where Izzie\n... what is the Saudis and saying well\nThe Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that the show he did come into the consulate Tuesday Afternoon or the Saudi press agency quotes officials saying he left the consulate\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News they're very keen to know what happened to him uh there's no evidence on the Saudi side whoever to show that she'll be actually did leave the consulate\nThe consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of ... he said the consulate has multiple exits but why would they show the lead by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting out front\nSo lots of questions this advisor to president air to one says he's convinced to plane loads of Saudis who arrived in this stumble on Tuesday the same day could show you went into the consulate were somehow involved he also says he doesn't believe the Saudi claims that there is no camera footage of fish Yogi either inside or leaving the council\nAlright two questions and the first one is um why is this important what does this mean for Saudi relations with turkey and with other world powers\nWell it could be very important but a lot will depend on what we learn from here on about to show these disappearance what happened to him that seems likely to be further blow to Saudi turkey ties are relations were already strained Turkey's been siding with another Persian Gulf states Qatar and a bitter dispute with the Saudis\nAre some are wondering what the American response is going to be a ... an important ally to the U.S does turkey
