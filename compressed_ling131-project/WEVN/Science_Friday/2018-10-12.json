less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated yet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure and how can we security systems\nHow does this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security\nHeading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five eight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\n... here and it's nice to have you um [noise] well I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire early what they were trying to do for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] the kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns\nAnd their emails those are those are two separate things or if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself or we saw them targeting\nA voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote 'em and um there were a phishing attacks against um [noise]\nUh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which ah manufacturers ... books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there was something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter]\nThey may still are not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them I'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and deal with registration databases\nOr electronic pull books or what you can kind of what our used they're often or a tablet or or or or computers that are used to check people in 'em and uh\nI checked I think they have they they moved in either direction we successfully breached but at least in one of the smaller indictments there was an indication that there was some dinner and it sounded like them that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine compromise [noise] well\nUm [noise] uh well that's actually quite a controversial question ... you mentioned\nUm well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped 'em um and making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines\nAnd systems um you know the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which I'm wary was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one\nStates um they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then they're they're voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners on that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to\nThe DEF CON um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known that um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the um what election officials will say is that first of all\nI'm In general the machines that have been broken into and def\nCon I'm either had been retired or in the process of being a retired and then secondly um that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them\nUm and you need some sort of inside job um that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and would easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against on the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nOur they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go\nWith one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election being there in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that\nThey're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic an accuracy testing we're doing\nThat um there were mistakes made\nI think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and they weren't mistakes in the programming so um so I I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines right now for\nTwenty Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks\nThat we see it DEF CON but it would but who it would be good for the state's the moving directions\nTo make it easier to demonstrate the skeptics that that was\nTrue I I if I could just jump in real ... point um [noise] I I I I I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there are there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and and it's an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states or that I Know of but in other countries ... election reporting attacks\nUm and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information

don't in\nDid it the RV an A. dot org\n... H. dot com [noise]\n\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen hundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote will below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point\nThe agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius\nBut how much does happen to agree on a bus from the most devastating impacts of climate change\nA new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change vi PCC this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts\nThat could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more the conclusion every bit of warming even that point point five degrees matters here to break down the report\nAnd tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is Dr Kelly the Vin she is senior associate with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you\nWant to send out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel Tour de one and a half degree increase in global temperature all your worries are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give ... give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to forty two five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at science friday\nI'm so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us but even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes\nYeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue at first for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and now is because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think of that small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to\nHarm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise] so what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius\nAnd they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nAnd and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference and ... for example\nSo for example on what they found is they look to cost a number of different systems and they found\nHeat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming\nOn at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further\nBecause you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth sea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees\nAnd while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses um two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming\nThree times worse for insects I'm\nAlmost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic I said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nDoesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the back to orange or a degree [noise]\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible\nUm there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened on right now a emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty instead we essentially need to have that amount\nAnd go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide\nPer year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century so this is a tremendous transformation and the composition rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about\nIt also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty or talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to make one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand increasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them we need\nYou know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can you can you answer at least who commissioned do what they do they use\nIs your show on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision on requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists and had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly review\nFor that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the times the implications for policy makers so in this case\nI'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report [noise] [noise]\nAh we're a lot of people want to talk about it but I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice [noise]\nYes hello so I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up confusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what really hurts\nUs in our culture is the high temperature is the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to yield are in the Central Valley of California\nOne tomatoes when the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this is really critical of are the highs not just the average temperatures\nAnd fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American forest grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientists will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel vial death\nOther things like that that will instill make us grow more\nPlants and we didn't have them for food feed and feel a part of you are you a farmer\nNo I'm a researcher actually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy super which makes food for food feed and fuel all the same maker and it uses little water and nitrogen\nYou know everybody thinks we're going to have some you know puts the two of the atmosphere what all the plants will take it up if we switched to the renewables using plants\n... let me get a comment
