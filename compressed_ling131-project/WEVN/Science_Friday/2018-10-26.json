B. R. dot org slash car donation\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Lisa Mullen\nI'm Peter O'Dowd and we're waiting for a news conference from the Justice Department just a few minutes from now will be learning new details in our top story today one person\nIs in custody in South Florida in connection with a series of suspicious packages mail to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump let's bring in Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent Carrie or tell us about this man who is in custody now in Florida\nNPR's identifying him as Caesar ... fifty six years old from South Miami as you said and his background includes a long wrap sheet a number of charges for related to drugs and fast\nAnd also charge in two thousand two for a threatening to throw place project or discharge and explosive device he also has a bankruptcy in his past and we also know he's a registered Republican you\nSaid that he has a district long criminal record and the police were aware of him would do we know what led them to him at this point in this investigation\nAnd we are going to wait to hear from the Justice Department the FBI the postal inspectors and others about what exactly are led authorities to this man so quickly this is a remarkably swift investigation as President Trump has already said this morning\nWe do know that a number of devices were not exploded so they were in ... in essence a mother load of evidence for the FBI lab in Quantico the FBI lab has been looking at whether there was any DNA are fingerprints on those devices we don't yet know whether this suspect may have left those traces which led authorities to him so quickly\nCan you talk about the fact that these bombs did not explode or was one of the big question leading up to this arrest was it on purpose that the suspect was ... you know just a bad bomb maker or was it um you know something else I'm sure that something investigators will be tracking\nA ... a authorities are likely to shed a little more light on that at the news conference I suspect but it's important to note that um as of yesterday the NYPD and federal authorities were advising anyone who came across such a suspicious package one of those manila envelopes\nTo treat it as if it were dangerous and to not touch it and not handle it call authorities and at the local level are called the FBI so it's not yet clear to me whether this person or if he is in fact the uh the bomber\nOr wanting to hurt somebody and just didn't know how or whether there was some other uh issue at play\nAnd has making these devices are once again we're talking to NPR's Carrie Johnson and waiting for federal officials at the department of justice to\nGive a news conference on the latest on the investigation into the male bombings that's happening at the bottom of the hour carry a the a rest do they expect that they're going to be making anymore do they have any idea if the man they arrested today was acting as as a lone\nWolf attorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday said that he is I'm expecting to bring to justice any and all people involved in this\nRight now we know that she's our say I guess the only person in federal custody I think it's the ... are going to be looking for a while yet to see if he had any help any assistance whatsoever we don't yet know the answer to that question what\nAbout the white van we saw pictures of it on the TV all morning long do we know that it belongs to the suspects because of course there were images\nOf the president the ... you know stickers bashing CNN visible in the window I mean it's very early in his investigation but do we know anything about why investigators a came and got to that than\nWe do know that Cesar ... was taken into custody in or near it\nThat shortly thereafter people with FBI jackets and other law enforcement were seen securing this white man and transporting it um possibly to evaluate it for ... century purposes or other purposes authorities have not on the record yet connected that van ...\nIs there any notion at this point as to whether or not he was considered armed or dangerous at the time or any uh arms apprehended\nOut we don't yet know the answer to that question we do know that there was a massive manhunt under way for this individual than involve federal and local authorities\nAcross multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers injured or hurt in any way in connection with that apprehension\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were awaiting this press conference from\nThe Justice Department are but for now let's turn to the political side of this of course it's a major part of this story a Republican strategist Alison Stewart is with us now Alice welcome to you thank you Peter great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and host\nAt hill TV Jamal Simmons high speed ... or ... or ALS want to start with you know have a suspect in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this it has been a very politically fraught past couple of days\nIt has been and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to\nThe FBI and law enforcement and those who put their their lives on the line to to make this apprehension so swift and I bring bring about a sense of calm and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very uh an intense time in in our politics I\nI I think if we're looking at this through the the political lens ... we have to give some credit to the president this afternoon who who did say that this is a time for Americans to unify\nAnd while we don't know the cause\nOf this or the motive of of this is a ... this is a time to bring the nation together and the president was was wise to say that anyone involved in this will be brought to justice in the face the full extent of the law and to rightly claimed and called this they despicable a despicable act\nOf political violence and it's time to\nHave peace in the United states\n... I'm Sorry I interrupted you do want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really want him to do I really want him to try um I I've been disappointed so far uh that every time he is spoken out on the street gives words that are about Seventy five so like so\nAnd then ... minutes or hours later he does or says or something that was to blame on the victims let the media or you know tries to lessen the some some way to make light of it in some way and I think\nThe president is job right now and not all of his job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president of do something well maybe he called President Obama may be called President Clinton and offered his is health and and and made sure that the FBI all the other\nSources disposal they were protected you know image toward the attorney general Jeff Sessions all ages older to make sure he was going to be okay this is the moment we're supposed to reach out and not just with words but also with actions well that's what\nThe president has has not apparently reached out to any of those do whom the on the the male bombings there were bombs were addressed um but I Wonder if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe the pro Trump ... stickers\nHardly a Trump supporter so how would you as a Republican strategist Alice advise leaders of the party to address\nIt more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and it was not in a favorable term and I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this happened the other day or at least once a week and it it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send a message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a non violent way and we need to do so in a calm way and uh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions\nBe heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say\nThat in my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top and it needs to be a firm in a consistent message and as your most editing need not be Justin word but also in actions\nWe're we're in here saying starting at the top meeting with the president a journal absolutely how do you think Democrats should deal with it\n[noise] or the Democrats would be the same way that is no time to play all the things I\nWa disagree with the rhetoric\nThat the president has been using for the last year and a half a couple of years regards the media lock her up and all the chance to all the things that we don't want to go through the mall I disagree with those I'm willing to say maybe he didn't know maybe he didn't understand the impact of those words maybe even if you did you never thought anybody would take\nActions upon those words I don't blame the president for the actions that have occurred but after those actions occurred the president now knows that those words have impact\nOf actually creating a lot at active devices could explode\nA this is obviously a way to terrorize people I'm just sort of get back at the other side if there is some sort of political motive which of course we don't know exactly the details yet so I think that's such a probably a big I'm a motivation there\nOkay I was with us if you can on NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department is remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions\nThe FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York\nAnd we know the FBI's New York field office has been particularly active we have a we have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nA we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderers row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact\nI have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time on stage at the Justice Department\nAsked for unanswered questions did he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's dire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed such a package and there may be other such devices out there\nWe've got to find that out a law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because\nThey fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate\nUm they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help and what he was planning next if anything as for motive it's not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked\nTo the suspect fifty six year old Cesar ... from South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after a prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been an address the use of e suspicious packages and that's one hint as to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nThat's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience where we stand now authorities arrested a South Florida man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump\nLaw enforcement has confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida and has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrests followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned the Democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages and he issued a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said I'm ... it's confirmed that a suspicious package mailed to Tom Steyer was intercepted had a male facility in California he says\nWe're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but\nOn our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity ah during this very dark period where many prominent Democrats had been at a recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices that was the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions\nThat you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far the the people who've gotten these packages had been critics of the president I'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next door that they're taking precautions in case they are\nI have been hearing from people former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking on yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days\nOf course on some of the targets or um or intended recipients of of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder\nThe former CIA director John Brennan\nThis morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence James Clapper and another one this morning in Florida intended for New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing and growing and it's not clear to me that were done yet without have\nAll those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all ... exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\n'em for the vast majority of those packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages you know the images that you've seen\nNPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former FBI special agent to teachers in the criminal Justice Department in Radford University in Virginia a new country there yeah I'm here yes\nSo you've seen on TV a lot of ... and had described as as Kerry just did what the packages of looked like\nIt at what point if there are packages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either this suspect or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe somebody who's a copycat as often happens in cases like these\nYeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know ... it's obviously a easy to get some of these materials that that it's a lot of materials or or the town and and so it's really going to take\nA a close look by law enforcement to confirm whether or not it is I'm the same suspect or copycat 'em so you know we're talking about um review of ... FBI a lab all back in the field office\nLooking at the actual forensics a so it's not going to be an easy call a quick\nCall until it's actually had a look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over yeah\nThat's that's a great question and then you know I I think as a as a couple of games so ... got a a ... show 'em if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have a sense of of hell for throwing is\nHow you know what his lowly age what else is out there the other thing is just as a collaborative and the electronic evidence is you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at his [noise]\nThat they give you a really good sense of what all he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or this caller's business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive the threats are so I Would say within the next\nYou know twenty four hours you're going to have search orange executed you're going to have a ... Asian or they should have a good idea of how small it was just going with this particular suspect but then there's all the question of again isn't working with someone else or tracking down any potential each other associates that made a healthy\nThat's ... special agent Luke William hunt a NPR's Carrie Johnson is it looks like it'd be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the arrest that happened today just very quickly we know that there was a white van with all sorts of political details apparently pro Trump ... spent details on the side of it do we know for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the suspect he was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding on the idea that it is somehow connected to the suspect that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when it's a news conference start as law enforcement decides to tell us\nWhat if anything this individual is charged with and how they know that\nAnd does he just like the individual you're talking about a fifty six years old ... Florida where he is he right now\nHe is in federal custody or he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as authorities are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety\nWe have gotten a warning that this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started with in the next few seconds to say thank you dilute William ... former FBI special agent thanks very much for your insights\nPleasure good to be here and Republican strategist Alice Stewart's hum we uh we want to thank you to please hang tight because we do expect to hear from attorney general Jeff Sessions in just a moment\n[noise]\nYou all for being here over the past week more than a dozen suspicious packages have been sent to through the United States Postal service through a media outlets a Hollywood actor and at least seven high ranking current and former political leaders and the Democratic party", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "26"}
