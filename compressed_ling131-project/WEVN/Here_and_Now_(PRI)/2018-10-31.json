President Trump is the campaign trail again today hoping to talk immigration\nAfter visiting Pittsburgh yesterday to pay respects after the synagogue shooting Democrats across the country are making their final pitch to voters many focusing their message on health care\nYou know we're going to scan the political rise in in the next few minutes but we are going to start the checking on the race for governor in the state of Alaska it was a three way race until October nineteenth just weeks before election day governor the locker and independent said this at the Alaska federation of NATO\nActive today I Am suspending like him [noise] for the re election as governor\nAnd the time I maintain become clear\nWill Walker then through his support behind the Democratic candidate former U.S Senator Mark Begich who was trailing in the polls behind the Republican\nFormer state senator mark done levy and now that race has tightened political rights that Republicans insurance chance to pick up a governorship on Tuesday has suddenly turned into the weirdest least predictable campaign in the country and to catch him in as a state government and politics reporter at Katy oh and Alaska Public media\nHi Andrew Hi Robyn so if you're going to have a weird race let it be the weirdest and this sounds like it and just take us back a second because the sitting Governor Bill Walker is running mate who was his lieutenant governor ... stepped down a week before the governor made his announcement that he wouldn't be running\nAnd I'm a lot resigned over an inappropriate comment to an unnamed woman did that anything to do with why I'm Governor Walker's stepped down or was it simply because as he said he felt he couldn't win and if the if the way race and he wanted to throw his support behind the Democrat\nHe really stopped because of the ... issue both he and baggage all along have wanted one or the other they both of one of the other to drop out um they're pretty similar on the issues there are some differences on social issues but walkers really downplayed social issues as governor and he's really focused on\nEconomic and non social issues so in practical terms there wasn't a lot of difference between the two of them and they were pretty evenly splitting the non Republican vote\nYeah but then when mullah made that comment it seem to be um the time to make an exit look or just after Walker left the race in Alaska survey research full had done levy the Republican up only four points in higher so uh talk about how this race has changed\n[noise] yeah so a challenge for baggage is Walker's name is still on the ballot even though he suspended his campaign it happened after the withdrawal deadline and there isn't a lot of precedence for having an incumbent governor name on the ballot\nAnd then not campaigning so as you could imagine if you get five percent if he gets ten percent that's largely going to be votes coming out of\nMostly cloudy

is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL around explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also been vaping in the workplace\nOr you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military these two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the rivers and commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable\nI think that what the constitution revision commission did is it packed things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but so I wouldn't be popular\nThat's all Broward County is top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandate a State Department of veteran affairs mandate estate anti terrorism office and something Henry's not happy with force every county to have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda it's sandwiched in between motherhood now by\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom and some legal experts see it this time is different [noise] Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans\nThat men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nThis year every appointment was made by Republicans are Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not\n... was on this year's commission on a committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not play just plain logic so when we first started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped in\nWould have an access or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a snake I environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens\nI think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beans and my voting record would speak to that that for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission wanted to stop voter fatigue\nJust meet this short or an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state cheap purpose it needs to be comprehensible I saw the more you unfold some different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot\nThree other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay justice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they're voting on\nBut the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle justice body into had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where for here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThere an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other years\nOverall the total number of measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a senior trip protection signed by registered voters and in\nThose citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that than just gets refer to the legislature to make a decision about\nHave gone to the ballot for a final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there's a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have\nThe last say on them so what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections\nAnd voting [noise] yeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year ... other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id of campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThat process varies by state the number of signatures required is usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from ... a little over ...\nSupport for an HP ours live stream comes

that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on the ballot\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process as a conflict between\nCitizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as a sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed\nUm but there's always some exceptions that prove the rural and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process is used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decides he doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there all the page has blocked the implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiative you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface the response to twenty six the initiatives was in many cases to either repeal or a change of the initiatives if possible in some states allow that some don't\nOr to pass restrictions on the process and then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty eight team with an issue proponents instead of letting it go to the ballot and letting it'd be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where\n... initial prominence withdraw and the policies still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that they should probably want it\nWhat is the thought about how useful a ballot questions are\nDirect democracy is is really important in the u._s. um every state but

twenty sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations mothers office has referred to the FBI that women were offered money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him\nAnd be our national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird though what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so ah there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR from someone who calls herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller\nAnd what may be the cases that woman actually does not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report on it\nOr is it possible that these living because I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that need it was too that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here has special counsel's office that it it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI and\nWell there are two conservative media personalities capable and yet Berkman who I had to be linked to the story to tell us about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by presidents\nWhat they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call\nThe crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office and Miller himself\nAnd that is the background for these accusations or a legit accusations this week involving\nPutative misconduct by Mahler um they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gateway pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report that was linked to a so called\nA intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified ah because no one knows which things in it a true and which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors or models not real human\nBeings okay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so our ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these women just say something about ... I think what ... what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap to try to get reporters to talk about them none of that is clear\nHowever we do know the special counsel's office has has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it does and there are criminal charges or there is some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\nIn ... in other words if somebody was masking a masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about Miller and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you\nWell know email earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end the temporary protected status TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua that ruling men that an estimated three hundred thousand immigrants didn't have to have\nAn immediate threat of deportation but many of them had lives are already turned upside down during the ... plus months when they believed they'd have to leave the United states he\n... is one example of that she's a TPS holder from Sudan it say recently war torn country but she left for other reasons of fears of her personal safety and until a few weeks ago was prepared to lose her temporary protected status on November second which had been the deadline\nShe joins us in the studio welcome thank you for having me and how long have you lived in the U.

president two years into their terms the other party does well I I think there is no reason to believe that history is not going to repeat itself\nThe question as to what level I Do think that the house majority is certainly in play I Would not be terribly shocked if the Democrats won the majority\nOn the other hand I Do think the Democrats are going to lose seats in the Senate and so it's going to result in a a sort of mixed I'm a control of government and what that's going to resolve this even more gridlock that we than we've ever seen in recent history and I think we're going to see\nThe house particularly decide that their real goal in life has to be a thorn in the side of the president\nReally didn't take a look at some of the Senate races you mentioned um John ... said you know anything could happen in point we've seen in the last two weeks he can you know two weeks ago we were seeing the Republican rebound after the Kavanaugh hearings than in the last week we've seen a

they got an ss said facts could be fluent it was the impact of this story that mattered he's\nFact checker Jim single took a binary approach something was a factor or wasn't and facts worst sacred soon single produce Ninety pages at an accuracy which the two turned into a book with email exchange just like the following limited by our colleagues\nSingle questions John and the time John said it took for the poor young jumper to hit the ground John the guy that said it was nine seconds but the car and said it was eight\nYeah I ... that it doesn't seem like it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them in the fall for nine seconds rather than eight in order to help make some of the leaders themes in the essay work John changing details about stuff like that\nThing but it seems a tad unethical to fiddle with details that really directly to the kids' death I don't\nThink it's unethical particularly because I wasn't alone in assuming his fault took nine seconds for a while as parents also assume that he had fallen for nine seconds\nBut now you do no better so should change\nNine is to integral part of the usa at this point and I admit that I'm wrong about nine later on anyway so the answer is not\nChanging it would ruin the say it would ruin it to make it more accurate yep\nWell now those emails have been turned into the Broadway play lifespan of a fact with powerhouse actors body kind of al as writer John D'Agata Harry Potter I mean Daniel Radcliffe as fact checker Jim single and cherry Jones as an editor referee the to\nThe seven years of fact finding has been condensed into twenty four hours in which the three are trapped in an apartment like caged cougars battling sometimes physically over the meaning of fact as a deadline looms which side will win will editor cherry Jones publish it you know find out [noise]\n\nWe met up backstage with all three before recent matinee as veterans of the stage can you feel what we felt in the audience last night people on the edge of this heat it's like I don't want to try to outdo the critics here with describing this but I came up with a pistol Larry ...\nYeah thank you it feels like we're at almost a fight or a or a debate\nYeah I mean first of all I have to have I just have to take a moment and just really acknowledge the I just was referred to as a veteran actor in the company of easy for the first time ... and yeah I mean I I've never done a play before but I have an argument that the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is really special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating it is a moment and some of gyms ... like make the audience go oh this guy's name ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous until I find like as far as you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nDo you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear that he kept going yeah well I did when when you would make a point did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good player you know the events of the players have to be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor\nWell it's funny because Jim single engine to God who we've been seeing a lot of cars they come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I hurt people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty literally thirty of his relatives who've flown in from\nAll over the country and and I when I opened the books at which they came they gave us for opening night Jim's comment was man we could've used you [laughter]\nYou your character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's a ... she's the soul of the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and Dana dammit [laughter] every night as I come down to the moment if the play where decision has to be made\nYou and your character have not made up their mind\nUntil the moment I reach for the phone how it's who convinces me\nOn that is awesome you if you publish Eleanor every night and the other guy that's got to be talking about post show debriefing\nWrote in my book thanks for having John's back\nOh I can talk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are three one strip clubs that thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or\nNews difference between it as a piece of writing in the newspaper\nIs really different to be the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play oh yeah\nThere is a difference in an ... an artistic peace being written in an effort you know what would you say about the Greek histories what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four 'cause you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously to set your character is not a bad guy we're in real life or\nHome about going anywhere he's just he's a writer economically\nBut in real life he he has said that the real writer who said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some\nPeople just destroyed her and they continue to do so um\nBut I don't think it's fair joined does it work for the Washington Post was not writing articles for writing articles for New York times he's ... he's a looming eating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that falls in a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just put all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line and most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions\nAnd there's a whole world effects to choose from the wrong stocks getting the way of the story\nAnd your test us as the wrong side what does that mean exactly\nWhat you got to be aware that we have a presidential spokes person Kellyanne Conway who spoke of alternative facts are not very\nInteresting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and frequently gets applause\nThe argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in it the whole thing can for the call for you and your trust a new relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debate about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments of the audience is kind of going like oh come on clearly you are going to follow this you know the difference the masses you know Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it drew a you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating certain point Jim single does start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense you'd\nDo both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are in the middle talk about the physicality on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance let's look at it\nAnd they was strangling each yes has already know winning that fight us strongly Daniel okay\nYeah it does go to those extremes because these two men care so much and it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I just can't believe we're talking about our country that way\nThen you'll you'll actually get a taste of this she went to the New Yorker and you were a fact checker for a day

tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is direct\nConference of state legislatures high ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they're Ninety nine is because one state the brass guy does not have bought the house and Senate they only have one a chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why are Republicans so dominant at the St level\nWell well what the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've earned candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms hum and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd an four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that I'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing issues around a abortion and and certainly on\nTaxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care at a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level\nAnd so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct in in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines\nIn most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had a very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty cents is right around the corner and this is kind of the first election that tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eight to the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled and less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as\nThirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policy making in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one\nBut I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind at their backs\nUm for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country\nAnd there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is\n... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party in the White House loses seats in state legislatures in twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years um they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're putting into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting\nHard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\nUh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote for either a Democrat or Republican\nOr in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for or did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment\nI'm very few people know who their state legislature who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house um so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important\nNot just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do\nAnd um and then to your point it then it does sort of turned into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race or that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake well\nThere there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special election and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's also learned about\nSo um [noise] you know this one race which has had seen close to ... million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had so in this cycle\nThey have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see in congressional races you know see\nFairly commonly pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they just increased fairly substantially from where they were just a few years ago there now paying a lot more attention to the state races but both parties are going all in on these races\nYou said President Obama said ... I remember President George W. Bush called the law says that he faced a thumping I think maybe it's now or something that the president has to do is come up with the word or for that first midterm election if it doesn't go out for their part", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Keene", "day": "31"}
