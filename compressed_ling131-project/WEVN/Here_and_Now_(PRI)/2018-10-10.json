shooter where they have at least\nTwenty victims of the shooter in an area that that\nWas December second twenty Fifteen the terror attack would claim fourteen lives and injured twenty two including Julie pious who was shot twice after her co worker opened fire during an office Christmas Party\nSix months later we met pious at her home where she showed us some of the Mentos she received during her recovery including a star of hope from one of her nurses\n[noise] see the things that get me to death and nice people so he runs marathons Everytime he runs marathons he saved them from people across [noise] so [noise]\nThey can gradually seasons lady or 'cause I got an award is a day for anyway [noise]\nAnd God Bless keep running\nWe've been following her recovery ever since pie as recently left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona to start over Julie pie as joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed a fresh a fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago\nYeah it was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my ah medical retirement so I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere\nAnd I'm just quieter comedy life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign um from my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am I'm responsible for all my medical care from here on wow and how how is that working out financially [noise]\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay or some of my co workers who have had to do the same thing\nUm you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher since we talked last I've had I think five surgeries and set in hospitals\nEach hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment and oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes the wind out of sales\nSo I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression\nIf they want to to sweep us away we were [noise] you know we were staying on the county um even for the\nSecond anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know\nEleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing ...\n[noise] now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy\nSo we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and uh\nSpending time with my family and walking my dog and exploring the Flagstaff northern Arizona area\nHow're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start from our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout United ... so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us had such a different perspective in that room\nI'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also\nHe was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from a supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room\nSo each person sort of has their own niche of of what they experienced and what was running through their mind and how law enforcement and really how they can improve their responses for the victims side\nAll they solve with law enforcement they're boots and in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\nUh I recently met a um teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during that shooting\nAnd after I found that out about him I didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Detroit thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through what are those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice I think they expect to see someone ...\nMuch more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking\nKind of to normal to them is it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story to become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke of us have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from happening\nNow I I it's so frustrating to me and\nIt just always seems that at the ease of obtaining weapons here\nBut especially these weapons like the air fifteens and these weapons that are made to hunt human beings really that's what they're made for they're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting\nEastern made for hunting humans\nAnd it's frustrating to me that there are so readily available in this country because it seems that all the shootings these mass shootings have involved that type of weapon\nAnd do you think that anything will be done about that\nI don't think anything's going to be done anytime soon unfortunately now\nTo drive innovation in the state and beyond law dot UNH dot edu by sea coaster mythology specializing

Scott hey Jeremy and with me in the studio at Cape BCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent\nFor Cape PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento or the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agree that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls just Cox have a chance well it's tough\nThe math is tough for him of the last time a republic\nYet two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when he has to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and new indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues a nuisance support sanctuary cities for example he backs California coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has\nAnd one of those areas as early childhood and during the recession state funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those funds have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as well\nAs you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump but the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nYou know I think the government is doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property in California the taxes are way way out of whack and [noise]\nBefore there was such a move pretty says that if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are pouring through in California that do it\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes\nThan Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters so uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem and these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he was not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and these congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races and you know there are just issues and affordability that I think a lot of these a new party preference voters\nAt which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters\nSenator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh hearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some that said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ... ah maybe\n[laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary uh you know I think\nKevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nOr and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly a it's a it's not entirely clear how this cabinet things playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was re spending Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know it's I haven't seen\nBroadwell but one thing one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kevin hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old he's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us\nAbout the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is the first time especially for younger voters here in California on daily and arguments are certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we were you bind or rewind back there twenty sixteen\nBernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California and many of them are young people getting engaged in politics for the first time some of those folks are resonating more out and looking for a change in the Senate race\nBut as Scott mentioned at the polling indicates you know strong favorability for Feinstein ... watching this ahead she seems to have a pretty substantial question right now but we're still you know little little over a little less than a month away\nRight and Scott there's one thing we haven't talked about that has come up in our conversations here in Southern California which is that there is a measure on the ballot to repeal a gas tax that may actually play a role in getting people out to the polls well that's what Republicans\nWere hoping Jeremy they put prop six on the ballot in fact John Cox the Republican candidate for governor really funded that drive to collect the signatures put it on the ballot polling shows it's not as popular as you might expect a because you know everyone pays the gas tax if you drive\nW abs Nashua eighty eight point during W.

I'm Jeremy hops and I'm Peter O'Dowd this is here and now and we are tracking hurricane Michael now a massive category ... storm that will slam this afternoon into Florida's Gulf Coast\nMichael will be the strongest recorded storm ever to make landfall on the Florida Panhandle and in the historic town of St Mark's a mandatory evacuation order is in effect\nBut resident Bernard Sessions is staying\nWell when they said it was a category four I never been in war but a donor last night her son coming in and say this category for and I said I Want to leave go ahead\nI'm going to die you know you don't stay on and they'll say\nAll right NPR's Greg Allen joins us now from Tallahassee Hi Greg\nHi Peter and I know you're just back from St Mark's right there on the coast or where we heard Bernard sessions what are conditions like they're\nWell you know when we're there is a of of hour or two ago and it was already seeing flooding uh this is before\nThe storm had had actually you know come close to shore was pushing water ahead of it you know nearly everyone had left town but the as Bernard sessions said he was a there with his friend Katrina Hurley\nHe has a shop in a garage there at the marina he's not staying there he's out of this house a little bit further out inland but it's a they tried to get into a back when he wouldn't\nBut he said he his shop in rain floods even in heavy rains ... expecting the worst but he's going to you know stick it out with his food supplies in his generator\nNow when you talk to him and other people in that area do you think do they get the sense really uh how intense this storm is going to be [noise]\nOh I think so I mean you know people make their own judgments about this about whether they're going to evacuate or not but I don't think too many people at this point can can claim ignorance about what a category ... storm means\nYou know if you're not right at the coast that they were they really worry about here's a storm surge which is going to be nine to fourteen feet in some places and I think people who live\nClose up to the shore that that is going to be a concern are mostly gone you know\nI think it was the rare person that would stay in that situation um ... what's going to have you're going to see this extensive flooding in coastal areas all along the panhandle I'm also you've got these high winds are concentrated around I wall that's going to be like almost like a tornado coming through\nAbout four or five miles where region so that's that's what people are worried about here if you're not in that manner I wall area you know and but on that one and there's no way to know unless it comes to shore where you are so people that's where people are taking a risk if they stay\nIn an area that has a mandatory evacuation you don't know where it's really going to come ashore and how strong the winds are going to be you know and and they're talking about tropical storm force winds a hundred and Seventy five miles from the center that will be a threat not just to that area but for the salaries were more likely to see you know widespread power outage\nAnd I was just going to ask you about that they're likely to be a lot of power outages have those started yet\nYes we're getting reports I think it's a ... up to thirty thousand state wide a lot of them are concentrated along the path panhandle coastal area where the storm is just preparing to come ashore you know it's just just miles offshore now and the area around Mexico beach by Panama City Florida and so that's where the power outages\nBy UNH is MBA programs fulltime online and part time in ... information session October seventeenth details that application that MBA dot UNH dot edu\nI tasted Indian summer today sunshine temperatures near eighty drizzle and showers on the way tonight in a very rainy Thursday weights us\nThis is an age PR\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

C. A. actually worked pretty well in California because we've got a huge population\nBut there and again we were seeing providers drop out of the market so there's a lot of things to be worked on health care\nWhat about what we just saw with Brett Kavanaugh how do you feel about how the Senate handled his confirmation\nI thought it was hard core politics I didn't like it it should have all been vetted free hearing the United states the people of this country should not have been dragged into that I don't think it did anything tonight is it's created a lot of chaos and dysfunction\nOne of the things that some voters know about you here in orange county is that your husband was caught up in a pond [noise]\nWhat do you want people to know about that and and do you think that they should be judging you on that at all [noise]\nNumber one that's a lie there was no Ponzi schemes so I Want to set the record clear\nThere were allegations in the litigation from two thousand nine that declared everything it was simple it was never a criminal litigation that was a civil litigation where you can throw anything against the wall and tried to make it to you\nAnd I went to a jury trial so I really do believe that it's been misrepresented than politicians when they have no record to run on frequently liked to dig up old old filing this was a huge litigation but I was cleared in two thousand Thirteen do you think that that's hurting you know in this race\nWell if you can't defend yourself and does but I got the ... people actually you know are are asking about it now and I'm explaining it it's on my website\nWhat happened it was just sounds\nAnybody involved in real estate understand the problems in two thousand eight the bank folded a\nProperty it was it was miserable and Mr Leavenworth for countrywide and he said there was an excuse for for closing on tape but he was in New brand new attorney and the crew and and they get the brand new guys these kind of dirty job to do\nWhat do you think the biggest issue is for voters in his district this year I think the dysfunction in DC [noise]\nYou know the this started than teach meant hearing and all of this chaos going on if they don't want politics they weren't results [noise]\nDiane Harkey Republican running for Congress here thank you so much thank you [noise]\nParties opponent is the guy she was just talking about a lawyer and first time candidate Mike Lebanon we met him at his campaign office in San Clemente and I asked him why he's running\nWell for the last two decades I've been involved in a variety of political campaigns I've never felt compelled to run before myself\nA after having been very involved in a twenty sixteen election or to help Secretary Clinton\nOr in after seeing that result my wife and I both decided what good is our background or experience or education or relationships the values that we have the values that we want to share with our own children or if we don't stand up and try to do something for our country right now\nHow much of an uphill climb as it for you as a Democrat running in orange county and part of San Diego county\nWell the good news is that in the primary on June fifth fifty one and a half percent of the vote went to the Democratic candidates so the momentum is on our side a President Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent uh people are ready for new leadership do you want to see President Trump impeached\nI'm not running on an impeachment platform I Do want to get to the truth I Want to see justice and ultimately I Want to see a a a an investigation by Mr Mahler uh that uh is not politicized\nOr what we have seen with Devin Nunes has as chair of the house intelligence committee is the withholding\nOf relevant testimony and information in you know the other side\nYou know they're they're making us to be a beep beep some are angry mob or they're saying you know don't give matches due to an arsonist couldn't be further from the truth we care about our country we care about the rule of law there cannot be one set of rules for the president added states one set of rules for everyone else that's not how\nOur founders so you know created this a democratic\nRepublic that we live in our constitution still matters\nYou bring up the line about the angry mob how much do you think that what just happened with Brett Kavanaugh has changed the dynamics of your race has it energized Republicans more energized Democrats more than they were before\n[noise] well I have no idea all I Know is that um you know yesterday day before we have an extraordinary number of volunteers more than we'd ever seen\nA and I don't know how much of that was related to a now justice cabinet or not but what I can tell you is that uh we're doing everything we can to take nothing for granted over the last month of this campaign we are going to just do an incredible amount of work and I won't predict anything other than that we will out works the other side\nWe asked your opponent Diane Harkey about ah something that's been dragging her campaign which is that her husband had to pay a penalty for being involved in a Ponzi scheme she said that's a lie\nWhat do you think uh I think the victims deserve to be heard and the facts are very simple ah her husband a endpoint center financial was found by both the uh jury as well as a a judge and\nTo be financial fraud and dozens of seniors were defrauded out of millions and millions of dollars and her husband her ex husband or they have not paid nearly enough to those victims\nShe also ah in her answer to our question about that tried to connect you to country wide I which was responsible for a lot of foreclosures I've seen that on your website you say I was just a junior lawyer working for bank of America which you own country wide and I'd have to to do with that\nBy listened community services offering programs for those in need

fastest growing ethnic group in this state\nThe population a slice of the pie that has tripled in size since Nineteen eighty and in orange county were there for congressional races that the cook Political Report labels competitive\nIt's about eight hundred thousand of right now we are over twenty percent of the county and third largest Asian American population in the nation\nMarion food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI say it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent and the community and foreign born ... cording to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rise in second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim his principal in CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrats James Honda former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican\nAnd my second generation friends\nAre more on the Democratic side why is that\nMaybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion\nA butt up at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans of Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma war types of financial distress\nThe first generation tend to say why the Republicans\nBecause they see the the corruption of government the distrust of government and why the second generation\nI think because of the American values the\nA lot of these Korean Americans I grew up in ... uh tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the process or in urban areas into\nFocus more progressive thinking than more the conservative the suburban ideal\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nIn the thought of eliminating because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so and the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from that chain migration\nSo it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally\nOf a majority of them and they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country will definitely be the my\nFriends I mean more democratic or\nLiberal Republicans are progressive Republican myself\nHave have definitely some qualms about that key issue\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like Tam and sunny new and we met them at a cafe sunny owns it in orange county neighborhood called little Saigon\nSunny told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I I think and you know you look at generation one which is our parents and and I we we're all one point fight and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in Vietnam\nBut we were raised in America so we understand what it means to be in ...\nParents where they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it's a stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just sort of a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from\nA country where you can't really trust the government so stay away from us so we came over here you see a lot of all this family cash only pay you know what you don't want to say what we have our own strategies and we don't want to\nShare best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why for generations they're known 'em to be very fragmented right and you don't want to collaborate but we grew up in\nAmerica and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew and [noise] you know being an American\nOr you know and having it includes city I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown that because we do collaborate\nAnd we're showing 'em or first gentle parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing a best practice we actually sharing best practices entrepreneur and they're getting better but because we're doing that we're able to work together and that's one of the big differences\nFrom generation one\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county is fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nWhen my family came to this country we came legally and that because we wanted handout that because we wanted the opportunity America provided to succeed on our own\nYoung ... praised by the ... the register ... consistent record opposing tax increases in Boise for fiscal responsibility young Kim for\nCongress there hasn't been a Korean American in Congress since Nineteen Ninety nine this year three are running in November says political consultant Alex can\nWe have young Kim of course local year with Pearl Kim and also I'm Andy Kim and may not related\nNot related but all you do Kim is a very popular name current\nAmericans and a quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican and helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this connection this this uh ethnic connection and having\nNot a single Korean American in Congress right now I'd rather it doesn't matter if the Democrat Republican I Would like to see a Korean American on there to represent me\nWe heard something similar from Vietnamese American Tam knew when\nYou don't see myself especially as a business owner of the community as a Vietnamese American first before being part of the party as a Republican or Democrat\nThat sentiment says Mary and food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace in education and housing\nAsian American no matter how long they've been here they get the question of you know where you really from our where are you from I'm fourth generation my family's been here since Nineteen sixty one and I still get in or things like your English is so good and\nAnd you know where you really really from what languages you speak and I have to really explain only speak English or Spanish and and and you know my family's been here for so long that it it's those types of questions we always get it and so it makes people feel\nThat aren't they're not really American [noise] so what do you think that means for this upcoming election [noise]\nI think it's really important to show as Asian Americans how crucial we are to civic engagement and how important it is for us to vote and have a voice\nBut also how important it is to educate the general public about the issues that we find are of concern that we feel are important and so to really talk about our values [noise]\nAll of that is to say the politicians from both parties have a lot\nTo gain from these Asian American communities in orange county or politicians paying attention to Asian American voters do you think [noise]\nI think they have to and so I think those who haven't in the past are now and I think many of the ones who are more savvy or have known how important the Asian American vote is\nAnd how and why we we tend to vote as a flock and so I think they see the impact that can be made by really learning about the issues have concern", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "10"}
