G\nThere are reports that Saudi Arabia is getting ready to acknowledge that ... died during a botched interrogation at the Saturday consulate in Istanbul, Turkey for the latest let's bring in ... she at MSNBC anchor an economics correspondent and co host of ... in rural highly ... and what more do we know about this new Saturday explanation for what happened\nWell we we know it hasn't fully hasn't come out yet are there are a lot of reports that it's being crafted what's interesting about this is that it echoes something that a President Trump said yesterday morning after each\nMohammed bin Salman his son effectively runs Saudi Arabia\nOr and you know yesterday the president talked about a a rogue group of people maybe having a kill Jamal ... ah and then that's what the Saudis are floating at the issue here is that the Saudis are looking to accept responsibility in some fashion for this so that the story can move on at the moment they they're facing\nThe threat of sanction and a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're trying to\nUh work their way out of it but no explanation officially and\nWhen you say the explanation was being crafted ... does that imply that my ... the secretary of state is helping the Saudis craft the explanation for what happened well\nIt's unusual that before an explanation comes out my Mike Pompeo is there or if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my palm pay was explained to the Saudis that this is a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered\nA that say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses the president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the sort of Saudis need to do something so that the next step can take place what\nHas all this done to the U.S relationship with both Saudi Arabia and with turkey where are the the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia or not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nA because Saudi Arabia has such largest but Turkey's a more industrialized country it's more western facing it's a NATO member turkey as you know handed over pastor Andrew Brunson who had been jailed for some time so it does seem that turkey in sort of throwing Saudi Arabia under the bus for this\nAlleged murder and then releasing this pastor is trying to go up a few notches\nIn terms of its relationship with America a Saudi Arabia has a very very strong very long a business financial diplomatic arms and energy relationship with the United states and this is the first time in the history of those two countries are at least since Nineteen Seventy three since the ... oil embargo that it's been this fraught what\nNow available to New Hampshire state liquor stores ... sunny and windy this afternoon high temperatures upper forties to mid fifties Italy partly cloudy tonight with low temperatures in the mid to upper thirties\nTomorrow partly sunny for most of the state mostly cloudy a chance of showers north of the lakes region is tomorrow upper forties to mid fifties this is an HP are\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

throwing shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents\nPete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now thanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's [laughter]\nIt's just something that as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen it became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate what is happening is not normal\nAnd I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary\nAnd how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January\nTwenty first there twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter]\nAnd I guess it was a double meaning and my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post someone or said that I was throwing shade on the new\nOr the new president\nYou didn't even know what that term it\nI didn't even know what that term that after you know I started to pose some more and then I heard that the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen\nThe biggest credit history was really on January twenty two thousand nine huge in all caps with a picture\nOf the national mall with a lot of people on it\nI mean I kind of picture says it All right right\nIn that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true\nYes do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's very rarely is there\nWhat's interesting to me is if I'm if there is a my grand followers are have my back and they they ended up commenting back to the sea and they often pointed out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know if they're rushing bots but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in my Instagram feed just and saying what they want to say\nA in this book or you've got I'm often either Trump tweets a alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post there's one\nI'm looking at right here a President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is that staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote\nStuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest\nI mean just say you're staying at bed Bedminster because you want to play golf and but ... just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me so that was sort of just a you know tongue in cheek right hulk poke I guess what's the one\nThat you're most proud of\nThat you're like I Can't believe I thought of that [noise]\nAh the the [laughter] I have to correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\n... you know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points and all caps a ... in regards to the FBI and investigation\nUm [laughter] and I and I found a a picture of a a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party and I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that he has more of an operation and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history\nFox News ... every other networking you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty times to the union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had the kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama as it was a two thousand ten state of the union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] but especially you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over it was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff and [laughter] and I posted a picture of President Obama with a gun right and I said there's only one\nRocket man [laughter] what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing\nSupport for an HP arts live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustain excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you online at or dash Reno dot com\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nDo you have ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post amongst around\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public honoring the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use then there's another guy that has a\nHas a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you or do you wanna do something else [noise]\nNo I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for\nWhat kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come [noise]\nUm because I\nDon't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a\nPerson to a photograph every day\nUm someone that I had you know admired someone who gave me incredible access\nAnd I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could\nAnd and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never something that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened\nUh because I took a right turn and instead of a left turn\n'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nTeaches at one more question for you um you know everybody now takes pictures with their phone\nYou can tell when you look at a Pete Souza photograph that it's really great photograph compared to what most of us are able to do although some people are great amateur photographers what is your one piece of advice that you give to people about how to take a better picture\nEarly skin cancer detection saves

experiment of grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents are the minority students objected captain is director of the little red schoolhouse tell us first what was your thinking and trying this\nUh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help their academic achievement well\nYou said that a part of this was based on a you know research this wasn't the intent to isolate the minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know that special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their\nClassrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms in it for a part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this and the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and cultural identity oh what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some\nEasy and it as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing that being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development and of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it\nIn the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for middle school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of a few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experienced they're having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects the minority students negatively it at home all the place where it's it's much of a you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher and the student isn't that a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both of those in even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nAnd this is an unheard of in twenty eleven a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had its junior class divide itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were getting for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated hung on that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I have to do things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice but it's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with ... both white teachers and teachers of color\nHaving a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from\nYou know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school that look what happened parents objected to have you dropped the policy or decided not to expand it what's going on\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what ... what a lot of independence schools do which is to have race be one of the\nComponents of his students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni to continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full ... guy\nBy the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan [noise] uh where you had to end is this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remains somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so a lot of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's full of cats and director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan so thanks so much it's been a pleasure\nTomorrow we'll speak with an African American educator who says there are times to group kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise]\nOkay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the final is in the annual comedy wildlife photography awards tiger Freetown sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose\nWhat is a very good question I Choose personally the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I didn't have to think about why I just that's how I Do my every ... it was like\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can will also have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture of a school [laughter] hands are held out his mouth is wide open as if he's saying [laughter] it's called caught in the act or from photographer Mary ... a gallon I mean that's laugh out loud\nIs allowed and definitely one of my favorite\nI think it's virtually impossible just to see the animal and the ...

Daphne started thanks to the nonprofit forbidden story which continues the work of murder journalists and last week five members of the European Parliament calls the European Commission to back an investigation into college his murder\nCiting revelations from the forbidden stories work including that the model T's governments sale of Maltese passports to wealthy Russians for one million euros\nWas enabling those Russians to enter a European Union countries and carry out money laundering and other crimes and aren't we shot is founder and executive director of forbidden stories\nLow rent a year and other reporters picked up quite a few of the threads that Daphne Caroline tackle each year was pulling on tell us more\nWhere we were thanks to the work of a forty five reporters for the past six months we were able to\nReveal some um information regarding the high level of corruption inside the party's highland and we were reading some consulting Fox about some potential links between the economy minister and some of the people who have been arrested because they were triggering the boom there were literally pushing the button\nPushing the button yeah they were using the cell phone that was connected to the bone under the calls for definitely don't want to get a job today\nOr she is she has been killed at least they're suspected of doing that and they were arrested\nAnd so during that investigation with the world cup that I'm collaborative team we were able to meet some people who told us that they have seen the economy minister with\nThose two suspects before the murder and to the ... the ... project was not only a ball to identify who might be the key those but it's up to complete the stories of Daphne\n... very critical work because her stories was about sensitive issue like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to take the destiny of the name of that politic what's a definite project\nAgain you hear the multi government she was doing an investigation into possible corruption having to do with matters of the economy and here you have you found the economic minister connecting with some of the suspects in her death that's quite something look I I just want to back up and and talk about how this started because it's in a compelling story\nYou worked in a news agency across the hall\nFrom the Charlie Hebdo office tell us tell us about your experience there\nOn investigative reporter for the past Twenty years and uh I used to travel a lot and to do some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press but to another think convinced me personally a personal events in my in my life convinced me to start forbidden to reason this up and\nActually twenty Fifteen when ... of al Qaida in Yemen arrive in the streets where the offices of the company where I was working for world in Paris\nAnd they into the building and they killed ... newsroom who were sharing the same flaw that were the right to the door right next to her and these day address arrived to the two minutes after the terrorist escaped the building\nAnd I into the newsroom and then I I was uh the first to discover my friends and ... just dying go just already dead\nAnd we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so this is really to really change my life because this was happening in Paris this was not happening on a conflict zone us let's new rocket twice in the middle of Paris twice in my personal environment\nHe was about ... new and we were doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ...\nThey were able to ... and so it was really traumatic experience I took a lot of time to recover of calls for that\nAnd trying to forget some very difficult futures but on that day I decided\nWhat I can do as a journalist to continue the work of murder the reporters to keep stories alive and usually when a journalist who's dying for wants to raise that probably means that the story is very relevant to the public opinion it's very important to continue to keep this there was a life\nAs he said something so compelling they're usually when a journalist get killed there on to something and so for you it's about figuring out what that was it as you say sending a message out to the murderers you can kill the messenger but you won't kill\nThe message the story look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona reporter John ... was killed in Nineteen Seventy six\nA new organization sprung up it was called the investigative reporters and editors and they set out to finish his work but there have been over sixty journalists killed this year many of their debts connected to their work we also here in the United states in Annapolis a newspaper or was attacked in so many killed\nThreats were made against the Boston Globe by California man he threatened to kill all of them do you do you despair I mean it doesn't feel as if you know the message is getting out\nYeah well um [noise] we are really facing a lot of threats not totally\nInsults Americana Tony in Mexico in Europe too\nIn a an old continents and I think that the the only response which is very efficient it's a global an collaborative response collaboration brings protection if you are working to get the if\nThe Cuba will see that there was a group of journalists ready to complete investigation and to expose the crimes event that will probably think twice the next time they would think about killing one report or\nYou were talking about the origins project that's great and very inspiring project and I do think that we have to react this way\nWe have to send this pool full signal to the enemies of the press to kill the messenger you would never kill the message because we are\nHere to make sure people to get access to this is very important stories so\nYes there was a lot of work we need some support there were a lot of children is to have been killed there are a lot of many forbidden stories beyond that that we need to publish\nIt's quite children to do that and a journalist who is dying is just it is not just to a number we took ... important stories important information got some people want to to hide some people wanted to silence\nWell and there are other groups I met I mentioned investigative reporters and editors there's also the group organized crime corruption reporting project that pursuit another investigation twenty Fifteen when a of an investigative journalist with locked up in Azerbaijan\nAs there is a Brazilian nonprofit organization I think it's a ... a B. R. A. J. our eyes they continue the work of another reporter so\nThis has been going on this as you say collaborative so that it's the investigative work is spread out among many reporters that brings us to the Saudi journalist who wrote for among other papers the Washington Post\n... um us and Turkish officials believe that he was murdered inside the Saudi conflict in Turkey\nHave you been already eyeing his work\nWell of course I'm this is the kind of case that we we should be interested in what the story use he was publishing he was walking along and we need to to know mobile the Saudi regime and we need to to expose that\nWe get more information to build the disappearance of a of the ... and the hope that we'd be able to get some information so the rug is very difficult country to rock and\nSo he was a kind of voice very rare unique so we we we ... we need that kind of ... and so we need to work to get those went to look at what kind of stories he was publishing those pastures\nAnd one last night I'm Wondering you said when you came upon your colleagues largely a cartoon is a satirical cartoonist Kelly who's in murder or were dying\nYou said that you you said you could not get those images out of your head has the work that you're doing now has that he's that at all\nThat's a very good question I'm I'm not doing that for being able to forget those kinds of different kinds of pitchers um but it's really helpful because I think that's I wanted to do some saying as a journalist", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Keene", "day": "16"}
