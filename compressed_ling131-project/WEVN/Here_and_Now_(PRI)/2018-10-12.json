or as a writer and the guardian put it after reading Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep\nNot sleeping has been making me stupid or fat or unhappy airport sicker worse that sex as well as more likely to get cancer Alzheimer's and die in a car crash\nAnd yet many of us just can't sleep even knowing that\nAnd students topped the list as homework sports clubs bravado many get just a few hours a night will now some schools are taking action Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiatives he\nAlso teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the successor that class\nHarvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be expanded to upper class and his well ... is with us in Studio welcome\nThank you very much he was just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took this online course before coming in why what would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this online course to all the students\nWhile they were a pleased by first of all the response more than Ninety percent of the students are took the course on students were actually lining up to fill out the questionnaire about their positive responses to the ...\nProgram well what are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but stand that in some schools now including Harvard some of the group study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah uh and this of course one of those popular courses or a computer science courts that that has actually ... where\nThe students are scheduled to work all night as part of the course and then they have there are other responsibilities I mean the\nThe football team has been getting up at four\nThirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled in many different directions many times problem sets are do let's say they'd o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is just shut up for the students staying up all\nThe extend this to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have\nAs their social media that's keeping kids out\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets our circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so in kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock sends the strongest drive for waking just before what would be dusk I'm so during evolution a we couldn't see during the nighttime\nAnd the brains send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together\nAnd be in a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward\nJust by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside and when we decide to switch off so much\nWell this last week we talked about some of the health issues that arise disrupts sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWell I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes a nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and death well\nAny Matthew Walker he's book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he doesn't fake ad for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer and dementia\nIt ward off cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke not to mention diabetes are you interested of course it's sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you know ...\nI mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse dot coms\nAnd lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how do you can say this to students and it's part of the culture to see you know can stay up the latest\nPart of the programs are we caught sleep on on a very interactive program in which for example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner\nAnd not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on their sneakers and they find out that if\nThe tank up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team the shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more valiantly all free throws in one of the things that students don't realize is that it's not just the amount of sleep but consistency in the\nTiming of sleep apnea so students have irregular schedules they don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually the internal clock\nShifts you later so when we've studied Harvard students we found\nThat those who have irregular schedules even if they got this same duration of sleep at inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological\nThat they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\nWell so how do you change school life so that kids can sleep money maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group but when am I right\nSo when I had been teaching a freshman summer every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students and the seminar have to make its head like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven our interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity school sanctioned activity on the first a schedule activity in the morning\nOr another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you're working with talking to you most specifically that students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from bringing on Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters he took his probably twenty four percent less likely to report an injury used have as many disability days and you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll post some of the sit here now down to work\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shift\nThere's nothing you can do to help their sleep and we implemented a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour I mean one detail so we did a sleep disorders screening for example for ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires way identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea\nOr chronic insomnia or other disorders and we refer them to treatment turns out that one out of three men and one out of six women have sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep if he can't breathe and sleep at the same time\nYou're not going to get the rest that you need\nAnd when we first came to present to them they made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the session\nA or kidding everybody say oh I got to have my sleep session and so on\nBut then when we started showing them the information we feel that this is a it's a right for people to have this information to understand\nThat untreated sleep apnea for example after Eighteen years only fifty eight percent of them are still alive as opposed to Ninety four percent of their without sleep apnea because it increases the risk of cardiovascular death by four hundred and twenty percent and we've had\nAmazing feedback from people say oh my God this this change my whole life my depression was resolved I didn't stay on medications anymore my marriage I came back together it can really have a major impact\nAnd all we provide people as information and a screening\n\nTemperatures will be in the lower sixties this afternoon with

we reported that the Syrian Army backed by Russian and Iranian allies was poised to mount an offensive to take a blood back which is expected to be a bloodbath\nThat Russia and turkey struck a fragile deal to wait to establish a demilitarized zone around it live and give rebel and radical groups deadlines to leave so what happened BBC Middle East editor Jeremy ... is in London but just back from a reporting trip and it live on the regime side ... lines soldiers in foxhole is pretty remarkable\nAnd Jeremy at some of those deadlines for leading are right about now so what did you see are the rebels militants leading\nWell so far they seem to be respecting the whole thing um it's the twelve now and the final deadline is on the fifteenth submit a couple of days by the fifteenth\nThat meant to move both men and the heavy weapons out of the this new GM's either they've\nBeen put together by the Turks and the and the Russians so you know we'll see but it's up to now according to the ... of course have a stake in things going well [noise] uh up to now they appear to be moving\nAnd then what happens then if it if let's say it said a Syrian group that rose up you know against the Assad regime during the Arab Spring before radical groups came in from elsewhere and you know kind of fill the vacuum there if it's the Syrians what happens when they start leaning that area aren't they going to be targeted\nThe estimate is being used by the un is Ninety thousand men who carry guns are into an all of that Fifteen to twenty thousand a ... you might cold die\nWhat the DMZ does it basically postpones dealing with the issue\nWill meantime here you are in the front lines where did you see there including the troops that apparently didn't want to be seen\nOr with the troops that didn't want to be seeing what Russians somewhere okay we're talking but there were a tool good about being filmed all recorded in any way um the Russians very noticeable around the\nTerms of the physical state of the area you drive along and there was one wrecked vintage off to another wrecked religion mostly those places a ghost towns now\nLet's listen to a little of the sound that you gathered though because in these destroyed towns around the region a you found Abu Mohammed who'd been able to reopen his barber shop astonishingly associated with me\nI still had that we'd always hope for peace will leave much of the structure of the whole region are you pleased or pause for leaves a lot of victims than that [noise]\nSo you stumbled across him but from your reporting it seemed like you wander around wondering where did these people go they either have become refugees in these and mostly empty towns or had been killed\nWhile I wondered every time I saw yet another and to tell us all ... well what's happened to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from it looked at all and I think some will be dead and others will be inside at the city itself\nUp ... you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a\nShow old or did a deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up they offer them a way out whether they would be bus stop to it lip and that's where they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you\nDrive around that area as we did and we talked to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThat the war to in the hot out of the country and it has done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also [noise]\nThe way that it's um it's just destroyed the fabric of everything if you if if you're in the central Damascus it looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus do you go to places like the area rounded lip then you can really see what the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nWell so what do you think happens now because it's not just the Syrian diehard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamist militias along with them that have you know taken advantage of the situation there he had the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back courage and now we have Turkey's president airline\nThreatening to expand his country's military efforts in parts of northern Syria to take on these us that Kurdish fighters look people anticipate that the Syrian forces backed by Russia and Iran will take back it lived there will be the end of this sort of the civil war\nBut you've got you know U.S interests Iranian interest Russian interest at Turkish interests what do you anticipate happens now\nEssentially the dangers of all of that or is that some of these guys can stop bumping into each other and a bad way you saw it recently when the Israelis are shut down a Russian plane so Syria is not guaranteed peace once if you like the civil war part of the war and\nHe'd be the middle east editor Jeremy going from London after his trip to is within Syria Jeremy thank you thank you

let's check in with NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joe Hi thanks for having me\nI understand you're an emergency operations center just outside of Panama City what are you learning\nYes as you say I I'm just a couple of miles outside of Panama City here at the emergency operations center where\nFirst responders or sort of gathering from all across the region or the parking lot is in fact totally overflowing with vehicles feed a military coast guard utility companies you know it's spilling out into the neighboring into the sort of the swamp land and fines around the building\nI learned more though from my trip into Panama City I've just come back from you know going down into the stadium and really looking around at the damage and it's pretty staggering\nBut a lot of the pictures that we've seen so far been focusing on Mexico beach so is it is bad where you are in in Panama City because in some places it just seems like homes and businesses are just totally wiped off their foundations\nThe damage in Panama City is pretty extensive I mean I've never seen so many trees on the ground or bent over power lines on the ground all over the place I mean you drive around the city and and you're just constantly driving over them still there's lots of debris and the roadways\nYou know some houses are seem like they're more or less okay others look like they're okay except for they have a tree you know leaning on this on the roof\nAnd then there are other buildings where the wind just shared the whole face of the building off I mean I saw several churches that were just you know I'd really

Washington Post is reporting that turkey has audio and video proof that he was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi ...\nWrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the consulate more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia the BBC's mark low and joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting that's similar to the post what are you hearing\nYeah that'd be a source close to touch investigation is said turkey has goats documents that evidence to support the claim off state sponsored murder of Jamal ... she went into the Saudi consulates in Istanbul ten days ago\nUm this source that tells us that are on course official position is still that ... is missing about that a tax intelligence knows for sure that he was murdered\nI'm not a backstop the American news reports and all that audio and have a ... a video evidence the recordings showing that mistake a show she was a northern he\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that and they're very gruesome details coming out including a recordings allegedly of him being beaten\nI'm On some reports that his body was this men but\nI'm the Saudi or officials Saudi authorities are still slap lead to knowing all the allegation\nHow reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence um I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this is not strange communication strategy with this government here in techie where they don't really speak directly to\nForeign media for example they and they don't actually have a ... communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moment teachers that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach\nExcept for example turkey has welcomed in Saudi officials here\nTo be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation\nOr that the Saudis have proposed that is the tux playing nice and saying that we're going to we don't want to blow up on different relationship at this stage but they all lead King I'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and that forced tightening the screws on the Saudis and trying to get the ... western backing for the position\nThat question about that joint committee the Saudi Turkish investigation\nHas to be how credible it can be if it includes the Saudi Government yeah and and I think that it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint suddenly the crimes inquiry what the Russians I mean I I really think that they say is kind of\nUm a diplomatic nice city on the parts of the tax entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have got the evidence to back up their espresso allegation\nAnd there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case that a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists or are people noting that at all\nThe biggest jailer of journalists I mean yes it has been noted particularly by Chuck E. ... such as a spot and\nYou know that said at techies not treating journalist and the same way as they ... a journalist is alleged of injuries you know that it's not murder in K which took him out\nOr how tech is locked up journalists which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them and completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on liberal values but but uh yeah there is some distance do between the two cases I think here\nIn our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there and his stumble how much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region\nWell I think that turkey is very aware that it that you know the rejection of Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage bought a I think that you know clearly he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect a flagrant violation of its sovereignty ate it won't support from the U.S and from the west\nThe towards the Saudis and speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story I Want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson held in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government uh what are we learning about that\n[noise] yeah this is a country that produces more news than it can can see him ready and the American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in a massive punch off the failed coup here and twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless and they put pressure on the tax to release him president Edwin has always maintained he could not to interfere with the independence of the ... which is seen as laughable abide by critics of tacky and what's happened today is that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which basically a corresponds to the time already spent in custody Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S\nAnd and uh it was a source of massive friction between the U.S in ... governments at sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack his car and say\nThat as well and I expected to east to some extent\nAnd it will be seen most likely as a diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's more glowing in Istanbul thank you so much pressure not back to the U. S. where a candidate in Georgia's hotly contested governor's race has been hit with a federal lawsuit Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running for governor\nAnd he was sued yesterday by groups that say his office is jeopardizing the votes of some minority residents ... campaign denies that it did anything wrong but his opponent Democrat Stacey Abrams is calling on him to resign as secretary of state\nJonathan breeder is counsel with the Brennan Center for justice is Democracy Program at the nonpartisan group\nThat advocates for voting rights Jonathan thanks for joining us things around the reporting is that camps office stole the registrations for fifty three thousand mostly black and Hispanic voters based on a law known as exact match what can you tell us about that\nExact matches a policy by which if all the information on a voter registration form down to the digital ... doesn't match perfectly with existing data in driver's license for Social Security information the voter registration form is put on hold and in some cases rejected entirely\nDo most people on that list I Know that they've been excluded\nThey're supposed to get a notice in the mail but oftentimes people don't receive those are understanding what they need and sell the burden is and placed on the voter to fix this problem which in other states would not affect our eligibility or voting at all\nOkay so in total comes off as a secretary of state has canceled nearly a million and a half voter registration since two thousand and twelve\nHis campaign is saying that he's making sure that only legal citizens cast a ballot and that it has never been easier to vote in Georgia um what what do you make of that are you aware of any voter fraud problem in Georgia on a significant level\nThere's no significant evidence of voter fraud and Georgia and although voter lists maintenance is important there is no connection between aggressively purging the voter rolls the way Georgia has and making elections more secure at\nCamp is also a putting a fair amount of the blame here on Stacey Abrams his Democratic opponent she started a voter registration group in two thousand and Thirteen called the New Georgia project in campus making the point that in the process of signing\nThousands of people up through that project they did a sloppy job and that he was just pulling out those improper registrations I mean it does Stacey Abrams in her group deserve any blame for maybe doing this in in a poor fashion\nTo get certain communities who don't have as much access to government offices registered to vote if there is information missing or sometimes happen the states should do everything they can to resolve those discrepancies what Georgia is doing is\nMaking it the voters burden to resolve that problem instead of trying to fix it themselves\n[noise] do you think a candidate who's running for governor can independently also be the secretary of state\nWhile it's happened before and other states I don't think this is a unique situation I think that one of the concerns is that as secretary of state or Mr camp has made\nSome controversial statements there was a statement he made several years ago expressing dismay about some voter registration drives and he's been accused of politically motivated investigation so that's certainly a concern in Georgia specifically", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "12"}
