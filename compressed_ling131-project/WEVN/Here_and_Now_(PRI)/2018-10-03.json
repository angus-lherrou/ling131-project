unsolved art heist in history listen and apple pie guest\nAbout the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers they were having a good time she said at my expense my friends said when he heard that\nThat was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who move to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to catch treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left and my friends now well over sixty pretty strong decried if that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked forward they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying the national sexual assault hotline report it in the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls a seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline cause tripled and Brazil oh heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers\nShe joined us from Chicago and welcome thank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from the weeks prior\nFive times as many calls as two weeks ago the first day on friday or calls were a little more than double from the weeks prior\nAnd we're continuing to see an increase calling him right what are people saying we're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation\nHad a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that the testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that\nHe's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody had a flashback\nYou know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely so flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if they're right back in that moment they and they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety\nAnd it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and our nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone who can now do this and you can't breathe loves the Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed\n... people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIs the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when you experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically in one of\nThree ways we are going to fight we're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and what was the Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about as well from the survivors that we work with we usually\nPeople have a flashback she's also explained us that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presence ing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative", "year": "2018",
