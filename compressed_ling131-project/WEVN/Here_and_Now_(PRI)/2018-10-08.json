feminists according to lead to Hong Fincher feminism is having a moment in China and that is deeply frightening to the Chinese government\nVenture is author of the book betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China she says she hasn't seen as social movement this powerful since the Tiananmen Square protests of Nineteen eighty nine ... ...\n... thanks so much for having me here nice\nTo talk to you tell me first the focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us\nExamples of how among these five women are the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nRight so I'm In these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed and twenty Fifteen\nFor planning to celebrate International Women's day um and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handout stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses\nBut before they even carried out their plan\nThe police and and all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping round ever rats\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them\nFor thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what is it done well well um well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because the authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charging them with and and in the end it was something\nI can too disturbing that social order\n'em that they're the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people in the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you know handing out stickers or making T shirts\nHarassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film this fine\nUm well I mean among the feminists are quite a few of them um had suffered abuse and their personal lives well growing up um\nFor example the mites herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle um some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse\nAnd and it wasn't just these five women a lot of the women who um who have been involved in the women's rights movement has personally being um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence\nAnd that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back one\nOf the of some of his five a month for instance it had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree\nYou know there will be some people who remember most who don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal without ever the case and if so what happened to that\n[noise] yes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume the double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ... and\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either in the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who've been laid off really to to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThat dissatisfaction with with this huge gender gap that women\nYou know have to put themselves behind men and and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically\nSo the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is ...\nTelling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to the traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing that well I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long\nThen their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media that women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um says that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's been encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\nIn every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went online and we're sharing their stories on there is a work with all the censorship going on in China will well this is what is so fascinating because in spite of the intense Internet censorship would just become incredibly sophisticated\nThat these women are ... they're so imaginative that they find ways of circulating their message and getting around the censorship censorship\nI mean just to give one example there was one activist who um when the hash tag made too as being very heavily censored\nIf I swam lakes natural science center and holding his

put them in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston\nThe hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court has some ugly consequences Sarah Verizon as a child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that student beat John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school as you did I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs little help he is of mixed heritage his dad is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um ... is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status and very quickly but then things change what happens in the school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues since right right and he I mean you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a terrorist holding an AK forty seven was ... face right All right yeah so ... yeah and a half century\nTo figure out who has sent to his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK other students are that are behind him and allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to be a kid\nAnd so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics right\n[laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do do you have to deal with it I sort of did the saying where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing\nAnd then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where it so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of it before\nYou called us polite racism and this is something to be John faces as well ... what's the difference between polite and ... where he says I\nThink most people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between\nPaintings something on your house or throwing a rock and a window versus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone\nSo how does speech on in the book realize that to understand\nI think he's he's had to deal with sort of it's in for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know stop or yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have them have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because I Do want to get away from books that are sort of like\nWhere the character has to deal with this homophobia I'd like the character to just have an adventure or\nYou know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do twenty so just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't weigh like ... and you don't want to be the ... well no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what\nWant to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes but for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with\nAnd maybe don't get a lot of media time\nWhat do you what's the pay for you is it just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people last\nIf you were in I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted to conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice\nAnd prejudice times and how can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out\nSarah ...

Baxley coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran David Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there\nI mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis as a country of twenty eight million people eight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine\nAnd what eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not a natural catastrophe it say mom made a trauma\nOver the last three and a half years I mean that neither side winning\nAnd they want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a conflict\nGoes to the heart of the trauma that he's going across the middle east at the moment the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen ... who's the to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived or they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country\nI'm what's happened since then is it a Saudi led coalition with us support and so you kind of the European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is\nVery strongly implicated in as a Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemen the control of the capital Sana'a enough Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids being led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted the front lines uh Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nGoes through the port of data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of eight and commercial traffic is getting through I'm what's happening in Yemen is that that conflict between the who the and the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians who supporting the who these\nAre the rights and the other side from the Saudis the U. S. and the u._k.\nExactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni versus Shia you also have a split of in trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south I'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my\nCase the case that I saw with my own eyes is this is a humanitarian catastrophe\nOr the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving to death\nBut at the same time there is a political emergency too because the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremists al ... and I says\nAnd it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian melt down but political melt down and look what does that mean it means that\nThe humans are a meltdown is the three and a half million people on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen or there isn't the fuel to support the hospitals are isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues that gas stations on the road\nYou've got teachers and doctors and nurses were not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself or the moment is being ravaged by war\nThat is not to the benefit of any of the signs are waging it was in fact being exploited by extremists and I think that the onus on the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S in the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one\nAnd the only way to address both the humanitarian and political emergency is a cease fire\nA winning a whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nSo hold on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. to us and the others want what's their goal\nThat goal is first of all to roll back the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians secondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand I'm fourteen or two\nAnd a third Lynn importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no\nQuestion that the who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns but what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh\nWe're being imposed on the other side\nWe should say that the U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo since the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties\nNot obviously six in the goblet because I met a ... who told me about missiles had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach of school children more than forty of them killed in August ... the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed\nA certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation that everything is being done to protect civilians why we I Know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed a Monday indirect\nEffects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not want to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority I\nI'm not costing any ad hominem judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that civilians are not being protected them to come up to the war has breached the basic the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the who the side independent un inquiries\nHave produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides and this is a a crisis that now I came away saying that the world needs to wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly\nThere was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nOn the Yemen filed but the ... needs to be picked up because there is not a current debate to replace\nThe failed un ... resolution of twenty Fifteen was something that is actually a route map to peace rather than the ... for\nIf we take the issue of 'em are refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington um you have said that regarding help from the western world\nThat you've moved to a relatively benign climate to a relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut by Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country and for a year how does that affect\nWork we'll just for the benefit of your listeners are about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today most of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh\nHistorically for the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture often children the U.S has stepped up and being a leader in what's called refugee resettlement which means bringing about on average about Ninety thousand refugees the to the U. S. actually on the Reagan Administration that was over two hundred thousand\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration\nHas first of all changed the security vetting arrangements they want you to update them that's legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduce spy Seventy five percent the cap on the number of refugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means individual lives are affected that are off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported\nThe work of the U.S military and government in Iraq translates into things they're not being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who can't now starts a new life so we're in the U.S which is part of the reason they're in trouble because I ended up being targeted because of this ... for the U.S then not being allowed in\nEither so you've got this clamp down on a refugees fleeing for their lives clamp down on people who would claim refugee status because of the work for the U.S government and the great danger is that a bipartisan program of proven success remember refugees contribute\n... in a welfare payments\nA proven program is being strangled and this year um we're having to deal with the fact that there was a historic low in the number of refugees allowed and only Twenty one thousand in the fiscal year that ended on September\nThe ... the ministry of us into the U.S a drop in this race in such a feeling of thirty thousand for this fiscal year which started on October\nBy Hopkins Center for the arts welcoming this stinks virtuoso chamber orchestra on Tuesday with a program celebrating composers that bought for unity amidst conflict\nHop dot ... dot edu\nSome occasional drizzle throughout the day temperatures only reaching the mid fifties [noise] this is New Hampshire public radio [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

remains one of the art world's most confounding mysteries a half billion dollars worth of ours were stolen from the ...\nNinety there were Thirteen pieces in all including works by Rembrandt de Gaulle Vermeer and many\nSince the highest there have been no arrests and not a piece of stolen art has been recovered WB you are in the Boston Globe of launched a podcast called last seen to investigate how and why that's the case here where reporters jak brutally come in Kelly\nWhoa [noise]\nIn the early hours of march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety the city of Boston was still celebrating saint Patrick's Day hangovers would be widespread come day break so would news that the city's most unusual museum had been the victim of a daring overnight robbery [noise]\nThey they take off and then here's what's happening up priceless collection of artwork was stolen early this morning from Boston Isabella Gardner Museum\nThere was one AM Saturday the two men posing as uniformed policemen food security guards there like me to be investigating a disturbance\nInitial estimates put the value of the selling work said it will be two hundred million dollars ... billion dollar eighty seven year old Gardner Museum is considered one of the finest small art museums in the country\nOfficials say the museums elaborate surveillance system made no\nDifference museum officials today said it was the largest art heist in history\nDespite the confidence of museum officials that the prejudice artworks will be recovered experts say they could disappear for years perhaps [noise]\nRead what was the before I Witness news\nThe thieves who pulled off the greatest art heist in history had a pretty simple plan they dressed up in top uniforms and ring the bell it was one twenty four in the morning and the thieves approached the palace road entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere have been a cake party nearby a few revelers were still on the streets and when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside\nIt really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come and so we ... them into the museum\nThat guard was ...\nThey came in and they turn so I see I could see that they had had ... that looked like a bus and the rest of the music\nSteve Kirk ... talked about that night at an Indian restaurant in two thousand Thirteen\nThe first question was as anybody else who I said my partner to get him to\nThis is the first time that former guard the one who was on duty that night with habits has ever spoken publicly about his experience\nWondering if they might just come up behind my head with a gun or the silence or and just\nYou know do a real quickly\nIt was terrifying night and all these years later he still rather we not use his full name his first name now is Randy\nIn Nineteen Ninety Randy had a passion for symphonic music the moody blues and the trombone he still plays makes a living at it mostly in house bans on cruise ships but back then Randy had recently earned a master's in performance from the New England conservatory of music he was trying to land gigs and make ends meet\nBut I always had to have some kind of a day job kind of thing\nTo supplement the income make sure the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy begin filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better\nSeven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nNighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can\nBring stuff to read and I could bring my horn and practice\nI was always happy to say yes to filling in\nRandy doesn't recall any special training are specific instructions spend the night shift\nBeyond the requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries on all the SARS during his round he did that by swiping a magnetic strap he wasn't originally on the schedule to work the overnight after St Patrick's Day Randy was filling in for another guard who had reported they called in sick\nEdited told him about the carriage has alarm but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to us at the watch desk\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston police I immediately made that connection I owe this might have something to do with alarm that went off\nOne of the uniformed man said he recognized at it and asked to see his id\nHe said yeah I Do know you there's a warrant out for your wrist and he told Rick to stand against the wall\nOr put his arms up he does the pat down he puts the cops on\nAnd on just standing there with my job and going wow you know what what's going on what to do this you really in some kind of trouble and it's still never occurred to me that they were anything but policemen\nBy stepping out and away from the deck lake Abbott's also stepped away from the still means signaling traveled to the outside world to museums panic button\nNo sooner with Abbott against the wall and handcuffed than Randy was to\nBuy kept asking him over and over why are we being arrested why are we being arrested and he wouldn't answer\nSo Cofer on\nMy hands are behind my back and then duct tape starts going\nOn around my eyes so about the time that he begins putting the duct tape on he says this is a robbery and so then everything was finally crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise] none of it made any sense and then suddenly it made a lot of sense\nI mean it's scary enough to think you're being arrested and not know why the law was going through your mind when suddenly duct tape is going around your head\nIt's very scary and I'm worried for my life [noise] um but they were immediately saying I can remember both of them saying you know follow instructions and you will knock it hurt so that gave me some relief\nAnd I just felt like okay don't try anything stupid don't trying stupid go along with whatever they\nThere's nothing here in this museum that is worth my life\nThat the bond duct tape around Mandy an address head from ten to scout across their eyes and across their mouths but only a split so they could breed than stare stare the robbers led the guards you couldn't see a thing down to the basement\nOne of the the used and other parents handcuffed to attach Randy to a drain pipe under a limestone think near a boiler Randy recall that that these let's become rather to end weirdly courteous\nThe guy who kept me he was making sure that they weren't too tight\nOn my wrist and he adjusted it several times and he said I you're going to be here for a long time so I don't want the ... these to be too tight so he was real column and real nice about it and he also several times said sorry to have to do this\nRandy just one of the guy to get away from him to go do what he had come to do to get out of there were you panicking\nUm it was scary and I remember feeling like I needed to prepare\nFor death if that\nWhat does that mean preparing yourself for death\nWas running music through my head a lot just feeling like I don't know\nWhat happens to us when we die it's all in history but um [noise]\nI just felt like I needed to be mentally\nIs there a particular piece of music that you renting in mind [noise]\nDefinitely I remember one of the pieces [noise]\nThe Mozart requiem\n\nIt didn't occur to me later that has to do with that has to do with the people [noise]\nRandy spent the next eight hours shackles on the basement floor terrified the entire time that the thieves would return to kill him [noise]", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "08"}
