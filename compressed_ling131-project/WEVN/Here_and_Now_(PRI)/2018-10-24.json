Clinton\nThe secret service says agents intercepted the packages containing possible explosive devices early today and late yesterday the time Warner center in New York City where CNN is headquartered was evacuated this morning after police were called about another suspicious package found there\nThe networks shifted its broadcast to Washington and here anchor poppy Harlow\nOn the air after being

journey than for the latest as NPR's Brian Naylor Brian what more can you tell us about what the Secret Service is saying about these physicians suspicious packages\nHi Jeremy well the the Secret Service is saying uh basically what you reported that the they intercepted too suspicious packages won a late yesterday address to former first lady Hillary Clinton a at her a or a dress to her chapter called New York home um\nAnd then early this morning a second package address to former President Obama was intercepted uh here in Washington or they were identified during routine mailing mail screening procedures the services as potential explosive devices\nAre and we're appropriately handled as such the protect these did not receive the packages nor were they at\nRisk of receiving them the mail for the former president uh both former President Obama former President Clinton is a\nScreened at offsite facilities uh went up in Westchester and one\nIn a Washington Here and that's apparently a where the um devices were intercepted do we know if there were bombs and all of these packages [noise] yeah that's the secret service is saying that they were explosive devices are in these packages it's not clear\nExactly the nature of of the devices but there have been reports that ah they're pipe bombs it\nBut we also are hearing that neither former President Obama or a Secretary Clinton were risk at any point because of that\nThat's right because they they screen the uh they screened the devices uh they they screen the mail for the the former presidents a away well

Robyn Young in Florida where one of the hottest places in the country that a little more heated\nYesterday the Tampa Bay times reporting that attacks shows the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump favorite Ron dissent is as many as twelve points in the polling\nThe two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he is the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably it's most progressive he supports\nHiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single parent health care system will have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations\nBut first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done floated could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here and at the very least we would need a conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now or a Republican Senate refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here\nHe's in Tallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nThe missile defenses described out community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what is humidity is do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community\nGet the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high law this uh you know this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality I Want to ask you about President Trump you know in\nYour debate with Ron dissent is you said he was a student for the president you made no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is without\nActs of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it President Trump's pulling numbers they bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent astute first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nA I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIt's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr ... as he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and commonsense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society in a kind of get a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in\nIran just entered says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ministry and how all this money on many for the environmental plans that you have for this day\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with\nA check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement tried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama's stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Flora two point eight billion dollars\nI'm gonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor\nMy differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure\nHelp on transportation Rick Scott and not who again don't agree on a lot politically during this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day\nPhone to talk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent advantage is now putting himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to sell reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nSitting governors Scott my opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of forest capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acres solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science\nPut some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluter to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time well\nListen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor Tallahassee democratic gubernatorial candidate here in Florida ... thanks so much for speaking to us of course take care\nPart of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from killing his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both saw it with a developer had Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum brother now the textbook Corey reads\nMike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight Gillum replies awesome news about Hamilton Mike Miller turned out to be an FBI agent part of an undercover investigation into corruption not focusing on Gillum\nGuild says his brother had it in the ticket he assumed his brother pay for it here's what he told us in our conversation\nTell us about the FBI investigation according to New York\nTimes and just going to ... there was a lobbyist friend of yours that was actually a friend as many of your friends are from your student government days and in college this is Adam Corey who introduce you to men who identified themselves as out of town developers they want to invest in property\nThey turned out to be FBI agents working undercover to investigate community redevelopment agencies possible correction you said\nMore information at Woodstock in an

exciting races to watch we've talked about the governor's race between the Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for US Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane hits and what we're hearing\nBecause the Democrats\nI'm a Republican so I'm going to be voted Republican

off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean handled and makes it into this race and his share of a vacation at a couple of friends took a you know just one trip that he took these

New England legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you online at or dash Reno dot com\nInsisting it even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket is it's just going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThat Assange is camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers questions\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know Gillum could I think he's like the third\nI'm democratic I'm a I'm an African American candidate for governor here he would be only the third in the country something like that and he is they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president's ... people in the administration\nFlorida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources where it's been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government\nAndrew Gillum is running on in teaching Donald Trump I don't know what for but I don't think he got to be able to do anything productively with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race well\nI mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump saying uh\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and being being the fantasy was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided well before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for Kennedy\nWell and make it as if they don't let me bring you in here because of passing it also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections\nAnd that's this and he calls it the caravan\nOf uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way through Mexico to the U.S border they are doing something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack\nOn the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the caravan and saying they're all for open borders\nI think this is one of those uh ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president it puts that the the issue of immigration front and center which already was to be honest in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm uh I Do think it could be one of those\nRobin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention describe and has had in the last couple of days and that he will have a in the run up to your mid term election uh we'll see that on a ... or ... depending on the journal both parties I think I read his he was a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cat and that a reporter was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar and the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last ... made got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people uh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block um you will have people who will be a of\nYou know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people they're seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point and Florida it's a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr Trump won the state in two thousand and sixteen now you have Puerto Rican so many of them who are already in Florida before money about all the security Maria\nOver the weekends I have seen a coming to Florida and that are um some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor race and and and the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nGilman said he wants to raise taxes forty percent\nAnd also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher tax higher tax over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another\nUh apparently you never got your mouth washed out or so after fellow live because\nYou keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh and daily from WFSU here in Tallahassee always colorful but who's the chair and especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the edge here yeah I I mean\nAre you know there was a the latest Quinnipiac poll released I think yesterday had Nelson's lead a at

I think that we have our political differences but we all have to be careful about our political rhetoric and I think when you identify member of the opposite party is evil or as the mob or accuse somebody of paying for terrorists to come through Mexico to the United states\nUh you know words have consequences\nAlice any any any to get an opportunity there because if you're of course referring to President Trump and why didn't they didn't know that you know what else do you think the rhetoric has been ratcheted up the you know especially to talk about the caravan\nA which is you know very far away from the U.S border and happens quite frequently these groups of people organized by you know left leaning church is trying to help people get ready to status very few of them ever make it across the board are your thoughts on that and the language we've been hearing\nRobin we can all agree that the rhetoric began to be heightened well before the caravan and it it's it has got to stop and just started in the\n... presidential campaign that the name calling and the the um disparaging comments at a on both sides but but uh it has to stop and I said all I Do not equivalent what is it ...\n... ... you say both sides do you think I mean the president is is using words like mob or you know do you think\nThere's an equivalency ... look the there needs to be a more civil town in the way we talk people on the left are angry and for us\nMore information at Red River charitable foundation dot com [noise] mostly cloudy this afternoon chance of rain showers for most of the state mixing with some snow showers in northern New Hampshire\nHigh temperatures today in the forties for tonight it'll be partly cloudy and southern parts of the state ranging mostly cloudy and northern New Hampshire where the chance of snow showers they're low temperatures tonight our twenties to lower thirties this is an H PR\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

former felons have to wait at least five years and petition the state board did win back their rights\nBut on the vendors sex voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution and automatically grant the right to the to more than one million people convicted of a felony\nIf it passes amendment for would restore voting rights to former felons upon completion of their sentence

released in the year two thousand since then he's gotten sober and started this nonprofit to help others turn their lives around but finding\nPerson about second chances because I Know people change and I know the way I was if those people have those opportunities they wouldn't be going back to prison and our community would be better for the\nWhite has already cast a ballot in favor of a madman for something that as a form of selling himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore his voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally returning home and try to rebuild my life partner that wanting to be a part of the community couldn't happening now so I was able to vote\nIn twenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for non violent felons to gain their rights back\nHis administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott as approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand under crust\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past felony conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three Cain remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nI sat at a car that he hadn't even going to be able to feel deprived I felt ashamed of failed ignorant there was a real bad Philly a thing that I I haven't even forgive him or herself for feeling like that\nCain says he wants to get his rights back but the process as intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we live alone so other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons and everybody sitting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against amendment for he said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but giving what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong that potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be\nDecided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for\nThe seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making Florida less safe Leon county sheriff wall to make Neal agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nOr as relates to other things like ah you know the sexual matters who are those keeping them away from kids in the way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those are appropriate steps to take\nBut just the a fundamental right to vote there is no proof that are taking their right to vote away the tourists them from any of the crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole condition that showed ex felons who's right to vote was automatically restored under Governor Crist were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic fundamental rights who was a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to give up and turned to a life of crime or 'cause there was no alternatives left to him\nSomething James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer\nHe got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nAre used to have ideas about who I wanted an office to certain things or we go to Bob ... show really made me feel lifted a citizen it kinda made me feel like well who knows what we're\nSort of recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if you'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me it was kind of like a book of this part of a book lists I'm not a political either and I'm not sure what level do a drug test me for that and like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy or group of former felons is suing the state in a case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip Florida Supreme Court and a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats\nGovernor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends\nBut the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican round the census will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland nice even person I'm explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get to hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into this\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor I it's\nVery different but I can hear president or former president Barack Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you you wanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state\nOf the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis picky Clinton's 'em all part of a ... you could say a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for the decisions and so forth record how important is as\nIt is critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activists judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders\nAnd this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because\nThese are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under its Republican leadership is likely to continue pushing these things as they have in the past\nWell this is also become a big part of your ...\nAndrew Gillum would bow to pressure by out of state radical groups to pick 'em up these activists judges that you just referred to hell is is that factoring into that campaign\nWell it's certainly playing a role in the conversation um but I don't think it's sort of raise and to a level where most people are actively thinking about you know who whoever gets the governorship will make\nHopefully cloudy this afternoon chance of rain showers for most of the state mixing with some snow showers in northern New Hampshire high temperatures today in the forties for tonight partly cloudy and southern New Hampshire arranging the mostly cloudy and the north where the chances no showers they're\nLow temperatures tonight or twenties to lower thirties [noise]\nThis is an age PR [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

I don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them and we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contract isn't the way over here\nAnd and these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner\nAnd that's climbing so at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college and for many people the college just the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums\nSo they can go through a future builders America which is a high school program transitioned into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school and they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read the average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but
