world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet let's start looking up and being more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were seeing what people are\nWhere even seen our impact of on this planet and\nSo we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people say we're always talking about stars right but it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this thin shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere it's this planet that warms us and called us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I'm very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nWe have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nSo it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change [noise] well\nI Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we had these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do in my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet\nSo yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we wasted and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster we really care about each other but that carried only happens\nWhen we're come face to face that I can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us\nLook up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you know as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have no I actually\nHave a view of earth that I think we all can have\nThat view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up [laughter] and\nAnd imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ... that we have that's completely free we're calling it a ... ... is a sky selfie [laughter] and that sort of like our\nHi you know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions why we have you because you you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years\n[noise] so let's I when I hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh the governor has in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send\nRight right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really change fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet through being able to look back down\nAt our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form and what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship and the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out ... as a crew how to live together that means that we do foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happened to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference\nThere are now are a number or a small number but a number of African American women who've gone to dispose you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color and the entire world to go up in space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\nBecause I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up but being that\nBeing the the first one was called her in the world is going to say what I realized that my responsibility is including other people\nBoth in yes being space explorers whether it's being the the rocket scientist to suit technicians you know are being a crew members to involve them in space exploration\nYet even as important is making sure that we understand that individuals on this planet have a right to be involved with space exploration that they understand the impact of this technology and how profound it can be to help us build a better world\nWCBS Nash what eighty eight point three W.

could be out for weeks and we're learning how far inland the storm reached the Tadic Rodney and Jason is emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana way there was three deaths\nAnd Rodney at you in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we took a direct hit it with any of those who was at a high cat three low key for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm hold a lot of places and people realized that this story does affect people that deep\nAnd when you've got a storm of this magnitude movie as fast as it did it held together a lot better yeah and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you stand your home was hit\nIt was it was a heavily damaged the pretty much it it is destroyed the structure stood\nThe blue part of my roof off and we're hoping to get some some adjusted on it today\nYeah well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and it it's the damage is it just off the scales bath and buildings down almost every tree has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that used to live here and come back so they don't recognize a town\nWell the county appraiser Carlin peacock till the Tampa Bay to be in that she's guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county we damage she's using tax rules an aerial pictures that you sent\nA sense that we all we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plus ... completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nOr someone with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had to rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd that after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were told to do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do I can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job\nAnd they have had very aggressive programs to bring back those trees to upgrade the grid and I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you\nHave done it absolutely awesome job of upgrading things\nWell what are some of these is because I I think we heard in one report that arise in his out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run between towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood it's just they were so much debris though they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped and so they were not transmitting\nNow you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to find a study on storm response failed in the state legislature twenty Seventeen do you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level\nUm emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does there have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know if it's so much climate change as it is is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast ... a town down and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming Mars\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level it's not a question of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee that this will change the climate of my community and\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County in Mariana Florida we wish you the best case thank you very much Mm\nWell parts of the country are lucky enough to be in Paris season so we want to take a closer look with here now residents chef ... who is in the studio Hi Hi Robyn you don't have to say I'm One of those people I Love

tend to be soft\nJuicy they're great Rob they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're going to find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most of all of them can be cooked as well as eaten raw and they are some what if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned\nOkay so that's called an Asian pair and I caught one up

Chamber Players\n\n\n\n\nVery\nFamiliar tune that this was actually made famous by the Nineteen fifty five movie the lady killers about a group of these that rent an apartment from a widow in London and they say they're a string quartet that just want to use the room to practice or this is a song that they play I've heard this in a lot of movies sense that tell us about it\nIf anybody has ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... and they have indeed his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand that in the late Nineteen century\n... there were arrangements that were made this piece went viral it's time you could say there were ... for\nA Mendel lesions for piano for saxophone for ... choir with a Latin text added\nSo is this piece has been popular will before Nineteen fifty five and the fun thing about the lady killers and to use and assume this is a word that's written for a string quartet\nTo violins viola\nCello was an additional cello\nNo there is a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks pose as a string quintet with an additional viola and not with a cello somebody should have been on to this young guys are walking around without a second child list\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is terrorists

write to string queen tests and string quartets in addition to other cheaper music\nWhat do we know about what influenced book or any who influenced him\nWhen he was a cellist early on he learned the cello he also learn singing his father was a double bass player\nHe and his father were playing in orchestras and he ... he said he couldn't make a living just by being a cello virtuoso that you had to compose music so he began to compose music\nAnd he ends up getting very wealthy patrons who demand a certain kind of music and that seemed to influence his writing chamber music rather than say a

sides of them in a in the ...\nOkay now to one of his symphonies this is the symphony number three in gene major played by the London Mozart players [noise]\nOh\n[noise]\nSo one of the things that I hear there is that this was obviously recorded in a big hall or which I loved that you can tell that by listening there but what do you hear that tells you something is a book or in your piece\nYou can hear again this gift from melody and he's writing this in this\nFor news at the time it's been suggested that book and read was sued detail oriented that maybe he didn't have\nAn ear for the
