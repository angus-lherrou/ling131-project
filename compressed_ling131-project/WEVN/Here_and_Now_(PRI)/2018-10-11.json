the devastation left by what was hurricane Michael\nHe's becoming more clear today the storm has killed at least two people a man in Florida and an eleven year old girl in Georgia and for some the danger is not over here's FEMA administrator Brock Long\nRight now the focus is truly on life safety or making sure that uh we're helping people who may be trapped and pushing through doing damage assessments to make sure that we fully understand where we need to coordinate our response efforts\nJoining us now is Jeff Hoffman chief meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network Jeff whereas Michael today\nOh Jeremy Michael's moving into the uh North Carolina region it has quickly moved to South Carolina this morning and over the next\nDurham area Fayetteville Greenville North Carolina the center of that storm passing near Charlotte still a tropical storm and likely will stay officially a tropical storm all the way to the coast there at the mid Atlantic states with wins in the forty to fifty mile per hour range and some heavy rain\nWell and as Michael passes over the Carolinas this is the area that was already hit by Hurricane Florence what are the concerns there\nWell the heaviest rain from that thankfully is a a little more located further inland ended amid stated upstate region still very heavy rain flash flooding concern big time in the hill country\nBut it is moving quickly us so Jeremy that it's going to mitigate the flood risk they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their craft of a week or so ago from Florence\nHave come back down they may come back up a bit but we're avoiding an extreme events in the Carolinas because it's moving quickly\nAnd what about further up in the northeast\nWell we have to watch out for tornadoes there was a tornado watch in effect for eastern portions of North Carolina southeastern portions of Virginia 'til nine o'clock tonight I Believe\nAnd uh that risk will continue up into uh uh the Delmarva area this will become a nor'easter so there's gotta be some coastal impact in New England or the center of this do should stay just offshore but I certainly of this will be a far reaching storm all the way up into the coastal regions of New York in Massachusetts and up in the main even\n[noise] Michael added strongest point was a category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this was the same a wind speed that we saw with Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S mainland how did that happen\nVery warm water on the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season where conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it it all in intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore um and it's one of these circumstances Jeremy that it was still kind of in a strengthening phase as it approached land\nAnd we've had several hurricanes in the last decade that have weakened as they approached land a reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they can be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nLots of rain today one to two inches or possible afternoon thunder storms not out of the question\nHigh today fifty seven

hundred nine four seven auto\nThis year and now I'm broadcasting from Southern California today as part of our election road trip it's part of the country that is on the front lines of the debate over immigration many California cities have taking matters into their own hands either by declaring themselves sanctuaries from immigration enforcement\nIf if you quote unquote broke the law by coming to this country to work where there is a work plenty that's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nOr by voicing their support for immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice this is really about rule of law and about to local control\nThis year a new state law took effect in California limiting how much local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities the law sb fifty four is called the California values act it's also known as the sanctuary laws and has drawn lawsuits from the Trump Administration in several cities in California\nBut the legal battle kicked off in the small town of Los Alamos which voted to opt out of the law in March and it's now being sued by the American civil liberties union list Alameda city manager Troy Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an action to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going in challenging us on that issue [noise]\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know and I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around Ellis Island me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by these things where he lives what happens with these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on on the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I probably the best example and the ... for example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she's a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait and turned to get into the United states is so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I actually you know with with my wife as an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with Los Alameda in defined the state law marks ditto is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest die\nHe said the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it it should be a nonpartisan issue and it's a public safety issue ages I is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help\nImmigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally or abused I'd met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or they were talking about criminal organizations that are doing those\nDetails says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary la\n... Vita is is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of sent on a ... about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our residents that they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity\nAnd at the stadiums here to serve them well we\nWe spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that is not about racism why um why I'm doing this\n[noise] um I don't hold back my uh laughter there if if it is a frankly a pretty shallow a response\nThere was no need for the city will sell let me just to take the position that they did other than to send a political message they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not\nA welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the dignity of every person who enters our city and that's what it means to\nBe a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor the criminals you say what that he is\nA liar and has no idea\nUh about the laws and and the law of the land he often times talks about a violent criminals and I do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city of San than I Believe that any violent criminals\nSupport for any ... live stream comes from you our listeners and from Congress regional visiting nurse association\nAnd home health in hospice agency seven people of all ages and more than forty one communities discover how the conquered regional DNA can help you remain independent in your home and live life to the ...\nThey did the RV an A. dot org\nEnforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is that's certainly what we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers um\nWe responded behaviors responded criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from ice state makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so federal authorities\nUm are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law uh we do not\nAnd so it's like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law and the and they do that so um the other pieces has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there and what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to college for help\nIf they're not calling the police who are they common right so um the ideas um to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks to call for help\nSo that's the chief of police in Santa Ana this is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail system in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump\nWhen there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates in our custody for local crimes not for ice issues or here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place it detain are on\nSo but isn't everybody in our custody it's just a small population of inmates ice has that they want that we can no longer communicate if we can communicate we're releasing them back in the community\nSo you'd think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community last day first a lot of the individuals who we do who are arrested or being returned to the communities in which they originally preyed upon so we know that to happen\nDo fail Marcellus friday October twelve that eight PM information at ... room dot com dot ... ... e A.

Center for politics I found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voters to approve of President Trump or so\nDo you want to be the the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat\nLook it's a it's a bit of an attitude that's for sure and my values in my values and my values of the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education my mother had the courage or convictions to come to this country to stick a better life so I'm as the author of centuries state or for California I'm\nAs the leader in negotiations for raising the minimum wage to the heights of the country Fifteen dollars an hour and also the author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo do ... and the greed of my values have always been for working families in California and that's who I Am I'm my goal is to be a new voice for a Californians in Washington DC and\nNow it's a it's an interesting oddity that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down the state of California doesn't make a difference if you're in northern California Southern California central coast or Central Valley [noise]\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter or I Believe that all Californians deserve a real voice it's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about do you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if you become the senator from California\nWell I can tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an opposition position with him because identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust and this was a man that was a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity tore values and to our people now that's dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency or John Case tickets they even someone like Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nEyes a Democrat and I'd be disappointed but I'd get over it in a couple of weeks and tried to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country forward together um within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that identified from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can't allow one lick toil aberration reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou've criticized Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of\nGross misconduct and said she had a ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations forward sooner a Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated do you support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a all politics I don't support the investigation of soda and find some but I Would have taken a different approach to brand cabin on two separate counts or I Would never have open the door to confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nA Senator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man a new partisan political operative\nTo hit the Senate floor for confirmation\nAnd I would not vote to confirm sixty percent of Trump's judicial nominees now these are as we know lifetime appointments and these are men who [noise] um oh surely will and do a woman's right to choose workers' rights civil rights a voting rights are environmental laws so [noise]\nUh this was something that I Would have done dramatically different than the current senior senator from California\nWhat would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked\nWhat can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you we witness um junior senators such as ... Harris I'm Cory Booker I'm a centers Richard Blumenthal I'm and I'm a descended from Minnesota uh be very sort of a and actually make motions immediately four and a German obviously\nUh I Would have followed suit as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee would have programmed to with my colleagues and and it didn't seem to be any programming it was very disjointed and I think a demonstrated a lack of leadership on a on behalf of the senior senator from California\nState you've alluded to this but let me ask you about it directly she is eighty five and refined side eighty five years old you're fifty one as a member of a younger generation what do you think that you can bring to the Senate did she cannot well\nLet me say this I don't think it's about age or ages them I I think it's about values and having the right representation to represent the most diverse in ... ah largest economy in the United states of America I think it's time that we have someone on the front lines and not on the sidelines and I think what California wants\nIs representation a representative who's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about fight for them to elevate the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or to fight for the existential threat that is before it's climate change\nTo fight for immigration reform and make sure that we stopped betraying the American born children uh and allow their parents to normalize their legal status California's home to the largest number of immigrants in the country\nYet we don't have that leadership or from California in Washington DC especially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate so that seniority has not been working for California I think that's what they want in today's day and at an age when we have a president who occupies the White House who is\nUm a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity\nTo our values and more importantly to our people\nTo you don't think she is fighting for California\n[noise] I think that ah she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country\nUm I think that the comedy um and there's bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner as the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game or in Washington with this president who seeks to undermine workers' rights women's rights are voting in civil rights as well as our environmental laws [noise]\nUh I think it takes a different type of representation in California once a a real fighter that will fight for their values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday\nDo you think the Democrats had tried to impeach President Trump if the Democrats take back the house in a very well well\nI've always said from day one that I think there's enough evidence of for a in a pinch of uh the current president's um [noise]\nI have not uh been ... dissuaded or for the position of taking it is not a partisan position of chicken I don't think Democrats or Republicans should play around with the idea of parts of the ship for political purposes or this is based on a legalities\nAnd being the commander chief ... the chief executive officer of the most powerful position in the world I think there's sufficient evidence uh for the members of Congress are regardless of who controls are either chamber to move forward with impeachment now obviously\nW abs Nashua eighty eight point three W.

PCC here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Jeremy and when you're listening there to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but they're well dressed but they're homeless\nYeah to me what their story really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know a demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness\nAnd when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain about street homelessness you know they associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nWe're getting an example I you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county next to city hall in Santa Ana but you know people started everyday when they walked past it I Can't ... has since been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis like parks are asking for money on sidewalks and is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone does his salaries can't keep up with us market rate rent\nAnd and the second big factor in that local governments\nSupport for an HP our live stream comes from you our listeners and from revision energy a local employee owned company helping thousands of granite staters go solar\nRevision energy is currently growing their team of electricians and plumbers learn more at revision energy dot com slash careers\nFlood control channel kind of right smack in the middle of the county\nBy New England Audi allergy and conquered in Manchester offering pediatric add adult patient care to help people here life better\nSince two thousand eleven more New England Audi allergy dot com rain continues today in tonight's newer rainfall totals woman anywhere from one to two inches possible tomorrow a better day partly sunny high in the mid to upper fifties this is an age PR\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.
