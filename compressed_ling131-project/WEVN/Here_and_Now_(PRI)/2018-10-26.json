track of the story and learning more about who the suspect is who has been arrested what we know for sure though it's\nCrimes have become in American politics and I wonder if you can tell us why\n[noise] well I you know I mean the polarization that has been at an all time high for quite some time\nUh you know you look back at a couple of different arrows and American history may be the Nineteen sixties and the civil war or come a closest or worse than than today but there's not much in between\nUh and you know President Trump let's be Frank has been somebody who has created the sense that the press is the enemy of the people he continues to say fake news at his rallies and\nA point the finger at the pen that we're all kept in at the rallies or behind the riser is I was at a rally in Houston people were very nice to me going in a happy to take my questions a lovely people to chat with and talked to by the end and through the middle of as a crescendo of\nJust anti a media stuff so that is what comes to be seen and President Trump has been somebody who has been a take no prisoners\nYou know I'm kind of politician for anybody who disagrees with him but Dominican\nThe president's started this week by calling for unity and then he's come to this place that you're describing now and want to hear from a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who was speaking on Thursday\nFor the price of that I\nCould not have been more presidential yesterday when he spoke directly to the American people condemn this violence let's not get lost in who is responsible for this heinous act\nIt is the person who made and set the suspicious packages let's not forget that that is ultimately the person that is responsible and will be held responsible by this administration know clearly\nThe president thinks he's being unfairly linked to the person who did this but why hasn't he been able to stick to that message of unity that he started this with\nA I mean it's pretty typical pattern of President Trump's I mean this is somebody who anytime he has criticized or becomes the sort of a focus of criticism then he doubled down he triples down he digs that uh you know

own careers in the majors\nMany of those kids leaving the country that sends the most foreign born players to major league baseball the Dominican Republic baseball greats from one Marshalls too big Papi David Ortiz to Pedro Martinez\nTwenty years ago when Pedro Martinez was pitching for the red Sox he founded a charity to help young people in the Dominican Republic\nOne of those it helped go to college in Boston was an athlete named Carol Lena\nEventually she met Martinez and they got married now ... runs the Pedro Martinez foundation the charity provides health care and nutrition for kids and the D R and D is building a charter school that'll teach young ballplayers job skills in case they never make it to the majors\nShe says only three percent of kids who recruited by the majors ever play on a team and that's a blow on many fronts\nA lot of our baseball players a lot of young prospects do not finish high school\nAnd then when they're released from any team\nAnd they want to go back into life they don't know what to do so they can be signed by a team I mean the lucky ones will be signed you're saying they never actually may make it to the team exactly and they're probably incredibly talented too of course\nIt happened to my brothers they were top prospects one was for the New York Mets and the other one for the Seattle Mariners and we should say you come from a baseball family either you're both your parents were players your mom and your dad and they started a\nLittle league and the ... that has gone on for thirty seven years now still operating ... okay so your brothers had high hopes yes they receive a really good signing bonus as both of them did\nBut they were among those Ninety seven percent that didn't make it one he was really prone to injuries and the other one he ... in the majors but did not continue there was a cut and no other factors so both of them were assigned at sixteen and they couldn't finish high school\nSo it has been painful sometimes to see them not being able to define themselves in terms of life and okay so I was relief and I'm I'm I'm twenty seven and now I'm twenty six I'm not going to go sit in a classroom with high school kids\nI'm I'm always exposed to this type of situation is because of what my parents do and because of who paid ... and it just became clear to both of us that we needed to help players that have been released\nGo back to society to their lives\nWhat could you do for somebody who's older like that like the age of your brothers or are you just trying to do a stopgap measure by helping our young people who may hope to go on to major league baseball but probably don't have that much of a chance [noise] so what we're developing\nAs curriculum that would have them be calm technicians in any than it has to do with sports and the marketplace that means nutritionist\nProfessional trainers and my ... therapist positions that are related to the sports industry and they can go back and get a job either with another team and Emma Lee or\nMaybe at an amateur level but it's a way that they can go back into the sports world and make a living for them without being baseball players\nBut is it realistic given the amount of jobs that are on offer there that that would be the answer for for so many of the kids\nIt could be realistic and as American all thirty teams of M. O. B. have academies where they signed the players so there's a high demand all the time for work\nSo the world series is going on right now and one would think for young people in the DR that there are so many sitting desk going to be me one day [laughter] do you\nAnd Pedro when you go there and you go there are a lot find yourself having to say to young people you know I really hope so but probably not so have a plan B\nWe do it in a way that it doesn't kill the dream\nBut grounds them what do you do when you say just exactly what you said that baseball is not everything\nThat there are other options in life yeah but then they see Pedro yes but then they see Ninety seven percent of others that did not make it and it's becoming more of a conscious conversation topic in the Dominican Republic about the difficulty\nOf becoming a baseball player and how it's not only enough for you to have your raw talent\nThere's so many other factors that go beyond your control even the fact if you find a coach and triple layer double A. that doesn't like you if he doesn't like you he's not going to give you play time period\nYou started out wanting to be a sports broadcaster you married to a sports star you are now in charge of this foundation that is clearly changing lives in the Dominican Republic something I imagine you couldn't have anticipated for you\nMaybe you can synthesized the reward you get out of doing this [noise]\nSo I see it as a domino effect\nI was helped at some point my institution\nNow I have a commitment to the kids and my country to do the same so I'm One but I represent five hundred kids or maybe a thousand or maybe two thousand and that other kid that I'm going to be helping or that two or three or four they represent five hundred or one thousand or two thousand [noise]\nThat's what it means to me I can help and other ...

was critical habitat for endangered green sea turtles and monk seals\nToday it is mostly underwater hurricane ... tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally wiped east island off the map\nSatellite photos show only slippers of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame\nChip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in ... you were on Easter Island in July when you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane our last guy I knew it headed north from us but it never occurred to me that lights a\nHead into French ... and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunning [noise]\nPeople have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before now\nAbout it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of a undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out a there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles could um digs their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being the the style in which was the largest one ah that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of San still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the doing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turned to the north to some of the other ... ah there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... sand did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured\nThat this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's still a very strong chance of being intercepted by a hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary on this island uh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd um you know this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category\n... cents last year as hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking uh with the growth in hurricanes they're getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if\nWas a moved by the hurricane to the north north east\nThe trade when waves may push that stand back towards are worried originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a fall\nIn sea level around two thousand years ago we are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reforming the ... or don't exist\nThat ship Fletcher a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you\nAnd other conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAdjacent Chowdhury is the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because the focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searched shifting the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that shift about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economic\nIs not so much what do we want growth do we want less growth it what did we actually want from growth usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity\nUm but I actually know I can do nice pair comparison right we are very high growth rates in China we are very high growth states in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is\nA lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution all means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talk about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nOr gets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nWhat kind of movement I mean like one to give give me one thing okay so I could not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle\nTo give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money\nIs going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying it but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example you can think of to sort of a tendencies one is this sort of rise above sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation another would be very local organization\nSupport for an H ... live stream comes from you our listeners and from service credit union supporting businesses throughout New Hampshire from the generic development projects to fundamental thinking needs programs and services designed for businesses who are ready to grow more I grow with SCU dot com [noise]\nAnd from the lawn from before in Reno sustained excellent since Nineteen forty six offerings own judgment and the prodigal approach to New England is legal challenges or dash Reno dot com\nOr the rest of this afternoon mostly sunny high temperatures in the forties\nThen loading up tonight with low temperatures mid twenties nor the New Hampshire arranging the mid thirties and the south [noise]\nThis is an H PR\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

composer and guitarist Bill Frist ... is a singular talent to was all about collaboration\nIs weekend he's playing with Ron Miles circuit writer trio on the west coast built Brazil has worked with the

appeared on more than two hundred albums more than forty as a bandleader so why go solar this time around [noise]\nBut that's been a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment I picked up a guitar there was this social aspect with you know I've always been a shy person an awkward but with that guitar it was like this magic wand that seem to\nBring every one together and so\nAll along the guitar has been about interacting with other people\nIt's never been\nI Know there's you know this is the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter those alone troop adore when it first thing you know but it's something that sort of\nHanging out there in front of me that I Try to I'm just trying to get it together to be able to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take a speech ... that like talk about a nightmare situation\nIf you could only have hadn't interact with you\nYeah yeah I mean to do the talking as long as I've got that in my hands and everything is\nCool so then why another solo album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself into your well they're not at all\nYeah I don't want to make it sound like that either it's because over the years it's become just another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I\nTried to play something alone and it was really just\nSo uncomfortable and it was a drag and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought no I got to get this together so a year later I tried it again and then I kept getting better and\nAfter a certain point it was like wow I can actually do this and it started to feel like [noise] like music\n[noise] well it seems like the right time to talk about I think [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nSo when the sun like this what comes for the new or [laughter] it sounds backwards the inspiration\nFor the notes because you say it's it's a tribute to the musician these platelets in your life and you don't usually it's just a\nA melody just a very simple [noise] you know what I'm saying I'm\nWriting it but then like\nOne thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because pretty stars that\nMade the shrine and that was something I quote unquote row these signs that book and the album ... and then made to shine it in when I wrote it I recognize that it was a very very calm in court when prior\nTo the recording of this album I was playing at this club called the stone in New York\nAnd I was playing some of the music\nI Would record it played that song\nOh I Love that was a really great version of Jessie J what what do you talk about something just to\nPlay you this recording and it was like oh my God that's the same ... almost exact same melody and then I checked it out and it\nWas like you know it's just the old traditional songs like I'd probably hurt the keys to treat you play it when I was five years older than the commercials and making them to be in trouble now but I think it's a\nYou know it's like a public domain kind of thing and then there's so much music slow [laughter]\n[noise] I don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing it or it might remembering it or what is it [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nI'd love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want to look for [noise]\n\nYou know what you're hearing right now is just one or that I played on the guitar that was\nCaptured frozen and sustain the\nWith some other processing so they're sort of a drone\nOne now\nThat was originally from the guitar and then that's going [noise] like a fire drop auto pedal I think that's really kind of a shaky [noise]\nAnd then I'm using that as the backdrop for just\nOne solo guitar and [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nI was trying to stay in the state of not being sure what was going to happen you mean as you're playing yeah well the composing is you know happy now these are\nPieces [noise] they never feel like they're finished anyway but what I Do to prepare for the album was actually played six night at the dome in New York every night at brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither ... compositions of mind or new ones and I tried to keep myself just off balance for the whole week\nAnd that's what I wanted to continue on into the studio I didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really know anything when I went in there\nYou know for somebody who I don't think he would end you're younger days hide behind your instrument that takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in a stranger unusual or difficult uncomfortable place intentional well but that's\nThat's the thing about music it's like when you're dreaming you jump off a cliff\nAnd you you just start flying in that's\nThe best feeling was music for me is when you can take these chances but I say jumping off a cliff but like what's gonna happen if you play the wrong note you know you get all the thrill but you don't get banged up too much\n[laughter] what a song we did like us to go out on here\nThere's that one Monica Jay which I wrote for my daughter\nFirst time I recorded the song was was just about a month after she was born it was my first\nTrip being away from her to Oslo to record with Paul motion Johnson and had this song title [noise] we played the song and Paul motions it
