I Would say you have to read the thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part released in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question\nAnd it really key document is an internal memo written by Congress secretary Wilbur Ross who asked our secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty sexes and ... he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty cents is as soon as\nShortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen\nAnd then a over those months he worked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration give for why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least what the thing about its reasons\nWell the Justice Department or which is representing a convert secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the lawsuits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intend to his mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to better understand exactly why coverage secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question\nAdded because of the voting rights act and he wanted responses from a citizenship question to better and for section to the voting rights act which has protections\nAgainst discrimination of racial and language minorities\nAre essentially to make sure that those groups have the right to vote 'em that the law the federal government has relied on other another kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of 'em and uh the ... and says that data is not enough is not accurate enough\nUm and it needs in on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include a communication between a Kris Kobach the current Republican gubernatorial candidates\nAs well as the former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross throughout a citizenship question and his concern was that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted in census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency\nOr the Twenty one twenty census is going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what is a massive undertaking\nWell they are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross added will it stay or will it go and where you probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau spacing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play important part for live households that may not be comfortable or don't have access to Internet and so they will be paper\nAnd so this is a really big question right now that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve a from the Census Bureau perspective another big question will they the sense of being able to hire enough workers to collective uh information from households around the country\nOkay thank you NPR national correspondent ... thanks a lot You're welcome\nThe anonymous British graffiti artist Banksy made headlines over the weekend by regain his own artwork to self destruct\nHis painting of a little girl letting go of a heart shaped balloon began to shred itself just after it was sold for nearly one point four million dollars at southern ... in London\nThis latest stunt has the art world buzzing and many more people wondering once again who is Banksy Sophia ... has been exploring that question for the sun in London I said hey\nAnd first your thoughts when you saw that painting slide down the picture frame in shreds at the auction\nOh my goodness I see a hot stove paying maintenance and the question was why is it happening in and in fact with how how is it happening because obviously at the time they want to me that that was shredded built into the frame\nYou can imagine the shock and horror not just in that option ... everyone's eyes on that paints a at time\nAnd for some people listening that was their first introduction to Banksy so tell us what we know about him because he's a a a man we think who is famous for being mysterious\nHe ... he he famously being mysterious and his name is the ... of the U.S well and he he basically he's an anonymous English I test he's a street in graffiti artists that he kind of gets name as a political artist as well and you kind of shade I put it seems like the nineties and\nAnd he's black reaching any highlights of corruption and inequality is\nNowadays as human as slightly less and he takes them a series trained in his walk 'em as you say he's never been on mosques that there are hundreds of theories as to who he could be um and we still they may cause a big theory that he was in the ... when the painting the shredded\nWow so let's talk about some of the theories then what you know because there are people who who think they've seen him at work doing one of the installations on a wall somewhere or in what you know we don't know who you're so um what are some of the theories about about who this ... this mysterious or this might be\nThey have ranged from him being a painter and decorator to another graffiti artist named king ... and people say he's Damian Hess people even say that\nYou know banks he may well be a woman and there's another theory that he's and not just one person he is a collection of artists it's just because he's such a a an icon of mystery the the theories range from what could potentially be the tree to something very outrageous and I think there was a\n... they said he was the from mine if the bonds and because every time that bad and performed in this that and like ... see the ... pop and the guy had to come out and saying it's definitely not me I have a creative bone in my ...\n... what do you think he was trying to say bye shredding painting\nIn my opinion and I think he's trying to say that his wife is not for sale it's not the fast time his what has gone up for sale and and it's something that has been done without his consent\nThis time I had to see I I this is just my past and opinion on the opinion that certain people I ... that the painting and the shredding if the painting was away at him saying my\nWife is not for one pass and it is for everybody and because this painting you know eat it shut it off to the humble wet and it was a way of him saying they swap doesn't belong to anybody he he never paints inevitable his graffiti odds in a place that\nCan belong to one pass and he does in public spaces he does than in places where it would be very difficult to remove them or for anybody to claim that that all black\nAnd I think that's what he did he wants his message and he wants his what to be for everybody rather than one passenger take ownership is at other theories I've had a he wants his what to have a great says Ali\nOther times I've had that he wants his wife to be priceless that could be it could be a number of things and and my personal opinion is that he just doesn't want anyone to in his message\nNow one of the questions people are asking it how do you hide Schroeder inside a picture frame

insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen your kind of telling themselves about how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor\nAlso a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he finds one of the letters takes it home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen deer Evan Hanson and so he's they think their best friends\nAnd for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control\nAnd also kind of changes him Steven Livingston this idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well I um he feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who course isn't I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother are struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they\nI'm not [laughter]\nYou have to how you were able to put those feelings into a song [noise] what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music\nTo get across these characters\nYou know it's true I'm enjoying that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was\nYou know how do you take the would become sort of temple moments on the musical how do you take that and translate it into a book it is an interesting process of how do you get inside of characters head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book\nUs to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and uh and same token\nBe a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow know any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people then he's in your hand\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel [laughter] yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had slightly hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty hair becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before but I felt like I knew how to do this or emotionally I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to have and and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you add that I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nBut we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of there is in a in a mission they gave me to tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't wanna give anything away but I have to say we actually find out is ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYeah this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know\nObviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does and it was important to us that it not feel\nMano causal I'm like there's this one thing that ... that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're you know doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't ... I understand that\nWhy you did they did what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about Evan Connery what might happen\nThis is Justin you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of\nThat there were a fence around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listen to the cast album or read watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident corner and and I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place\n[noise] big\nThanks to everyone it took a moment during the recent fun drive to support an HP are because of your ongoing commitment were able to provide this unique service to New Hampshire if you haven't had a chance to contribute yet there's still time to get to go to an H.

general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits keeping confidence is that continue to this day\n... professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were ego that people take care of their team and take care of themselves\nRecognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams they have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a civilian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult uh in in desperate\nSays you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores of Greece a pretty high margin is quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with ah the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa I'm a
