S. seeking asylum but it is happening right before the midterms what are the political implications\nFor the political implications are pretty big\nAnd he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the midterms he's not only said without evidence that they are criminals he's even said that there are terrorists or he's repeated some of the a commentary on Fox News that they are members of ISIS or al ... somehow\nIn the group of people who are traveling to the border by the way they are about [noise] last time I checked there about three thousand miles from the U.S border but he's been saying that Democrats are funding them so this is an issue that he thinks\nEnergize his base it's what he started out when he came down the golden escalator talked about in Mexico sending rape is this is his go to issue\nA lot of Republicans would prefer that he focused on the economy and the strength of the economy right now here is a President Trump speaking to reporters outside air force one on Saturday\n[noise] we'll look it up again very major tax cuts for middle income people [noise] and if we do that it'll be sometimes just prior I Would say to November [noise]\nHave made your tax God we are going to be putting in [noise] that are setting very deeply right now around the block a major tax cuts for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even in session a right now and November is coming right up ... what do you make of this\nHe's just making it up as he goes along there are no plans to put their Congress as ... as you said they can vote on this\nBut he said it's going to be major it's gonna be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular Republicans thought they'd ride these the tax cut bill to victory in November but people don't buy it broke our and see polling Republican Party polling has shown that people think the tax cut when mostly to the rich but this is\nWhat President Trump does you know he used to call this truthful hyperbole and some of his books\nYou know he's talked about liberals rioting for sanctuary cities he talked about how the arms deal to Saudi Arabia he started out saying it would produce forty thousand jobs in America now he says it will produce a million jobs he said Democrats want to give luxury cars to illegal immigrants I mean he's just improvising\nDroning partly cloudy this afternoon with high temperatures today in the forties Italy clouding up to nine we'd lows in the low to mid thirties\nMostly cloudy tomorrow some afternoons showers with high temperatures mid forties to around fifty degrees Wednesday and partly sunny in southern half of the state mostly cloudy and the north where the chance of rain snow and sleet in the morning before changing over the all rain\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

provoked worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of the night\nBut then what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released\nTheir story is told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha I think he is so the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families and their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we always used to kid the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the delta that lots of happened to the\nGym three is that they were held by but her um why am partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we that goes wherever it leads to may we started filming with them and not government safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite well they um with still processing what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when a council is to push them into reliving intending as well as it happened that we tried to give them the ... film in the space to if they wish to but he could eat anytime we let alone with the guy does the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly\nSo it's twofold I think the government will say wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they held the three is this little ... down and they were released\nTheir time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to is they did give us that diaries discreetly\n... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't ... that they were forced to marry if not they would have the what they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and\nIn the film what we do is the uh the girls that that you book goes who have taken would actually just the tip of the iceberg there are thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram who are free to speak\nAnd they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because ah you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier fool you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave then you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the ... like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we fast Matt had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love my baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... have been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay well ... has been conducting children but also say older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fights and then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill an arrest\nOr people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just flooded their towns out of fear of ... living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah is it functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns in these they called them id Pete camps or intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run too because Boko Haram you know they don't just could not then the un and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous but also safety by numbers on the Web the food aid is going to see how if you want food\nThey're they're all ... but then a lot of the\nUh uh loves internally displaced people end up living within the community so despite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they've also been incredibly welcoming to the numbers the space people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize it's controlled ... Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line woods I Know you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said that's a lot of mistrust [noise] what\nAbout the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and trying to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your from\nI'm not in the last ... because in the ... and it has changed my life now all of the nation I mean ... even though right ... [noise]\n\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes I think uh\nSo that your book goes who are are in a un of the American University of the American University in Nigeria which is where all the girls who were released a negotiated full and uh the escaped girls who on the nights that to\nThe kidnapping happens so Jones in Seventy six were kidnapped\nFifty seven of them during the long journey on the back of trucks to some of these various kind of jumped off the back\nAnd half of those have gone straight to this uh University in yoga\nIt's going to be turning partly cloudy this afternoon high temperatures in the forties clouding up tonight overnight lows loaded mid thirties and then mostly cloudy tomorrow afternoon showers with high temperatures tomorrow mid forties to around\nFifty degrees this is an H PR\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair\nOf five and a half minute blocks of branded content here's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy\nMore on Fox has only ... what do we have fought for skin they listen to ... take on brunch I'm with a five minute we can we can say what if you live for the Sunday Edition sponsored by Google visuals race\nHere now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into brand of content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAll right let's take this first change Fox is calling it the nine ... nine second sixty second breast started be nine sixty seconds breaks jazz pods ... what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial ... so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second year this has got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching as\nThe also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to you\nAdds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand the content there were these spooky and yet it's sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nShow the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for\nThe reduction in in volume do advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air is worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say in the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain nuts\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much and I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders Sam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car and you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that all cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority in that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works right now it's available in what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYet so you ... you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like the rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to a Tesla to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's ... ah which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access the more this market grows for all players\nSupport for an HP arts live

so you know I think that the way we\nThink about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing a they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of\nSolutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for that money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like to over so it was continue investing was partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWell speaking of ... I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact it taught him was cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and it's maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those carts be used by more people different cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opened a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around were checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me than drop it off and then it would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were were fifty years out in the town of me as sort of\nA mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where you know the cars you know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around ... and outside of cities in suburban areas\nUm any of those cards might be self driving but they're fundamentally not you know self cleaning or self maintaining until there's a lot of infrastructure and sort of network function is required to sort of operate those vehicles and that's very close to even what we do today right we help owners share cars efficiently in urban centers across the United states\nW E v J Jackson Ninety nine point five\nWBFO cobra Ninety point three W.

over the death of Saudi journalist and us resident Jamal ...\nThe kingdom says he died in a fist fight inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October the second many people doubt that explanation Turkey's president ... says details of what really happened will be revealed and a speech that he will make tomorrow\nJoining us now is Jane Harman president of the Wilson Center and a former Democratic congressman from California\nGentlemen welcome back and you think the u._s. should consider new sanctions against Saudi Arabia over this\nI think condoning murder is something we should not stand for our foreign policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country are rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region and surely Iran has been engaged through proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting\nIsrael but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen and Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia's in Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also\nAh suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old crown prince\nA has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view it's not something the U.S would dictate\nA to have a a ... you know some kind of a\nAdult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be and Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen has created the the largest could humanity to humanitarian catastrophe that we currently she and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot ah to to do this is a really shocking and in every sense\nBut do you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now and and hasn't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this was going to change President Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI think the Trump Administration wants Saudi Arabia as a good ally in the middle east and also as a good trading partner I think those are two agendas that it has and ah I'm not against either agenda um but what I'm against is condoning bad behavior or in order to make sure that agenda continues\nDroning partly cloudy this

endorsement to New Jersey is democratic Senator Bob Menendez than it does is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race as a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nA German so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in the midst trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign event he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say she has been struggling to break into the lead in this race is an elite by um you know some recent public pools but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nAnd ... and has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with imminent as Syria's on Fox News or\nHundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that are there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who've been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob he's he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about just [noise]\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting [noise]\n... you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not ties with three times for drugs that those cancer patients politically\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the cost of the drugs that his former company makes his call for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at ... as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients a vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up cell gene has also you know uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump spent a hundred thousand dollars on the\nCampaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the the Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but\nHe has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about him it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty pretty reliably democratic in that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that\nHowever these races do happen um you know New Jersey often does elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican congressmen frankly beyond does retiring this year after\nIt's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party and just to you know popularity previously\n[noise] that is Joe Hernandez of W H where I was talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got it\nWell known now that our next story might not

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity when what really shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted\nTo go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that\nTheir phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted but Ninety five percent of teens um have a smartphone now\nAnd it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post a like an ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I Jim is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history\nAnd that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with whether asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell that's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft road that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\n[noise] yeah they do have to market to this generation differently because there's this such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adult but in their conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors\nHere very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness\nAround stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\nI Wish I could say yes I'm\nBud statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting\nOr are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say that they're interested in government or social issues or politics Dan teams were say Twenty years ago what do you think so um well I think because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a you know something new to see on I'm On social media or new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had some many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general [noise]
