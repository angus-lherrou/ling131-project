want to be right food you know we get our water above\nMy ... my readers and everything redo everything is so much better than it was the worst problem when you say clean is it because all the water came up in the mud contamination won't clean there's just got to be fresh was really I mean just a lot of work [noise]\nThat work includes moving heavy industrial palate and constantly spraying mudslides and then for this processing plant opens out onto the day we can see buckle broken dogs and idle or Easter both hurricane Michael landed a punch year\nBut this was an industry already on his knees there's the fears water wars freshwater from the Appalachian coal river flows from Georgia to Florida and the Supreme Court recently agreed with Florida that George it takes too much\nLeading less of the fresh water to lower the salt level in the bay and keep that day the salt loving creatures that prey on oysters then there are oil spills over harvesting climate change which brings severe

now there are hardly any native Cloisters and Tommy son TJ has turned to aquaculture growing baby boisterous or stat without you know [noise]\nBut the words were also leading a sight to see the oyster shells with Beatty oysters and place them out of the bay to try to bring the native oyster reefs back and now Michael\nOutside the plant and exhausted Tommy Ward holds his stomach\nLot to do you know you got to get it done this nerves you know just\nToo much of the good stuff in orange county or why are we going to come back bigger and better and stronger and we're going to be our\nI'm about ready to quit and with that this big tough choice jamon space purple\nWe are still looking for when the time these kids TJ when we find Tommy's brother Walter er Jackie as he's called anti Jay's wife

they know that\nYou need is Thirteen miles up the day we finally find TJ Ward at that or is there a house he said he wanted to see after Michael it's been in the family for over a hundred years sitting out on the dance he said surrounded by protected land not another building inside heat is gorgeous\nAnd it is pretty much a complete loss okay oh boy\nI mean I I see this electrical socket

of course not insured but TJ says they'll rebuild maybe smaller and he'll keep aqua farming oysters growing the baby oysters called stat without shells hanging them off polls out in the day\nBut his dream is that a consortium of government agencies colleges private industry create hatchery swear spat can be grown on old shells into oysters that deals with the water and procreate and create reefs that provide barrier for storms and living snakes and other creatures\nEspecially state universities that have the technology and the demands and also students to to work with the department of

in terms of talking about the storm that has come in\nMarshes protect from storm surge flooding so those are going to slow down wind and rain Florida hoist or population Ninety percent of it was coming from the Appalachian coal ... percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters an indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population and the scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp\nAnd so when you see this\nChallenge with wasters guess what you're going to probably find out you've got challenges going on with your other parts of your system\nYou're the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river and really get\nWhy it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nBut you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river may mean to them and you will get you will get many stories of why people love this place in our fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers say do it in front of this [noise]\nWe've retreated to the river keepers office of boats have had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Coleman director of Florida state's coast and we love\nHer colleague Dr Sondra brook and write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this I'd say the most spectacular\nFishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all its nutrient is not coming down into the salad needed water and not coming down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish growth\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like this all to your water\nYes when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with soldiers that encourages these marine practices such an oyster drills and ground Koch\nWithout these oyster journals that sounds like a horror film duct duct tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like come out\nThey sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot you can do about it it is rather horrific\nYeah check it out on YouTube it's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish let's start with\nAnd a an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if we're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and ... all the moisture is the fear was that\nIn a couple of years later and there was no brood stock left there to re populated I think about the function the set oysters surfaces beyond\nThe economics like clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race or she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion one of the problems with a day over the last few decades has been reaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and if that\nPaul ... is that ... shell what they larval oysters settle on but distributing it without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when what\nWould you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the drought that have been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what doesn't have to be\nFair particular types of research that can be done that could\nRelatively quickly and the next couple of years to make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what NATO but they want their livelihood restored so there is a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea\nAnd I think you would find fishermen that fully support that full Dr Bruce ... research and really a committed effort instead of throwing short term solutions what about in desalination plant I think\nThere are more problems in the bay on just ... you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but they always just haven't come back\nUsually want a system crashes it's not just one thing but there are also other factors in play you know the the reefs and they're not as high as they used to be we don't know where the lobby\nOf coming from or what does the topography of the bay looked like you know how much of the coach sits where it is it's all these questions that will help us\nFigure out a way of making a comeback\nYou this is so interesting because after a Sandy we did a lot of reporting on people who want it to bring the oyster beds back to New York harbor it used to be filled with ... as a barrier against that storm coming in you know pass the statue of liberty is a solution aquaculture and we're

everyone who was displaced by the storm are are those people on the shelter so we can imagine that that number is much greater it and not you know down runners that ...\nWas among the with family or friends or in cars or your colleague Lynn had her spoke with conscious Denise clam Sheila's Invictus from a low income housing project in Panama City because of the storm\nSupport for an HP ours live stream comes from you our members and from the law firm of or in Reno sustain excellent since Nineteen forty six offering sound judgment and a practical approach to New England legal challenges find out how or in Reno can help you on line at or dash Reno dot com\n[laughter]\nSo you multiply her I'm sure by many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any recourse she got a FEMA rental assistance\nAnd his waiting on a check 'em but but then what I mean where she's supposed to she can find housing but where she's supposed to find housing\nRight that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers or that you can use to stay these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there really there's about twenty that are accepting has now chairs\nAnd did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers but there seems to be a you know at some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here\nWe come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seeing sort of this slow response there also shelter is of course\nYeah well it will ah and by the way we see FEMA people all over the place in their boots teachers they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter in a local high school and just want to listen to how\nWe say we were in charge and maybe it was just like all the windows busted out back\nAll the trees come down and landed right beside the church though yeah [noise] um I haven't yet her house was destroyed a brother in law just houses destroyed ... homes\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this is driven home or in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes and not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are\nHomes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Mickey Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people are showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some permanent calls one that gives them the ability of last fall we got here they don't have either\nAnd so I've got like Robin assistant manager we call him Dr seuss loss is allowed\nBut after two days he's been here with our through small immigration just describe like just friday has a job that he can recover and the law says that there's more calls\nNow when he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by if they have no income\nI think that it's tough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about at Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process so that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state but again\nYou're a man who maybe don't have a good way of tracking what their income has been and so they don't have a good way of applying for that it's just ...\nYeah the running water mostly back in some places it's not drink a bull communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really ... I have to say it's just\nRemarkable to see the trees uprooted everywhere even hear it you know inland Tallahassee rules off high school fifty miles inland it's really a quite humbling\nA ... ... s S. W. as as you senior news producer of Reagan McCarthy thanks so much for sharing your point and I think you will be talking about housing even though I was able to return to homes and it's unbelievable game all had pictures that here in our dot org are having trouble hearing loss could Bentley went to the coast and brought back to smoke [noise]\nMuch of the area between Mexico beach in Port saint Joe looks like a hurricane went through yesterday not two weeks ago\nCars in boats are turned on their sides and strewn across the street from the ... homes are split wide open there's debris everywhere\nBut for those able to return to their homes just part of the Florida Panhandle as one big construction site\nTroy Bryant's watches as workers tear the shingles off his room\nThere are number one all the changes I just had the new route but all last September\nBryant and his wife ... bought this beachfront property and moved here from Georgia earlier this year\nThey stayed in a hotel in Mariana Florida during the storm and return two days later to find their new home intact but severely\nDamaged well when I first drove up I thought well that's a you know the garage doors will money but I thought was so bad [noise]\nOutside to the back door the garage and it opened up and then that's just what you're seeing right here [noise]\nI had a white picket fence that we had just built all around the front of the house they're part of it in the back part of it in the garage\nThat house right there\nUsed to be right there\nBrian says that house is forty feet from where it used to [noise]\nJanice and Allen Cronin live a few blocks from the beach they were on vacation and Tennessee when the storm hit and when they came back they found four feet of water swept through the building\nThey also saw whole houses lifted off their foundations and swept into the streets by storm surge high when\nThe second law most album\nHave some sort of damage of course they\nThere's was pushed up for it got kind of total you know\nAnd there's a house in the streets of your house is it was a\nCatty corner that long [noise]\nAnd so when the storm surge came up and started flooding of course in it and just world it around\nAnd of course you say our neighbors car wound up in her now\nThe Cronin are spending their new retirements repairing their house by hand living at a camp or in their backyard they're determined to stay but Salinger Cronin says this area will never be the same\nBase a large percentage of these homes that were owned\nBy grandma grandpa\nGrandma and grandpa was not going to rebuild and your\nGrandma and grandpa was settling\nUh keep in mind that a third to half of the house has been here we're actually built you before Nineteen Seventy they were literally not built to any hurricane code they were built for\nAnd people have lived in them for years now they're not going to live for many more hands in five years this will lead to sign plus it was\nLifelong resident Clark downs and his daughter Kimberly downs Norton rode out the storm and carts house\nI was confident on a category one or two but then after I realized it was going to be here for it was too late\nAnd but like the way we were surrounded\nThey're helping their neighbors clear down trees from this yard\nClark says Michael was historic\n... even when I started school here in in elementary school there's a book called the great ... where the city was destroyed three times one so far\nUh watched by yellow fever and wants a title wife which was really a hurricane or a cat and this was number four combat what he said that\nI just know the people are coming back at us already come into\nYour already building well yeah I've got three first comment I've got two people come in to straighten some of the messages out so yeah oh yeah\nIt'll be partly cloudy tonight and low temperatures in the twenties middle cloud up tomorrow when the pies in the forties when Saturday cloudy with rain mixing with some snow in the morning in northern New Hampshire\nHigh temperatures in the lower forty\nAnd it'll be cloudy showers likely on Sunday night temperatures upper forties to lower fifties [noise]\nThis is an H PR and [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nIt's hearing now which way work long the other day we go that's kind of happy to the beautiful color strings lodge wherever between the lodging the honor the men seem to be serving their archaeologist under ...\nTen feet wide three feet and millennia deep\nCSP lined up just right to make it work properly or I got a four point seven six to ... nuts yeah you're on it on okay good good\nI'm Dr Andy ... with your solar research Institute and we are at the edge of a pit that we're excavating dating from modern stuff right at the top all the way down to potentially maybe Fifteen thousand years ago some of the earliest occupation\nNot only in Florida but in the new world wow we're kind of just getting to the the good stuff as we get through the earliest Holocene material and get into the end of the ice age the end of the the terminal places the material\nWill be looking at things in the twelve to fourteen and it's like I said as much as Fifteen thousand year old rage [noise]\n\nBuckets are lined up shovels gently pushed across the floor ... thousands of years with every layer careful exacting work you never know what you might have been finding stone tools just somebody knocked a big flake off it was really sharp on one edge so they took a little on what a\nPiece of answer or another hammer stone perhaps interest sharp wounded up a little bit more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing in again in the five six thousand year old range part of today's excitement has been that we had a little lens of charcoal\nAnd as we dug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it a Tom said perhaps corn cob it a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old ... here but it's conceivable\nSo so that'll be that'll be the excitement this afternoon as removing this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal in it\n[noise]\nThe scraped material is dumped into the buckets and poured out over what looks like a screen door laying on its side on legs now move over here to a screen everybody knows that this looks like it's framed and you're brushing that fans truly looking for\nA fun flakes of little pieces of stone that there were when they were making a projectile point\nThere's one is that when you put it right in the [noise] the tiny tiny\nScissors taking an I'm an ... an sharpening on heroin or a projectile points and then make these little tiny flakes\nTraveling down there a larger ... larger when it's a half a quarter of an inch long yeah big yeah that's a big one\nI didn't know that's what they were doing that\nThere is there some may have for the call these primitive arts festivals where people are making arrowhead dizzy\nAnd this is a double ties that is what's on the floor after they get through the making of same during\nThe ... this was probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand you know All right this is cool\nBut that wasn't my hand that Dr heading who just wiped out a few hundred years of history with one there's so many ways miss that [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slips may not be artifacts are most beneficial to archaeologist they reveal their story best when they're found where they were left and storms like recent hurricane Michael can disturbed that\nIf you stand in place long enough you can feel the same ... a little bit and it's caused you know snow into problems and agitation ...\nDo you think that's the rain as you as you shake your fist at the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently excavated and that's really why we were so very concerned is that we have an open excavation pit almost a meter deep with\nThe letter day for the better part and on those in years we've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered those with tarps stand by the whole thing and we we are awful awful lot\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by a man who devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes was laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologist Kelvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the lodge in Nineteen Ninety four and that's when some of the most important earliest ones were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got\nA real barrel of loan delivered to his home and he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this dirt is more than dirt as part of this ancient burial site you know\nThey had a delivery of dirt and within the ... there were are facts\nThat is archaeologist Barbara causes a Florida public archaeology network\nAnd we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of long meeting to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others [noise]\nOkay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean how how high near would you say this ...\nThis is the tallest up the southern mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt and let's just backup what exactly is the mound this site is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex\nWhich is the south eastern regions\nVersion of the Mississippi in culture\nKnown by many as the mount builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain a hot when that person past they would then be and hurt are buried in the mountains and their home would be burns and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so over time it became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to\nKind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burn holes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pie or is that\nIt's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today it's a definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climb the stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would have done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nAre there native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who lived here the\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana and come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we're not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up the mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know this concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking\nSince the year one thousand a de these mounds and we're right on top now these mounts have weathered uh was it a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part in the mountains and\nRainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are ready on top\nOf the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community we'd get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have Lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other sites similar to that throughout the south east all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating here at like Jackson\nThey were finding copper brass plates or ... ... we don't have proper in Florida so it was evidence of trade with those other places\nUnderstanding this mound when it was excavated there would be a family there was a dog at one point\nThey found women they found one child I Believe he was about eleven years old and yes there was a dark burial", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here
