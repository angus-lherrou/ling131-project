our own noting it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak rose in his presidency the American Jewish Congress\nJak words fail you know we're so sorry about this route to community\nBut has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nLike first thought is this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tech not only the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was Jews have been living in America is comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country\nShe changed since the fifties and sixties and in the bushes Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities and here we are in one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface goes probiotic ally but it seems to ... a good number of people in America\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred Jews make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous year have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we see more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols of loan Jewish cemeteries schools the SAT on Saturday is quite a shock to the community in America it seems\nAnd you know we only the so the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out I Hope you're feeling that support from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing\nExcept you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents do you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but\nThere there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize so political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any major changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe uh\nKnow some of this viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system\nYou know the answer to this or a political leaders they have the microphones most important political leaders of president as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from both parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are met governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize yeah with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell uh actually cemetery we're hearing the opposite for president have been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching right nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these

but let's listen to these marches again in charge now\n\nIt sounds on the documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter allegedly county in synagogue that had to be chilling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of\nThe wrong song being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having a big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all working hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make\nIt was just happened to be watching Clinton sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nHas shot and I know NBC yeah discussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred\nThat he shows been showing you the wrong county's been setting you said to myself what about ...\n... you're speaking of ... leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why aren't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and Trump's Republicans but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nJoe hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible you know he has to since he has the biggest microphones she's going to have to uh you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most\nBut we shouldn't forget other parties wall leaders don't just get a pass\nOr in the mail ... said that they were fine people on

I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody else where the party argue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle them but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books in certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes since they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think um need a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people\nBecause of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend is all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nOr it could be boats or maybe the friend is the narrator [noise] you know\nAnd what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my ... my married are really does Mitt there's just something I definitely share with my narrative she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that and to our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet that can live without me she just much happier with the idea\nThat her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that she is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her\nIf the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's [laughter] that's very moving well and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and\nTook it I just have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle the story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the symbols don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have that ... is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it\nAnd that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it was all about a dog in you know it was such a punch\nPick up the friend um and how much of this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student riders but is the suicide maybe someone you didn't know because we read the germ of this was people who you knew who are contemplating suicide\nW.

the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for words\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks

Hitchcock is here\nHow might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city not that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states\nBut just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health thing on the table than let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take in into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department

implement this in grade school what might a specific part of a curriculum the and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings get della thing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's ah got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nThat emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness county\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young

senator look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible again we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want to\nIt's a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma talk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues\nAnd we hope that as more and more these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that\nYou know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about
