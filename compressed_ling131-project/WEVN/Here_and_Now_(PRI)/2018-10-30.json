S. and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he will introduce legislation that mirrors what the president wants to do\nJoining us now is Alan Gomez who covers immigration for USA Today Hi Allan Hi German and birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment which ah reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United\nThey reside so how could President Trump or undo that by executive order\nTo very good question um you know you just read the fourteenth amendment that was preceded by the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six and both of those were affirmed in Eighteen Ninety eight but as the U.S Supreme Court\nWho to throw in one more quote wrote the fundamental principles citizenship by birth within the dominion was reaffirmed the most explicit and comprehensive terms\nSo that's a pretty high legal hurdle to to climb when something is in law in the U.S constitution and upheld by the U.S Supreme Court but um there have been some conservative I'm sort of anti immigration groups in recent years who have seized on the phrasing that you said subject to the jurors to extend their of\n'em they're claiming that somebody who's an undocumented immigrant in this country is still a national of their home country they're claiming that people who come here um through birth tourism so a Chinese think of a Chinese national coming to the United states when they're pregnant giving birth here just so their child has\nUS citizenship and then returning back to China they're claiming those kinds of cases um do not fall within the fourteenth amendment um but as we've heard from those from the amendment\nAnd from the Supreme Court it's very very high legal hurdle to climb well\nThere are many who will look at this and say we're a week before the midterm elections and this is just a political move that he wants to excite his base even if he doesn't have any intention of actually doing this or he knows that it will go nowhere in the courts\nYeah the timing is incredible because it's not just this I mean you look at the fact that he has been hammering on the migrant care of and coming up through Mexico for weeks now I'm declaring it a national emergency and just this week that his administration announcing that they're going to send five thousand\nActive duty military troops down to the U.S border to stop them that's on top of already Twenty one hundred National Guards men that are down patrolling the border to stop what is now about thirty five hundred migrants um that are trying to make their way up\nI'm so there he's really seizing upon immigration I mean this was a strategy that worked for him obviously in twenty sixteen and when they're trying to combat what many are predicting will be this blue wave in this midterm election\nPartly to mostly Sunday's this afternoon with high temperatures today in the forties Italy partly cloudy tonight with low temperatures mid twenties to around thirty degrees tomorrow mostly sunny for most of the state mostly cloudy north of the lakes region was a chance some late afternoon rain showers their eyes tomorrow mid forties to lower fifty [noise] this is an H PR\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically a combination of not worth the feathers during\nWhich remember short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note until you're thirty two year treasury bond very moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with them about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian willed rich I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related to a structure of the company for example the so called rust belt\nWho's populated largely by industries which are very old Silicon Valley for example is a classic case of who who very new\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth um produce degrees or start a new ...\nThrew out per country and it depends obviously whether you're ... we're we're sorting process means something or wherever you're on the west coast through\n... through ... took stock prices were everyone talks about the only thing about this country which is very diverse artist depends where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge that this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future all we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity\nQuite well basically because\nFear you know when to deal with fear is very difficult to class for\nPerjury can you can look at the country\nIs basically a suppressed level of innovation under therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh just inclination to take risks in the book and suddenly I might add discussing whether the law of the long term outlook is all about\nOh we say that the issue the aging of the population\nAnd its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run\nThe reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that in title ... which are mandated by law\nOf gradually having an extra bleed driving out gross domestic savings and the economy dollar for dollar\nAnd so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners\nBut what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging right now the official actuaries of the Social Security system\nSay in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent\nIndefinitely into the future to do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFor civil rights I think it's going to happen I don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it could cause the debt overall the total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation\nWhen you say inflation it it it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about it for example\nInterest rates and ... century bc Greece when not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom are All right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we ship rates low as you point employment rate cell which is the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace\nThan the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties so the reason we did do move is that we didn't see that the signals were there and indeed\nThe unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation\nOf like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did\nIt change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo it is does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that into that and I\nThink that what we specifically learnt strangely for the first time in two thousand and it is there a tooth\nOne is that are toxic assets like a secure dies two mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and what may have financed by leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell I don't want to be a general you know that that was a very extraordinary period\nOrdinarily would have been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep rates down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said\nThat one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now\nI'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nFor jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that it's going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's it's not lower productivity\nBut it's an issue when you get to sort of tight labor market\nWage ... hours of necessity\nAnd it's the wage rate rises which\nAffect the cost of production and hence induced corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up that's where the problem is that has a really big on that\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talk about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nOr creative destruction is the process by which people do two things they continuously unrest but the investment is displacing\nOlder equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment and uh\nIt's to process which unfortunately is a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically as we pointed out in the book is the result of creative destruction\nWhich means essentially for

us through a week like this\nWere British ... is executive director with the Fred Rogers center she's with us from ... Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to grow hill when he got married\nUh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell they this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that ... ... ... the community that consumers are going to get very big in the community and scroll hill\nAnd um he loves walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various chemicals in synagogues and churches um that um made him feel at home um that bakeries that delicatessens [noise]\nHere yet is in Hebrew and a dozen other languages spoken as he walked down the street of that community\nYou actually learn uber didn't\nPay did yes well\nDo you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on squirrel hill\nI'm there to Mr Roger's neighborhood I think I'm certainly had\nSome of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighborhoods the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think with reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd probably I'll say the electrodes community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence or we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination\nThat word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers did and the puppet Daniel tiger\nThis question for lady ...\nFascination me [noise]\nHave you heard that word a lot today\nAnd I didn't know what it means [noise]\nWell [noise]\nIt means somebody getting killed in\nSort of surprised way what happened you know stand killed that other men\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now too many people are talking about it a lot of people are scared about it you know [noise]\nI'd rather talk about some other day when if you like [noise]\nThat sound or courtesy to Fred Rogers company ... lady overland goes on to change the subject to a ticket but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic\nOr she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in ...\nWell I think one of the things that he taught us all is that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grim naps where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about that and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses and everyone\nUm have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with that they identify with the helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen that line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers yes\n[noise] as part of that same\nFred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence levels and\nI've been terribly concerned about the graphic display of violence which the media has been showing recently\nAnd I clean for your protection and support of your young children\nThere is just so much that a very young child can say with out of me overwhelming\n[noise] what do you think for Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\n[noise] well I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message\nSo looking for the helpers helps uh see the good that is still around us\nFrank Rogers said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative ways\nWere British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified by what happened and and he would\nHe would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness\nI'm In ways that are not harmful to other people um and I you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods [noise] um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and\nNeighbor and the greater sense of the world that everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor\nUm and reach out and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds some all faiths of all races I'm so that we can live together

governor our former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties um and served with him\nOr so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed against a a filed a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea\nOf having protections for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAri let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let it out it's ... it's my turn an outrage and anger and they get out it's my time you're going to get a shot proud of it was like OK here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in ... last year and he stayed in the nation are if so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand\nAnd one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say um\nYou know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but ah you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for\nThem is that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or water people what's on their minds\nWhat seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions\nThere trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it what's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was\nRecent polling shows is that that it's you know very tight and ah we've got eight million voters or we do have in this election that can vote\nAnd um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they weren't the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November or will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal and Ohio\nIs a big deal it's always a big deal that Ohioans have approved at that ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have\nA a good good opportunity to get in there and help draw those lines and I have some effect on\nThat show Ingles who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you representatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing\nTo discuss what caused a seven thirty seven Macs a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning\nThe plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash\nJoining us now is ed Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially Going Radical you doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something\nMore than that something perhaps\nTo do with air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know is that the played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened you're my mind goes to\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil or back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nUh you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so a very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that health related flight\n... when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new are planted flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nAs it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on a brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max aid is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world of ...\nAmerican in southwest here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border and and you know of course this is also very rare for something like that so sure at this point you can ... you could construct all kinds of ah you know ideas about why this could have happened\nUh but you know the newness of an airplane in and of itself shouldn't cause something any more
