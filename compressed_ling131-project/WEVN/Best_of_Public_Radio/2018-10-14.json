academic officer for the public schools in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and a lot of kids in his schools were not reading well only fifty six percent of third graders were scoring proficient on the state reading test\nOr I didn't I didn't know what to do\nHe knew nothing about how kids learn to read or how reading should be taught but he did know that even some older students were struggling with pretty basic stuff when it came to reading\nI was in middle school and high school teacher for many years and I could see students who had difficulty with breaking down individual words\nThey come across a word they'd never seen before and have no idea how to sound it out Kim Harper noticed the same thing she was a high school English teacher in Bethlehem and she says a disturbing number of her students or not very good readers even students in honors classes\nThey didn't like to read they avoided reading they would tell me it was too hard\nShe didn't know what to do about it either so she kind of shrug it off\nI think it became easy to say well that's just the way it is and you're always going to have X percent of kids who is just going to be a a struggle for\nLess than sixty percent of kids reading professionally it wasn't shocking [noise] it's just the way things\nWere it was always was not a reflection of Bethlehem that's a portion of a\nMike ... is president of the Bethlehem school board\nWill you know those kids are parents aren't around or maybe they don't have to parents or one pair tomato a grandmother and that's the best way to do\nIt's true that the districts poorer schools had the worst reading scores there are lots of low income families here but there are a fancy homes here too and when she's academic officer jak sales I was examining the reading scores he saw there were plenty of kids at the wealthier schools not reading very well either this was not just poverty\nSince he knew nothing about reading he started searching online there's a whole lot of research about how kids learn to read there are thousands of studies\nIs Luis ... she's been teaching in researching reading since the Nineteen seventies this is the most states\nOne of the many things researchers have learned over the years is that virtually all kids can learn to read [noise] researchers have done studies in classrooms and clinics and they've shown over and over\nThat somewhere between one and six percent of kids have such severe learning disabilities that they will probably always struggle with reading but everyone else can learn to read if they are taught [noise]\nThe problem is lots of kids aren't being taught at least not in ways that line up with what science says about how children learn to read the result\nMore than six intend fourth graders in the United states are not proficient readers thirty million adults struggle to read a basic passage of text and this is not just a poverty problem one third of struggling readers are from college educated families\nIn [noise]\nFrom a PM reports this is hard words why aren't are kids being taught to read kids who struggled to read are more likely to drop out of high school they're more likely to end up in the criminal justice system they're more likely\nTo live in poverty when they grow up [noise] but we shouldn't have so many struggling readers over the coming our we're going to find out why we're going to learn what typical reading instruction in American schools is like and why it's wrong [noise]\nBut in fact that's not what good readers do studies that compare skilled readers to pour readers show that poor readers gas when they come to a word they don't know because\nWhen skilled readers come to a war they don't know they rapidly identified the sounds and letters in the word good readers may guess at the meaning of the word but they don't guess at the print on the page [noise]\nWe're going back to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania now where balance literacy was the prevailing approach to reading instructions until the district got serious about trying to do something about all those kids who are struggling\nWith reading point [noise]\nThis is Cathy best she's walking the halls of calypso elementary where she's the principal\nBack in twenty Fifteen when Bethlehem realized it needed to change the way it taught reading district leaders decided the first step would be a series of trainings for all the principles at the district sixteen elementary schools over the course of an entire school year the principles we're going to be taught the reading science\nAs it happened Kathy bass was out on medical leave when the trainings began butter colleagues warned her\nThey said to me Cathy we know you you're not going to take well to this training\nThe principles we're learning about the importance of explicitly teaching children how to decode words and everyone was sure Kathy bass was going to resist\nThey knew who I was and how reading with a passion and the decoding was never part of anything I ever did but ... had a secret\n[noise] even though she was known as the districts number one balanced literacy champion\nShe had that before becoming a principal Kathy bad to bend a reading specialist it was her job to help struggling readers\nIn her training to become a reading specialist she says she learned a lot about how to identify a child with a reading problem but she learned nothing about how to help a child actually learn to read I didn't know what to do\nExcept to give them more books\nAnd it wasn't working with time on our hands while she was on medical leave\nThe bass to begin reading about reading and she discovered the vast scientific literature when she returned to work for medical even joined her fellow principles and the trainings on the reading science she was ready to hear what the trainer had to say and it kind of blew her mind\nWhile we do okay\nLet's go get at this\nThe training of principles we're doing used curriculum written by Lewis the most you heard her earlier the curriculum is called language essential for teachers of reading and spelling or letters for short\nThe principles went through the training and twenty Fifteen the kindergarten teachers went through it the next year than the districts first and second grade teachers did the training I got to sit in on it for part of the day was\nThe training was led by Mary Jo ... she's an educational consultant which word doesn't begin with the same sound\nFor children's it clearly understand how letters represent speech sounds they need to be able to hear the speech sounds and teachers do too it's not always easy to tell me the first sound you hear in unit [noise]\nYes before you get to the ... how about Charlotte [noise]\n\nOnce kids can isolate the sounds in a word there next task is to understand how letters represent those sounds in English we have forty four different speech sounds or phonemes each phone him is represented by a letter or combinations of letters\nResearch shows when kids are explicitly taught how letters represent phonemes they become better readers\nBut phonics isn't enough [noise] kids can learn to decode words without knowing what the words mean to comprehend what they're reading kids need a good vocabulary too\nSupport for any ... live stream comes from you our listeners and from conquered regional

window into what's going on in a child's brain when they're learning how to read with our sound [noise]\nThat's being now what's the next sound [noise]\nAre how do you make our\nQuinn struggles for a moment but get some help from Mrs annabelle\nHow do you make the sound are where you're pirate pat you are or how do you how do you write are [noise]\nWith a little more prompting queen eventually get are absolutely Lynn ... has been teaching elementary\nSchool for Twenty one years\nShe says she used to think reading would just kind of fall together for kids if they were exposed to enough print now because of the science of reading training she knows better she says this year's class of kindergartners has progressed more quickly and reading than any class she's ever had\nMy kids are successful and happy and believe in themselves I don't have a single child in my room that has that look on their face like I Can't do this\nCurrently can you tell me what your cat is going to do\n\nRight that is a wonderful list of things that your cat can do\nIt was extraordinary because even though states have the authority to regulate teacher preparation programs\nThey rarely tell them what to teach in their classes\nHigher education does not like to be told what to do this is Kelly Butler again\nProfessors pretty much had academic freedom to construct learning in the way they think best\nFaculty members close the door and do whatever the heck they will too\nThat's Angela Rutherford she is a faculty member at the University of Mississippi she works with the bar still reading Institute she knows the reading science and she says a lot of her colleagues and teacher preparation programs don't they believe in whole language\nThat's what they believe I had a colleague challenge me and her question was well you know what do you believe I said I Believe what I see and research\nOnce when Kelly Butler was talking to a dean about the reading science the deans said to her is this your science or my science is this your science or my science\n[noise] that's what Kelly Butler and her colleagues were up against they want it to change what prospective teachers in Mississippi were learning about reading state officials did too but Kelly Butler says many deans and faculty still believed in whole language well\nFast forward to twenty Fifteen and we now have illiteracy dies promotion at\nThe state legislature had passed a law called the literacy based promotion act the law says that kids who are not reading on grade level by the end of third grade cannot move on to fourth grade\nWhat that precipitated was retraining of teachers because we knew that teachers really didn't know enough about what to do\nThe teachers already working in Mississippi schools started learning the reading science but what about the new teachers just graduating from teacher prep program if they weren't learning the science the state would be spending money forever training teachers\nAt this point no one really knew what aspiring teachers were actually learning in those required early literacy classes\nSo and twenty Fifteen the bark still reading Institute decided to repeat this study had done back in two thousand three this time private colleges were included Fifteen teacher prep programs over all\nThe new news sun Kelly Butler says with one exception [noise] all the states teacher prep programs for\nNow teaching the five components of reading the deans and faculty all said they'd heard of the national reading panel report but most of them had not read it she learned to other things that shocked her\nWhen I interviewed both faculty and students and asked them particular questions about the science of reading for example were they familiar with something called the simple view of reading\nThat that formula scientists came up with to explain that reading comprehension is a product of your ability to decode taxed times all the words you know the meaning of\nNot a single one that I don't do it ever heard of the simplicity of reading which has been around since Nineteen eighty six [noise]\nScience had been around for a long time\nState had been requiring colleges to teach the science for more than a decade and still prospective teachers weren't learning it [noise]\nSo the state legislature decided to do something else [noise] it started requiring teacher candidates to pass a test on the reading science if you don't pass the foundations of reading test you don't get licensed\nYeah\nWere backing letters training with the college faculty and Mississippi there in Paris now working on Sunday Mick awareness skills this is ... hairs Alan ... and you heard them earlier\nWhat is the beach\n[laughter]\nCollege faculty in Mississippi are not required to do letters training but it's in the best interest of those who teach the early literacy classes since their students will not become license teachers unless they pass the foundations of reading test\nI interviewed several of the women in this training there were all women I was expecting to hear resistance and resignation about being here but I didn't\nAs I'm sitting in there I'm thinking I'm gonna do this and classics weaker oh man I Wish I'd done I don't have to make a note you know to do this next semester\nThat was Kim Smith of Mississippi State and this is Barbara Bolling of the University of southern Mississippi\nI feel blessed to be part of this change\nThey were elementary school teachers before they became college instructors they didn't know the reading science when they were teachers and they're grateful to be learning it now\nI think that we all agree that that this is right\nThe best practices and maybe we're here because of that and the whole language ones are not here because I think they would earlier resists\nThe faculty who believe in whole language didn't seem to be here I had to look for them I found two professors at the University of southern Mississippi willing to talk to me ah\nMy name is Stacy read and an associate professor of literacy and other areas of elementary ed\nI'm Mary aerial I'm a professor or in the department of curriculum instruction special education\nMary aerial had actually been the chair of the department until a few months before our interview she and Stacey reads both told me they had no interest in going to the letters training this is Stacey reads\nI Am philosophically opposed to jumping on the bandwagon of the next great thing that's going to teach every child has learned to read phonics for me is not that answer\nShe says she knows this from her own experience she was in elementary school teacher before she got her PHD it was the early Nineteen nineties her students did phonics worksheets and then got these little books called ... readers that contained words with the letter patterns they'd been practicing\nSentences like the bad rat hit and the tin can\nThey were boring repetitive that as soon as I sat down with my first graders and read a book like fraud into their friends they were instantly engaged in story\nShe says she ditched the phonics work books and the Dakota will readers and once I started\nTeaching in a more whole way more encompassing way of the whole child what does this child and eat what does that child need let's read more real\nBullets Whistler right more real language about your life once they did that my teaching improve the students learn more I feel I feel they came out the other side much better\nStacy ... says her students seemed more engaged but she admits she had no evidence they were learning better [noise]\nOne of the central tenets of the whole language movement is that teachers are best able to judge whether their students are learning not standardized\nAnother key idea is that all children learn differently and need to be taught in different ways but that's\nOur brains are much more similar than they are different and we all need to learn the same things to change our non reading brains into reading brains some of us learned to read more quickly and easily than others but every one reads in basically the same way\nOne of the most consistent findings in all of education research is that children become better readers when they get explicit and systematic phonics instruction\nDakota will readers would let her patterns maybe boring and repetitive for adults but they help children learn to read\nMary aerial the former chair of the curriculum and special ed department at the University of southern Mississippi remains unconvinced she's against explicit phonics instruction\nShe thinks it can be helpful to do some phonics with kids as they're reading books maybe prompt them to sound something out to notice a letter pattern in a word but she thinks kids will be distracted from understanding the meaning of what they're reading if teachers focus too much on how words are made up of letters\nWhat it really does it makes it harder because we are trying to make meaning of it and when you you're teaching these meaningless symbol\nThan it is actually making it harder for breaking it down into pieces makes it ... makes it harder to learn to read a that's the idea that one of the the ideas of concepts behind whole language is that it's that's when it's meaningful it's easy and when is broken down into little parts and makes it harder\nSo okay so so from your perspective how do kids learn to read [noise]\nWell I think kids learn to read in different ways um a lot of children come to school already reading because they had been immersed in print rich environments from the time they were born\nThe underlying belief here is the reading comes naturally when children are read to end surrounded by books [noise]\nMary aerial sees the effort to change reading instruction in Mississippi as an example of lawmakers telling educators what to do and she doesn't like it she actually left her job shortly after our interview in part because of her frustration over what's happening with reading and Mississippi she told me she does not like the term science\nOf reading that is one of the bones of contention that a phonics based approach is the scientific approach and it's it's their science", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Best of Public Radio", "city": "Keene", "day": "14"}
