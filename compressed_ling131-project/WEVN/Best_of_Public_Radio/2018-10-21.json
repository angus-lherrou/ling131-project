research on how male supremacy started Ken how men have held onto our dominant position for so long\nWith an emphasis on how it all went down in the western world and in the United states [noise]\nMost of the recent headlines on the toxic masculinity beat have come from the me too movement to blue open\nIn October twenty Seventeen with the Harvey Weinstein allegations about and so I moved on her like a bitch I couldn't get there and she was ... may have been let a year earlier and when you're a star they listen to it and do anything\nWith it of course women have been talking

nearly impossible to deny the pervasive ... of sexual harassment and abuse it's not only men who do it but it's overwhelmingly men\nWomen feel when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men were\nHistorically were the nothing\nThat in the attack when asked him was quickly linked to an online community of trolls and violent massage in is that call themselves in

you can't just be an ordinary man or an ordinary woman you have to be as somebody else\n\nSo Celeste there's a pretty broad consensus among scholars that the invention of agriculture and of more subtle specialized societies and created\nAn opportunity for men they pushed for these more distinct gender roles and sees for themselves the rules that carry most of the power especially political and economic power\nBut before we leave deep time I had one more question from Meg cocky and milk Connor and that was why did the patriarchy happen\nYou mean what was the motive why did the men of ten thousand years ago [noise] want to see in the upper hand at the expense of the women in their lives yeah I mean what a jerk move catch a jerk move you all have been making ever since ...\nAnd here's how ... answer the why question\nSome people will argue that men need to tell themselves or want to be in charge because they are left out of the whole reproductive process really in terms of being the one\nThat can create life and uh even if people are informed that it can't happen without their sperm nonetheless it's a huge cultural difference is in many societies the creation and perpetuation of life is a really big deal right\nSo guys have insecure egos well and they cause of what it was amazing thing that women can do that they can't do that and we can do and then that makes us want to run for Congress that [laughter]\nRight and then you can think you can control women's bodies by you know endorsing anti abortion laws anyway I'm\nMargaret Mead came up with this concept of whom envy as an answer to that to Fred's concept of pain and suffering from much better concept his ambition to predict which to me\n[noise]\nBut even though Mel Conner thanks womb envy is real he says there's the simple reason men built the gender hierarchy and put themselves in the top spot\nThe most basic explanation for why you know supremacy appeared after\nHe writes about torture falls in control who I Am as well as personal [noise] because they're good\nAnd so it's about power really write\nThat scholars say after patriarchy developed with the first societies to settle down and farm those cultures became the first colonial powers and they spread systems of patriarchy to the places they count I\nHave a question though about this room and the idea in our society today\nI don't really see a lot of reverence for motherhood or fatherhood for that matter the U.S is practically alone among rich countries and not guaranteeing paid parental leave or help with early childcare we'll pay childcare workers a living wage\nThere are rampant reports of pregnancy discrimination women not getting jobs worth losing them because they got pregnant\nAnd really even in terms of attitudes\nDo you really think the typical man in our society is an author of women's ability to give birth or do you most guys kind of see it as mundane no big deal something you're quite happy to leave to women\nNo I I I take your point I I don't think our society socialize as us to truly whole motherhood in high esteem except on Mother's Day gift that\nSupport for any ... life's dream comes from you our listeners

listening to the making of male dominance from the scene on radio podcast NPR acts\nOn junkie when and I'm Celeste Headlee and this special we're looking at the history of patriarchy where it came from in the first place and why it's lasted so long\nSo I'm ... what do you want to know about so one section is gender and science this section as colonial science a\nProfessor ... of Stanford University is showing our producer her library at her home in the bay area eventually she gets to a frame to document on the wall says this is the\nPage from Maria ... diary this is the comment that she discovered the photocopy page represents shaping our own important discovery early in her career as an historian she found a page in Paris in the astronomical new books of a German couple\nI Do not believe that this woman he's fun to see\nIn the sciences itchy ... system like all alone and just follow most of all time job so since the best ... she knows how to handle mom just called in and for them to school\nBut eventually after two years the academy decides that if\nA woman was there is drawing them or people would laugh and this is actually\nWhat they say and they were a young academy at the time Paris was where the scientific action was not in Berlin they were looking for state isn't prestige and they were worried that a woman would destroy that status and prestige so they deny her\nAnd I see this as a door slamming shut and for women is Maria ... had been the astronomer of the academy in Seventeen ten it may have been that women would have followed that this would have opened the door to the regular participation of women in astronomy\n\nSalon she says in her research she found it in the early Seventeen hundreds about ten percent of astronomers in Germany were women\nAlmost three hundred years later when she was writing your book and the percentage was lower\nThat is incredible looking back we might think it was inevitable of course Murray of income on didn't get that job of course male dominance would prevail for several more centuries it seemed like a given because we know the end of that story right but she seems to be saying he could have gone the other way\nYeah what happened to Maria ... on just looks like a power play by the man in charge of the Berlin academy right she deserves the job she was already in the job and in fact a few years after rejecting her for the position\nThey gave it to her son was Maria as her son's quote unquote assistant justice she'd been her husband's assistance\nSo the academy retain her services anyway as one of their inhouse stronger or they just weren't\nGoing to give the title to a woman just because that just was not done right but that kind of blatant exclusion was potentially going to get more problematic as you moved further into the Seventeen hundreds and enlightenment ideas really took hold\nRight for many centuries it had been enough to say that women are subordinate to men based on the theory of humorous or on interpretations of the Bible but by the Seventeen hundreds those notions just weren't holding up anymore and societies newly interested in actual evidence\nAnd not only that this was the enlightenment and people were embracing the idea that all people were born with God given in alien ... writes an Englishman John locks formulation in the sixteen hundreds we all have a natural right to life liberty and property\nThese ideas we're creating new complications for the racist and sexist societies on both sides of the Atlantic says ... dinner\nIf you wanted to not give rights to women or two African slaves or to others in the society you had to\nExplain from nature why they are not equal so mad at me so the study of the female and the mail\nOkay so John tell us more and then we'll talk on the other side\nOr at sea assume ... says what plays out in the mid seventies hundreds is what she calls a war over skeletons\nScientific illustrators were making the first detailed drawing a female skeletons and even though this was supposed to be pure science the drawings were politically loaded\nThe two that became the most influential were drawn by a German man Sammy ... than a French woman Genevieve dark and the\nAnd the story isn't going to go the way you might expect\nShe says both drawings had problems but the one by the French woman was the more success to the to\nThe German man portrays the female skull as large the French woman portrays the female skull as smaller\nAnd she portrays the past as very very large and roomy very large in proportion to the rest of the body and it was just go in the pelvis that became the sights of political debate\nTo make this clear Madame ... didn't just happen to choose a model skeleton with a smallish head and abroad pelvis her drawing was out of proportion with any normal woman\nWomen skulls are slightly larger than men in proportion to the rest of the body but in her drawing darken veal made the woman's head unnaturally small at her pelvis very big even though women's palaces or no broader than men's\nShe says Thomas ... drawing was more accurate but Genevieve ... became the more popular image of the female anatomy the one most adopted by doctors and medical schools maybe because it's squared with an emerging narrative about gender differences\nThe new anatomy he is a scientific foundation to the exclusion of women and on top of that is layered a lot of ideology\nAnd instead of if you take liberal philosophy that men and women should be equal\nThere was developed this theory of complement charity and that's the idea that men and women complement each other they aren't the equals of each other but they are the natural complement and this again shows that men should belong to the public sphere\nOf science and the professions and the state and women should\nBelong to the private sphere of the home and children of the loving and nurturing private life [noise]\nThis appeal to anatomy and help the patriarchal thinkers when their argument over the egalitarian that argument was real even though in a male dominated society and the battle took place mostly among men used the Johns Hopkins historian Toby deeds again\nThere is constant ... bay Condit didn't push back and I didn't ... even though what you're seeing is a certain\nKind of stability and continuity it takes enormous labor to keep reproducing that and they're always they're always moments when things went differently could have gone differently and then there's backlash\nLike Mary Wellstone craft called for women's rights in the late Eighteen century but before her there were prominent men\n... who we heard from the top of the episode and then other leading enlightenment thinkers like boo fall quarter say lock in life and it's all argued with varying degrees of passion for the equality of this\nMen are often wonderful feminist\nOn the other side where men like Emmanuel conned Francis Bacon and maybe the most pivotal thinker on the woman question John Jacques Russo\nWriting in the seventeenth sixties Russo appeal to the supposed anatomical differences between men and women women's smaller brains and bigger palaces to back his theory of complement parity\nWomen are less inherently valuable than men that would have gone against Russo as liberal ideals instead he said women were just fundamentally different but different in ways that proved nature designed women to serve men\nThe woman's ... education should be done in relation to men two policemen to be useful to them to win the love and respect to raise them as children care for them as adults\nVisa women's duties in all the Jews and visa ... should be taught from childhood\nSo Toby Dietz says complementary and he becomes the new justification for excluding women from lots of things but especially from the halls of political and economic power\nAnd you begin to say well she's not as rational maybe say that you draw on that stream\nOf discouraged she's rational but not as rational\nShe is disqualified on the basis of her physiology you know female physiology she's disqualified because of our higher maternal duties you all of a sudden get new ways of defining difference between men and women\nThat would work better to justify\nExclusion from equal citizenship equal citizenship on both sides of the Atlantic before the American revolution only some men only some white men got full citizenship rights\nOr he might be a middling family farmer he might be a um a gentleman plantation owner\nBut he owns property and in virtue of the ownership of property that he also has the authority over a wide range of household dependence so that there's this bright line between the independent\nHead of household and has dependents in those dependence are everyone from his wife and children to his free white servants and is in slave D a servants both men and women", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Best of Public
