six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the past\nBecause I don't know I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt\nThat I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that it seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either\nHave to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group and there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you\nDid you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity how did that take shape\nShort it was after the twenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not\nEvil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there is another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more\nCompassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more because I I had thought before that I'd been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those\nShape how you're thinking about politics or the election it's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump's\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your about your evolution\nI have been avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job\nThen you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all the focus my optimism\nElectric ruin thank you so much for talking with us I think you know ... ... this is NPR News\nI'm ended up from Barrington turned her mini Cooper in the MORNING EDITION regularly with David Greene students Vicki from Hudson turned her Audi into the news\nThe American Medical Association\nAnd Greg from Dover turned his Porsche ...

constitution or be at some statutory law within the state\nAs things currently stand the doctrine is that merely being a tax payer and seeing your government spend money in what you believe to be an illegal way is not enough of an injury for you to be able to go to court and asserts standing to bring a lawsuit\nThis amendment if adopted would expand the capacity of of the courts to really oversee the elected branches with respect to decisions they make with public funds what was the origin of this\nWell there was a case a few years ago involving state tax credits it was a lawsuit that was brought to challenge the adoption of a state tax credit scheme which permitted\nNew Hampshire businesses which made contributions to scholarship funds and those scholarship funds were then used to fund scholarships to private schools including parochial schools so there was a lawsuit brought\nClaiming that that violated the separation of church and state in a couple of different provisions of the New Hampshire state constitution and it was brought pursuant to a statute that is very soon\nStatute that was adopted a few years earlier and that statue was adopted in response to an earlier Supreme Court decision\nBut the statute invited lawsuits by taxpayers to challenge what they believe to be unlawful expenditures of funds the New Hampshire Supreme Court to the surprise of many in the case decided not to address the underlying constitutional issue the separation of church and state issue because they decided that\nThis New Hampshire statue was unconstitutional and in doing so they followed federal law because under federal law and under the federal constitution\nBeing a tax payer is not enough to allow one to bring a lot of doesn't reach a minimum thresholds standard that's right the threshold has been that you have to have a personal stake in this that's right some sort of actual individualized injury\nOr some of the group supporting an opposing this member I Know your supporters saying this was a thing historically opponents are concerned that listen this is going to bring frivolous lawsuits we're going to be\nClogging the courts here yeah I mean it is going to invite lawsuits where law suits were previously not possible I don't have a deep understanding of of the politics of this but I Do know that there is support\nFor this on both sides I Know that for example bill Duncan who was the plaintiff in the case a few years ago seeking to bring a constitutional challenge to the New Hampshire tax credit scheme\nIs for this as are some more conservative elements within state politics is an interesting bipartisan group of supporters yeah yeah it's really a referendum on our separation of powers and it's really an expression\nOf a desire to involve the judiciary more robustly in terms of overseeing expenditures of funds by the democratically accountable branches\nTheoretically what do you worry a little bit about that well I mean I think different people have different ideas in different baseline understandings of how we work best in terms of ah when the judiciary should become involved and things like this there are people who think that the judiciary is more insulated from politics and can stand more on principle\nAnd they tend to favor more robust involvement of the judiciary in protecting rights particularly in situations where the underlying question is whether or not some expenditure of funds is consistent with our constitution there are those though who are concerned about judicial involvement\nOr who think that this is better left to the political branches that don't legislate from the bench that's right\nSo when this time that there is a lot of concern nationally about judges becoming more part is and I do believe this amendment could contribute to that in any way when\nThe state Supreme Court held that the statute allowing taxpayer suits of this sort of was unconstitutional\nOn the surface what the judiciary seemed to be doing was giving up power it saying we can't be involved in this\nBut sometimes we talk about this and constitutional all the time sometimes the best way to preserve one's power to preserve one's cachet in one's reputation is to not get involved right\nAnd so this is taking a way from the judiciary a tool in their tool kit because it is going to necessarily require them to reach the merits of some perhaps hot button political issues\nThat they just stay on the sidelines for and so it'll be interesting to see if this amendment were to pass it would perhaps force the court to decide some issues where\nUnder current law it would otherwise decide that it just doesn't have the power to decide\nWell if this does pass would this be a shock to the court system are we going to see you know a bone of of cases and\nWell it's interesting I mean as you said before this is how the law was for a long time and you know the court system was not\nOvercome with these sorts of lawsuits but things have changed I mean politics partisanship has changed another thing that's changed is the obligation of the Supreme Court in this state now to take all appeals that used to exercise discretion with respect to what case\nNow under current law there is a right to appeal to the state Supreme Court so it may end up not only leading to some cases in the lower courts better in a different kind of more political than we otherwise obscene but it may it may force more of those cases to the New Hampshire Supreme Court as well\nThat was ... professor John Gray be talking about the first question on the ballot next week that would have meant that the state constitution you can tune it to MORNING EDITION tomorrow to hear him explain how the second question could affect ...

flipping cameras around for selfies and then recording videos that would fit perfectly and the ten seconds Snapchat\nOr do they want to go through\nThese things politicians need to be pretty good at while pretending that they're not here in New Hampshire campaigning for president already and bookers definitely in that camp his name is among those on the growing list of Democrats who might challenge Trump's been twenty twenty\nAnd other skill that's called needs to master is how they'll answer the inevitable question so are you running or what in Hanover Booker first went with\nThe dog

conquered\nLast year because Mali Kelly to be the next governor of New Hampshire\nAnd then there are people like former San Antonio mayor who Castro who brought up the topic on his own no question

about the quality she'll be looking for in a candidate when the time\nI Am hoping for someone who can be a good leader them with good moral character and tell the truth\nWell most of the action around twenty twenty is happening in New Hampshire is democratic circles some Republicans do have their eyes on the primary to former Ohio governor John ... is considering taking on the president and he'll be giving a speech in Manchester a week after the midterms\nWell these candidates might not be making their official announcements anytime soon the midterm elections will be a helpful barometer for

P. R. ... voters will have the opportunity to decide next week whether the past two amendments to the state constitution in the form of questions on the ballot\nThe first would change taxpayer standing to bring legal actions against the government UH law professor John ... joins us in the studio to explain what this change would mean for the state's court system morning John\nGood morning right so I was trying to break the sound a little bit what would this question on the ballot in November ...\nWell if it were adopted it would permit the tax payer of any district within the state\nTo bring a lawsuit if they believe that the government unit that they'd be suing is spending money in violation of law be at the constitution or be at some statutory law within the state\nAs things currently stand the doctrine is that merely being a taxpayer and seeing your government spend money in what you believe to be an illegal way is not enough of an injury for you to be able to go to court and asserts standing to bring a lot\nAnd if if adopted would expand the capacity of of the courts to really oversee the elected branches with respect to decisions they make with public funds what was the origin of this\nWell there was a case a few years ago involving state tax credits it was a lawsuit was brought to challenge the adoption of a state tax credits scheme which permitted New Hampshire businesses which made contributions to scholarship funds and those scholarship funds\nWere then used to fund scholarships to private schools including parochial school so it was a lawsuit brought\nClaiming that that violated the separation of church and state in a couple of different provisions of the New Hampshire state constitution and it was brought pursuant to a statute that is very similar\nTo the amendment that's proposed a statute that was adopted a few years earlier and that statue was adopted in response to an earlier Supreme Court decision\nBut the statute invited lawsuits by taxpayers to challenge what they believe to be unlawful expenditures of funds the New Hampshire Supreme Court to the surprise of many in the case decided not to address the underlying constitutional issue the separation of church and state issue because they decided that\nThis New Hampshire statute was unconstitutional and in doing so they followed federal law because under federal law and under the federal constitution being a tax payer is not enough to allow one to bring a lawsuit doesn't reach a minimum thresholds standard that's right the threshold has been that you have to have a personal stake in this that's right some sort of actual individualized\n... who are some of the group supporting an opposing to some member I Know your supporters saying this was a thing historically opponents are concerned that listen this is going to bring frivolous lawsuits we're going to be\nClogging the courts here yeah I mean it is going to invite lawsuits where law suits were previously not possible I don't have a deep understanding of of the politics of this but I Do know that there is support\nFor this on both sides I Know that for example bill Duncan who was the plaintiff in the case a few years ago seeking to bring a constitutional challenge to the New Hampshire tax credit scheme\nIs for this as are some more conservative elements within state politics is an interesting bipartisan group of supporters yeah yeah it's really a referendum on our separation of powers and it's really an expression\nOf a desire to involve the judiciary more robustly in terms of overseeing expenditures of funds by the democratically accountable branches\nTheoretically what do you worry a little bit about that well I mean I think different people have different ideas in different baseline understandings of how we work best in terms of\nAh when the judiciary should become involved and things like this there are people who think that the judiciary is more insulated from politics and can stand more on principle\nAnd they tend to favor more robust involvement of the judiciary in protecting rights particularly in situations where the underlying question is whether or not some expenditure of funds is consistent with our constitution\nThere are those though who are concerned about judicial involvement or who think that this is better left to the political branches\nThat don't legislate from the bench that's right so when this time that there is a lot of concern nationally about judges becoming more part ascended ... believe this amendment could contribute to that in any way when\nThe state Supreme Court held that the statute allowing taxpayer suits of this sort of was unconstitutional on the surface what the judiciary seemed to be doing was giving up power it saying we can't be involved in this\nBut sometimes we talk about this and constitutional all the time\nSometimes the best way to preserve one's power to preserve one's cachet in one's reputation is to not get involved right and so this is taking a way from the judiciary a tool in their tool kit because it is going to necessarily require them to reach the merits of some\nThat they just have to stay on the sidelines for and so it'll be interesting to see if this amendment where to pass it would perhaps force the court to decide some issues where\nCurrent law it would otherwise decide that it just doesn't have the power to decide\nWell if this does pass would this be a shock to the court system are we going to see you know a bone of of cases and\nWell it's interesting I mean as you said before this is how the law was for a long time and you know the court system was not\nOvercome with these sorts of lawsuits but things have changed I mean politics partisanship has changed\nAnother thing that's changed is the obligation of the Supreme Court in this state now to take all appeal it used to exercise discretion with respect to what cases it took and so now under current law there is a right to appeal to the state Supreme Court so it may end up not only\nLeading to some cases in the lower courts that are different in kind and more political than we otherwise obscene but it may it may force more of those cases to the New Hampshire Supreme Court as well\nAnd it was a law professor John Gray be talking about the first question on the ballot next
