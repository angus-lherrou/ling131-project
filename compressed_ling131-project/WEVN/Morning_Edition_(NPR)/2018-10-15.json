change the way you think last year was one of the deadliest flu seasons in decades an estimated eighty thousand Americans died and thirty nine year old St Louis Mandel is almost one of them\nNow he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCurrently hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not to somebody who's healthy and in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nI Know you've got a message to the other day or having grown up and running out and and that was\nStill I Would call but by and large sums of improved soldier was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in here do you knew he had the flu actually his wife had it too but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause Oregon's to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors were worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat\nI basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this\nFrom the flu it's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people the complications from the flu a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy\nIt can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in\nAnd that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know they got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still nine at him\nI was lying awake at night I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so uh I took to Twitter to

happening at particular intersections our people fracturing schools or sprained ankles or are some types of scooters more dangerous than others\nSo you have to look at the patterns to see where the

time we're seeing a rise in injuries but we also see that people are getting out of their car and potentially helping to relieve congestion you know is that a trade off from a public agency standpoint but we think is a good one I don't know we don't know yet\nPortland of course does not want to rise and injuries they're handing out free helmets and doing a public education campaign\nBut you only have to look at the ... going by to see that this is a big change Carson scooters are still learning how to be around each other and not many people are wearing helmets cities and physicians will get

is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales or ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it

Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry sent dirty in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and the homeless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described your product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest sources of the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show\nThat comes to shove filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon about a hundred twenty six countries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr if if the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales while\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ...\nThe store to the sealer but yes they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global market has really

the twenty five percent tax increase tests were taxes no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different\nWays out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid we obviously is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that has um [noise]\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nUh [noise] I think we all understand there are no winners or trade war and we're we didn't have for this issue\nWe're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much uh come up as an issue you made an issue like an election\nYeah it has to come up I mean Congress\nAnd bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with\nA vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in in he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen sixty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four Congress passed a resolution declaring bourbon being indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith bourbon you've got to make it here in America and if he wants to sell you better make the\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from a fight standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back\nTo drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people far industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations spirit\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit\nImpassable rather than non functional phones and made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster is\nJust a ... mile cross\nColony networks and the fried division of tower hill a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor a situation like that we're relying on the side of it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas for the last generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and caught industry is just devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster without that insurance and Alabama he's been working in Houston county\n... debate it last week and uh\nJust blows it away but last April source of income\nUs our livelihood early estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do that in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so we had some good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now the communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler and Alabama says the damage is upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because look if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause she's eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election is we're dedicated electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding goal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News and you're listening to an age beyond New Hampshire's tight housing market many younger families face tough competition when it comes to buying their first home coming up reporter Robert rubber follows one couple they tried to buy a house\nPart of our series and the costs and benefits of settling down immigrant's day\nStory next on an HBO\nOr today and exchanges housing tourism and ... in New Hampshire this on line properly mental service has taken off recently lost during a new way traveling lodging and making a\nCash but complaints have risen to housing noise taxes and more we look at these impact on local property market neighborhoods and tourism email us exchanges any the yard\nAnd again at seven pm on any beyond [noise]\nSupport for an H.
