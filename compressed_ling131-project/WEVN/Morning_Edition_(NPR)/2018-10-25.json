comes to our immigration system to suggest to somehow the country is not welcoming I think it's disingenuous we're very welcoming nation\nBut you can't come here legally so we have to make shows acute a border I think that's fair to those who are seeking to come here and it's also fair to the American worker\nNew Hampshire seen an increase in the presence of a federal and ice officials with a regular check points along I Ninety three engine popular tourist areas of taking especially in Lincoln over the summer and holiday weekends do you believe those checkpoints of are effective or the ...\nThink if I were securing the border right that that's what ISIS they're forced to secure our border so that they're doing border enforcement border security and make sense to me what doesn't make sense to me is the amount of authority they have to write their own rules and determine how that enforcement should be done and carried out that's more of a challenge that's more of a problem with me\nBecause of the their their independent of state role\nNot just that I'm troubled by any authority given to the ministry of agencies to write their own rules and enforce those rules in Jesuit journals that's more troubling to me because as you know Nineteen forty six I Believe Congress transfer a lot of his rulemaking authority\nTo administrative agencies and that's what you see here that the more challenging standpoint is that I think they may just self determination that the borders stands a hundred miles away from the border that's more concerning that that's that's something that elected officials should be engaged in on behalf of their citizens that constituents\nSo that that the notion that a a federal agency and I'm very supportive of our law enforcement and I'm very supportive of securing the border very supportive ice but also I'm supportive uh uh the structure of government and when it comes to rule making and laws being crafted that should be done by the legislature not by the ministry of agency\nLet's turn our attention if we could add to trade for a minute that the Trump Administration worked with Canada and Mexico to revise NAFTA it's been renamed the United states Mexico Canada agreement some arguing it it doesn't really change all that much there has been some movement with the dairy industry here in America being able to sell it to Canada now what's your take on that well\nI think when we see the full details of this agreement then I'll I'll be in a better position to make that assessment but the fact that this deal was renegotiated in Canada is is that\nTells me a great deal changes occurred and that's how people are categorized and now that not a lot of change but I I think the fact that we we got a deal on a table and people thought we wouldn't be able to renegotiate NAFTA we wouldn't be able to to do this but that's more of the\nPolicy bickering that goes on in D.C as as opposed to the overall approach of the overall approach he has to make sure the Americans being treated fairly in our trade deals\nAnd that's I think you ... you saw that with you and I think he thought I Would now and I think you're optimally will see that with China\nWell if you brought up China that's interesting because of course some businesses here in the Granite State say look you know it this is costing us money the president's position has been looked there might be some short term pain here but this is for of fairness in the long term what's your feeling on\nShort you know wind up pledges I've had campaigning for instance a pro two thousand Seventeen is is the ability to to meet so many different wonderful people\nAnd I met a number of manufacturers in our state business folks in our state\nWho are concerned about this and many of them of also said to me though at least the conversations I've had that they're willing to give the president some level forbearance here because they understand the ultimate goal here is to make sure that we have balance and we've been treated fairly and and some of these trade deals how much leeway do you think they're willing to give [noise]\nWell I think according to some of these folks they understand the long term ramifications rather than the short term outcomes but they're looking at this down the road because\nSome of these businesses or a fourth third generation businesses\nSo they understand the dynamic started taking place was the understanding the business you're looking at the long term viability of of your industry\nOr to talk to you about possible sanctions and with Saudi Arabia since the alleged murder of ... by by the Saudi Government there have been talks from Congress and others of course about us sanctions against Saudi Arabia would would you support sanctions\nI I think one of the first things you you you learn as a a law enforcement officer you got to get all the facts before you make a decision you have to as is critical ... and so I I think right now\nWe should let the facts gathers gather the facts what we do know is that it was a very hands murder committed and we should be addressing that investigating and determine who actually carrying out this murder making sure they held accountable make sure they brought forward and if a Saudi Arabia is a ... directly involved they had knowledge of it they they coordinated and

R.\nAnd joining me now to discuss it as Josh Rogers who was there asking some questions get morning Josh corner okay Josh last night's debate in Manchester community college it was the second of the general election but the but the first for a lot of state why broadcast and by the way we'll be playing it back at nine o'clock this morning\nAnd ... were asking the questions what what stood out for you what is it the energy level of the candidates this race has certainly had its wrote aspects but last night was a very spirited governor she knew really press the argument and hamsters hitting the right direction on his watch Molly Kelly pushback that New Hampshire\nOn in this race but last night both candidates I'm perhaps mostly Sunni came across as one audience for a report it to me afterwards is amped let's take a listen to the new new I asked him about some of the reversals he faced on policies he pushed and then failed to get as governor right toward Murphy's law school vouchers or let me take a listen\nYou're complaining because I didn't have a hundred percent success rate but I have gotten married and I just ... done in this administration than any governor in Twenty years any governor in Twenty years go look at the record it's absolutely their child welfare reform mental health reform what we're doing it the opioid crisis is what we've done with business taxes and the economy\nOkay so that was governor Sununu admitted that he he's gotten everything he wanted but arguing he's got enough yes and you know all night long the governor strenuous in describing this and that about New Hampshire as quote the gold standard and also pumping up his roles in in getting stepped on that\nHas happened or not shocking for an incumbent nor was this propensity to downplay the blame or to blame others for any failures he didn't like that you know when the judge issued an injunction blocking the voting law known as sb three uh he called that part is a modified Democrats were blamed for\nA GOP control houses failure pass legislation to address the way for court ruling and\nYou know any bill he backed that failed he cast as kind of a David and Goliath struggling which he\nFought hard but probably really never stood a chance and you know that's where the ... that was the case or not okay so the governor was particularly zealous in kind of accent joining the positive he's an incumbent after all but what about Mali Kelly what stood out there well she said to her guns on policy she wants to raise the minimum wage to make college more affordable and went after the governor for not backing paid family leave when lawmakers debated it this\nYear a government she knew did sketch out a plan he says oh propose one relying heavily on private insurance but as you might expect Molly can we went after among us\nObviously the governor when that ... that had a bean that it and it would have to the house three ... three times in the house\nUm he had a majority of his own party in the house and Senate if he wanted to put through paid family medical leave act that was the time to do it he didn't do it had an opportunity to do it and later called the Cajun signed as governor will ensure that we do past\nWere rated on late night at least when we want to give you thirty seconds to get onto Larry Clinton chemical and then I Want I don't think it's not a vacation with me but it's obviously not a vacation that comment came as part of a bigger conversation of course is not a vacation that's that's silly\nI'm at the end of the day when their plan we realized it was a trap of an income tax we tried through the lens over men we tried to support that that didn't get past I don't control the whole house\nOkay Josh show so income tax cutting an obscure amendment and noting is lack of control over the legislature yeah I mean I think those are all sense of governor was on his heels about on this issue but more like Kelly also struggled at times when asked about someone for actions and cocker she talked to her support for public schools but they didn't want to talk about\nHer past support for mending the constitution to limit the state's obligation to pay for an adequate education at fifty percent for every people so new new for what it's worth said he would back to school funding about what they were completely take the course out of school funding\nYou know in ... also clashed over her record on taxes as a senator\nOut we bring up um you know the political fear tactic which is taxes and it continues to be brought up all the\nTime the fact that fear tactics happy honest I\nI Believe that our voters are tired of hearing that\nJosh I'm a pretty ritual part is an exchange there are certainly and you know you know both these kids really do preach their party's gospel and core issues are the independent voters of course Keene New Hampshire and one of the more memorable moments for me was that was one lure asked the cameras to name a single issue and where\nWhere they had broken with their party ... new new rattled off kindergarten Medicaid expansion which we're apt in DC away which I admit I didn't quite get Molly Kelly meanwhile smile above and looked a bit pinched and said she was stuck\nSo she served a decade in the state Senate in ... and could name a single issue or bill where she'd

second district Republican Steve Negron and become a Democrat and mclane Kuster both talked about the need for immigration reform\nWe want to make sure that we are welcoming to for immigrants that come into this country that's who we are but we need to fundamentally know who's in our country what's your purpose where you at\nWith new leadership in Congress we will get comprehensive immigration reform we have bipartisan support now for most of the elements that comprehensive package\nNow we turn to the first district congressional race Republican Eddie Edwards joins us in the studio now to talk foreign affairs\nMourning mourning thanks for having me well thank you so much for coming in and and take a short time that you have said in the past that you are supportive of President Trump's effort to build a wall in southern border\nUh you are you know in in favor of a stricter immigration standards in general what specifically we don't like to see well what I said in terms of immigration standards\nA secure the border I mean that's something that every nation Dutch\nAnd I think here in America we use this as a a wedge issue to drive us apart\nAnd this is something that the entire country should be unified on so I think when it comes to our immigration system to suggest to somehow the country is not welcoming I think it's disingenuous we're very welcoming nation\nBut you can't come here legally so we have to make sure we secure the border I think that's fair to those who are seeking to come here and it's also fair to the American worker\nNew Hampshire has seen an increase in the presence of a federal and ice officials with a regular checkpoints long I Ninety three and some popular tourist areas and I'm thinking especially in Lincoln over the summer and holiday weekends deeply those checkpoints of are effective are they good use of resources\nWell I think if I were securing the border right that that's what ISIS they're forced to secure our border so that they're doing border enforcement border security it makes sense to me what doesn't make sense to me is the amount of authority they have to write\nTheir own rules and determine how that enforcement should be down and carry it out that's more of a challenge that is more of a problem with me because of the their their independent of state ruled not just that I'm troubled by any authority given to the ministry of agencies to write their own rules and enforce those rules in Jesuit journals that's more troubling to me because\nAs you know Nineteen forty six I Believe Congress transfer a lot of his rulemaking authority to administrative agencies and that's what you see here that the more challenging standpoint is that I think they may just self determination\nThat the borders stands a hundred miles away from the border that's more concerning that that that's that's something that elected officials should be engaged in on behalf of their citizens that constituents\nSo that the notion that a a federal agency and I'm very supportive of our law enforcement and I'm very supportive of secure and I'm bored I'm very supportive ice but also I'm supportive uh uh the structure of government and when it comes to rule making and laws being crafted that should be done by the legislature not by the ministry of agency\nLet's turn our attention if we could to trade for a minute that the Trump Administration worked with Canada and Mexico to revise NAFTA been renamed the United states Mexico Canada agreement some arguing it it doesn't really change all that much there has been some movement with the dairy industry here in America being able to sell it to Canada now what's your take on that\nWell I think when we see the full details of this agreement then I'll I'll be in a better position to make that assessment but\nThe fact that this deal was renegotiated in Canada is is that tells me a great deal changes occurred and that's how people are categorized and and now that not a lot of change but I I think the fact that we we got a deal on a table and people thought we wouldn't be able to renegotiate NAFTA we wouldn't be able to to do this but that's more of the\nPartisan bickering that goes on in D.C as as opposed to the overall approach it the overall approach is to make sure the Americans being treated fairly in our trade deals\nAnd that's I think you ... you saw that with you I think you saw that one now and I think your automobile will see that with China\nWill be brought up China that's interesting because of course some businesses here in the Granite State say look you know it this is costing us money the president's position has been looked there might be some short term pain here but this is for fairness in the long term what's your feeling on\nYou know one of the pleasures I've had campaigning for instance April two thousand Seventeen is is the ability to to meet so many different wonderful people\nAnd uh I met a number of manufacturers in our state business works in our state\nWho are concerned about this and many of them of also said to me though at least the conversations I've had that they're willing to give the president some level forbearance here because they understand the ultimate goal here is to make sure that we have balance and we've been treated fairly and and some of these trade deals how much leeway do you think they're willing to go\nWell I think according to some of these folks they understand the long term ramifications rather than the short term outcomes but they're looking at just down the road because\nSome of these businesses or a fourth third generation businesses so they understand it dynamics\nThe long term viability of of your industry\nWould have talked to about possible sanctions and with Saudi Arabia since the alleged murder of ... by by the Saudi Government there have been talks from Congress and others of course about us sanctions against Saudi Arabia would would you support sanctions\nOh I I think one of the first things you you you learn as a a law enforcement officer you got to gather all the facts before you make a decision you have to is is critical ... and so I I think right now\nWe should let the facts gathers gather the facts what we do know is that it was a very he's murder committed and we should be addressing that investigating and determine who actually carrying out this murder making sure they held accountable make sure they brought forward\nAnd if Saudi Arabia is a ... directly involved they had knowledge of it they they coordinated and stuff that we should be holding them accountable\nIf you're rich thanks so much of the time thank you so much you can tune into all things considered this afternoon to hear more about health care issues from
