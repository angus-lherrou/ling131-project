surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages well\nThe whole phenomenon of the pipe bombs obviously surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was are to make a list of you know\nProgressive leaders they wanted to attack and I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important known politician\nI'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen Seventy two well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a set of his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived\nBy separating from his family and I think that ... explains a lot about the focus of his finance or being his politics and life and he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went in to find on the move to New York he opened\nOne of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start\nBecause then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nTell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\nWell I'm In the nineties a specialty was a currency pegs that looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England\nCouldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark and weren't sources right or the pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy a descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIt done in his native Hungary and then in the east European countries where his finance or had a clear\nPolitical confidence which was to build our lives and so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties own words but the switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War or once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on democratic get out the vote causes\nThat was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick if you are being attacked in the media and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the media was slurring me because it's sort of sorrow and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros them\nFigure hiding in darkness isn't just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as shattering you caught expended Russian neighbors actually is for them to be as cool the open\nSociety Institute

[noise]\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR this week we've been speaking with New Hampshire's congressional candidates on Foreign Relations and trade Republican Eddie Edwards is running the first district congressional race yesterday he said he supports stricter borders but believes ice\nDoesn't have enough oversight they're doing border enforcement border security makes good sense to me what doesn't make sense to me is the amount of authority they have to write their own rules and the term and how that enforcement should be done and carried out today we'll speak with his opponent Democrat Chris Pappas on immigration and foreign affairs morning hello Rick it's great to be with you\nI Want to talk first about immigration or what kind of immigration reform would you support in Congress\nI think there's bipartisan support today a four major pillars of what could comprise immigration reform we've seen legislation proposed in the past we've seen some false starts on this\nIt's very clear that we need to have a sober discussion about how we reform or immigration laws I Believe it needs to start with border security ensuring that we invest in manpower and in technology along our border to keep this country safe\nWe need to create a fair and orderly process for people to be able to apply for asylum and safe refuge in this country and I think we also need to allow the dreamers who known to other countries in the United states of America were brought here as children\nTo be able to become citizens of this country out there here they're contributing they should have a future in the United states\nWell given the current political climate over this issue Republicans have said consistently we we're not talking about shutting the doors were talking about reforming immigration we're talking about securing our borders but what are you going to deal you think could happen in Congress\nThere's bipartisan support for border security and it doesn't need to include a wall that's just a nonsensical idea that doesn't really work I think if we invest in technology and manpower that's the way we'll keep our borders safe but we also need to\nWho are here within our own states that have had their status question by this administration including Indonesian Christians that I've met in Dover in summers worth who have been threatened with deportation to a country that would persecute them or their lives and safety would be in danger\nHampshire has seen an increase in the presence of a federal and U.S officials with regular check points along interstate Ninety three especially our holiday weekends do you believe those checkpoints had been effective\nNew Hampshire is located entirely within the one hundred\nMile distance from our border and our coastline I think that distance needs to be reduced I don't believe that anywhere in New Hampshire you should be ... or ask for your papers I think we should be able to respect people's constitutional rights while keeping this country safe\nAnd we shouldn't be setting up checkpoints willy nilly and hassling people who are on their way to the mountains are on their way to work when it really doesn't intersect with keeping our borders safe\nSo I Would reduce that distance to twenty five miles I think that makes a lot more sense and would focus on where our law enforcement can have the most value\nI'm going to turn your attention to trade if we could trade with Canada deeply embedded in New Hampshire is economy what do you believe needs to be done to improve our trade relationship with her or northern neighbor right now\nWe've been hurt by the tariffs that have been slapped on goods\nComing into this country uh businesses have seen their costs escalate I talked to a solar company that said the costs of their panels have gone up forty percent there are companies that have lost customers altogether because of the terrorists\nSo I Believe we need a more calm and rational strategy I think the negotiations around NAFTA have produced an agreement that is workable and that I think takes us in the right direction\nAnd I think we should always be looking for a more calm and collected trade talks as opposed to a really haphazard system of tariffs that creates uncertainty and makes business more expensive for New Hampshire companies and also for consumers\nWhat about the president's assertion that look this could be some short term pain here but you know things are unbalanced trade was not fair and ah we're addressing it\nThere are indications that China has been ripping us off in terms of our intellectual property and there are reasons for us to reopen negotiations with countries from around the world\nWho are pushing unfair trade practices that are hurting America's economy in American businesses and I think that's always the right thing to do and I would encourage this administration to open up trade talks with China as a way to work through those disagreements\nSince the alleged killing of journalists ... by the the Saudi Government there had been talks and Congress about us sanctions against Saudi Arabia sent something you could support\nI think they are warranted in this case because we have a government in Saudi Arabia\nThat killed an American journalist who wrote for the Washington Post and is concerning to me that our ministry and wasn't willing to stand up to them at the beginning when the news came out and when the intelligence was pretty clear who is responsible for this the United states should always be a beacon of democracy of human rights\nOf free speech of a free press to the rest of the world\nAnd I believe that it's been compromised under this administration we shouldn't be trusting the Saudi regime simply because we sell a lot of arms to them\nWe need to talk tough to our friends and our enemies alike when it's very clear that they've been involved in acts of violence against journalists or anyone else in the world so I think we should look at ways to get to the bottom of exactly what transpired\nAnd I think sanctions and a reduction in arms sales should be on the table\nAs a way to ensure that Saudi Arabia cleans up its act\nChris Pappas thanks so much for the time thank you thanks for the time\nYou're going to happen is again this afternoon by the way and all things considered we're he'll be addressing health care issues in the Granite State and you can visit an HP are done or to listen to any of the ...\nFrom earlier in this week [noise]\nA superior court judge has denied the request by state election officials to hold off on making changes to the voter registration process until after election day but the state still isn't making any changes and is instead of asking the state Supreme Court to weigh in\nJudge Kenneth brown ordered state election officials earlier this week to go back to using the voter registration process for twenty sixteen and the upcoming the terms and eventually the courtroom yesterday he denied that require their request to delay that\nAssociate attorney general and Edwards says the state will wait for the word from the state's highest court before sending new instructions to poll workers\nExpecting an address spending I'll forward and Supreme Court is going to issue an order tomorrow afternoon it doesn't make any sense to send out some type of an interim instructions\nEdwards and understood officials told judge brown they're concerned they won't be able to make the changes that he's called for in time for the upcoming elections

was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bombs or was it surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important normal politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen fifty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation in this country and he survived\nBy separating

finance he moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trade and so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the

if you were being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the media was slurring me because it's sort of sorrow and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked to is it just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you kind of expanding Russian neighbors actually is for them to be a cool the open society Institute He's very open about it he published a cigarette is about where the donations go so I think it's hard to escape the suspicion that the critics who say either way I'm\nA ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where George finances are portrayed as the shadowy figure to manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a fairly clear indication of that tradition\nWell what do people in his native hungry thing 'cause Soros\n... and the transition away from communism things have turned more recently

congressional candidates on Foreign Relations to trade Republican Eddie Edwards is running in the first district congressional race and yesterday he told us he supports stricter borders but believes ice doesn't have enough oversight\nThey're doing border enforcement border security makes good sense to me what doesn't make sense to me is the amount of authority they have to write your own rules and the term and how that enforcement should be done and carried out today we're speaking with his opponent Democrat Chris Pappas on immigration and foreign affairs good morning hello Rick it's great to be with you\nI Want to talk first about immigration or what kind of immigration reform would you support in Congress\nI think there's bipartisan support today a four major pillars of what could comprise immigration reform we've seen legislation proposed in the past we've seen some false starts on this\nIt's very clear that we need to have a sober discussion about how we reform or immigration laws I Believe it needs to start with border security ensuring that we invest\nAlong our border to keep this country safe we need to create a fair and orderly process for people to be able to apply for asylum and safe refuge in this country and I think we also need to allow the dreamers who known to other countries in the United states of America were brought here as children\nTo be able to become citizens of this country uh they're here they're contributing they should have a future in the United states\nWell given the current political climate over this issue Republicans have said quite consistently ... we're not talking about shutting the doors were talking about reforming immigration we're talking about securing our borders we would let them deal do you think could happen in Congress\nThere's bipartisan support for border security and it doesn't need to include a wall that's just a nonsensical idea that doesn't really work I think if we invest in technology and manpower that's the way we'll keep our borders safe\nBut we also need to understand that there are individuals who are here within our own states that have had their status question by this administration including Indonesian Christians that I've met in Dover in summers worth\nWho have been threatened with deportation to a country that would persecute them or their lives and safety would be in danger\nHampshire has seen an increase in the presence of a federal and ice officials with regular check points along interstate Ninety three especially our holiday weekends do you believe those checkpoints had been effective\nNew Hampshire is located entirely within the one hundred\nMile distance from our border and our coastline\nI think that distance needs to be reduced I don't believe that anywhere in New Hampshire you shouldn't beef or ask for your papers I think we should be able to respect people's constitutional rights while keeping this country safe\nAnd we shouldn't be setting up checkpoints willy nilly and hassling people who are on their way to the mountains are on their way to work when it really doesn't intersect with keeping our borders safe so I Would reduce that distance to twenty five miles I think that makes a lot more sense and would focus on where our law enforcement can add the most value\nAnd what is your new attention to trade if we could trade with Canada deeply embedded in New Hampshire is economy what do you believe needs to be done to improve our trade relationship with her or northern neighbor right now\nWe've been hurt by the tariffs that have been slapped on goods\nComing into this country uh businesses have seen their costs escalate\nI talked to a solar company that said the costs of their panels have gone up forty percent there are companies that have lost customers altogether because of the terrorists so I Believe we need a more calm and rational strategy I think the negotiations around NAFTA have produced an agreement that is workable and that I think takes us in the right direction\nAnd I think we should always be looking for\nA more calm and collected trade talks as opposed to a really haphazard system if tariffs that creates uncertainty and makes business more expensive for New Hampshire companies and also for consumers\nWhat about the president's assertion that look this could be some short term pain here but you know things are unbalanced trade was not fair and ah we're addressing it\nThere are indications that China has been ripping us off in terms of our intellectual property and there are reasons for us to reopen negotiations with countries from around the world\nWho are pushing unfair trade practices that are hurting America's economy in American businesses and I think that's always the right thing to do and I would encourage this administration to open up trade talks with China as a way to work through those disagreements\nSince the alleged killing of journalists ... by the the Saudi Government there had been talks and Congress about us sanctions against Saudi Arabia sent something you could support\nI think they are warranted in this case because we have a government in Saudi Arabia\nThat killed an American journalist who wrote for the Washington Post and is concerning to me that our ministry and wasn't willing to stand up to them at the beginning when the news came out and when the intelligence was pretty clear who is responsible for this\nThe United states should always be a beacon\nFree speech of a free press to the rest of the world and I believe that it's been compromised under this administration we shouldn't be trusting the Saudi regime simply because we sell a lot of arms to them\nWe need to talk tough to our friends and our enemies alike when it's very clear that they've been involved in acts of violence against journalists or anyone else in the world so I think we should look at ways to get to the bottom of exactly what transpired and I think sanctions and a reduction in arms sales should be on the table\nAs a way to ensure that Saudi Arabia cleans up its act\nChris Pappas thanks so much for the time I think he thinks of the time by\nThe way I can hear more from him this afternoon on all things considered we're ... will be addressing health care issues in the Granite State you can visit an H.
