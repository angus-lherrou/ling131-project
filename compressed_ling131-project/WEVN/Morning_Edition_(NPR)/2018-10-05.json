P. R. News I'm Sarah ...\nIt's MORNING EDITION from New Hampshire public radio I'm right gambling and I'm here this morning as we are every other friday with an HBO ... Sam Evans brown hosted the podcast outside in and he's got a listener question\nI don't know anything about it we like you confused and baffled not not hard to do why do\nMake the ... the university ... can you know kind of like the Berlin\nAll right here's the question okay how can you can answer a question many new parents face today cloth versus disposable diapers I've heard that cost diapers or more environmentally friendly because they don't end up in a landfill washing them must have a lot of water and cleaning materials so they really better also have you heard of composed will diapers and are they the answer to this problem\nSam you're a a fairly new parent yourself\nYes indeed that is why this question came in but I'd like to start with a really quick anecdote\nI worked on a farm at one point with a family that try the compost diapers and things that are compost will\nDo not compost if you throw them in a landfill you have to actually compost that's true they have to be rotated around right around right and so if you're just checking them in the trash and thinking like I'm doing my bit for the world you are not\nBut anyway we worked on the phone with a family that tried to compost doubles and one of my jobs was the ... no compost bin that have been sitting there for a couple of years it was mostly soil all the way down through you know biology had done his work but I got to the bottom and there's this thick\nLayer of supposedly compost double diapers or that had been there for years and had not broken down boy what a great discovery that was who watch out for those manufacturer claims are the things may be comparable in like an industrial facility but industrial landfill or in your backyard it might not do the trick\nYeah this is kind of like a flush of old wives' way probably not necessarily as average [laughter]\nAlso I think this is the classic question that I put in the super confusing bitten because if you just Google is on line what you find is\nInformation put out by the cloth diaper manufacturers information put up by the disposable there for manufacturers\nAnd people just sort of apples on one side of the other by repeating it on their personal lifestyle blog everybody's got an opinion but not always informed well it's it's motivated reasoning is what it is and people trying to sell you their product sure and finding an actual analysis is really hard I did find to however\nBoth life cycle analyses one done in the u._k. one done in Australia and they look at the the impacts to landfills or to water consumption and energy consumption\nSo ready for the bottom line here I'm ready for science this is just a quick rule of thumb that comes from the u._k. analysis and this and this from Jennifer more Bernstein who is a lecturer at the University of Southern California she did a bunch of this research herself when she became apparent\nAbout thirty cloth diapers equal four thousand disposable diapers that's kind of the metric that's been established\nSo what she's saying there are one of the cloth diaper\nShe's saying that when it comes to carbon emissions\nThirty cloth diapers have about the same admissions profile as four thousand disposable ones of okay now a new baby will use more than four thousand disposable diapers so if you use cloth diapers that entire time and lawn to them in a relatively energy efficient way\nYou should ... some sort of carbon savings so\nHow much over the course of that two and a half years of diapering your going to say about two hundred kilograms of carbon emissions\nWhich is about the equivalent of a little bit less than two tanks of gas [laughter]\nI'm In the in the grand scheme of all of our impacts in the world especially if we're just looking at carbon emissions or this isn't a huge deal diapers are about one point six percent of our solid waste if you're concerned about landfills base you know there's a little slice there as well and\nA reasonable diverse than thirty of them like four hundred bucks up front\nSo I I I think that you know there's a there's a certain level of privilege just to be able to\nAccess the clock safer system from the beginning but um I think it's when it starts getting weird and ... that becomes problematic\nAnd let's face it some people can get weird and judge you about this particular subject\nAnd and here's the take away a [laughter] if you're a family that can't afford these diaper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "05"}
