Benson both funneled thousands just a new new Benson into new new smile for the cameras and treated jokes when Bentsen state portrait was unveiled last\nYear I'm just thrilled to not be the last Republican governor [laughter] as I gave it to a person is amazing\nWhat's new is also inspired donors with more pedestrian motives conquered Barbies bruised Burke he represents the national federation of independent businesses or group in endorsing it knew he says that Chris New news record on cutting taxes and lifting regulations is one business friendly Republicans are happy to support\nA a strong supporter of the business community has been out of business community shifts they want money and he continues to advocate for physicians business to grow\nNews also adopted fundraising tactics that allow a politician's coffers particularly an incumbent ones well he's taking lots of donations from corporate entities summer and energy\nAir energy bus companies like seeing Jay in dark with coach in Congress trail ways are also boosting the rail Scott the governor he's also relied on private events where the leg work is done by others\nBruce ... for instance set up a reception for the new new at the law firm where he works\nSoon was able to duck in duck out with some checks we did have a reception for students entering the final stretch of the campaign with a two hundred thousand dollar cash advantage over Democrat Molly Kelly but in the most recent fundraising period Shiite raised him three to one\nGOP strategist Ryan Williams says people watching this race in New Hampshire end in DC expect Christian you do to win but few it'd be impressed by his fundraising totals\nThey're lower than expected but he's managed to run the type of racy needed this far up obviously better to have more in the bank account the final month\nBetter maybe but Chris ... who may have what he needs for H. P. R. News I'm Josh Rogers\nJoining me now in the studio to talk a bit more about the governor's campaign fundraising is and his parents Josh Rogers good morning Josh the morning or so Josh as you reported the governor doesn't like asking people for money and when he does he evenings heavily on people were or entities in a position to maximize their donations can can explain that one\nWay or the governor doses to exploit a provision in the states campaign finance system you know by law individuals in corporate donors are forbidden from giving any candidate more than seven thousand dollars per election\nBut there's a loophole via the use of L. O. c.'s limited liability corporations which could be businesses or they could simply to shells or individuals can multiply their donations developers and people in real estate and perhaps best situated to do this a franchise owners have often been\nProlific givers this way a governor Sununu\nHas collected a bunch of money from Lincoln hello sees but to get back to this the point that he doesn't much light fundraising money's pulled from L. O. c.'s while significant is actually sort of small compared to past year will be candidates for governor Ted gas is Kevin Smith John Stephen all work the El Al the fundraising angle more aggressively than his synonym\nOkay but but snooze using that Pelosi loophole in in in your piece you also mentioned reception health for him at a conquered law from you know that would seem pretty standard fare for governor\nAbsolutely and you know that event in ... and all that much money about seven thousand dollars but when you're in a combine particularly one who doesn't like asking for money\nYou know any kind of fish in a barrel scenarios when you're going to welcome\nMany main well places where someone else's convene likely donors prime them to give you some money and all you really have to do is give it a few remarks are small talk at a reception\nA lot of political fundraising as like this but if you want to look at a guy like new new it helps explain why he's made attending events put on by the Republican Governors Association such a priority you know you recall in the legislature got together the summer to take up a bill addressing the way for court ruling on the Internet sales tax\nAnd effort that failed or the governor's out of state yeah he was in Colorado at the time was well he was an aspirin a at a meeting of Republican Governors Association when I spoke to the governor about all this at that time the argue that such meetings are essential why don't we take a listen\n... Republican Governors Association meeting are invaluable you've got the governor's getting together sharing best practices talking about health care to terrorists to all these issues are valuable meaning that I get\nSo Josh best practices well you know there is policy talk of these meetings but the meetings are also valuable because there are places to meet donors and also to make nice with Republican leaders who control the argues purse strings the RJ can spend big boost candidates if it chooses and you know the group has been heavily in New Hampshire him have selections\nOkay is there any sense that's new news campaign benefited much financially from that trip to Aspen well\nNothing that leaps out in his filings but you know this election isn't over yet but there's no doubt meetings like the one he attended an aspirin or do put candidates in touch with people like to give money or a case in point\nSupport for an H parents live stream comes from you our listeners and found service credit union supporting businesses throughout New Hampshire from visionary development projects to fundamental thinking needs programs and services designed for businesses who are ready to go around more I grow with SCU dot com\nAnd then if you see complained at issue there is whether the Packers followed basic reporting requirements that issue is still pending another thing it's not clear as a source of tubs money a person in his campaign filings top who lives in Cranston and has a background in tourism promotion has individually in through in L.

that have stayed in the agreement and we bonded a agreement but Russia has not unfortunately bonded the agreement so we get a German idea grave and we're going to pull out\nThis is the president's way of addressing a problem that his predecessor cold out President Obama's administration accused Russia of testing band missiles in two thousand fourteen\nNow the U.S stopped short of withdrawing from

O. c.'s limited liability corporations\nWhich could be businesses or they could simply to shells or individuals can multiply their donations developers and people in real estate or perhaps best situated to do this a franchise owners have often been\nProlific givers this way a governor Sununu\nHas collected a bunch of money from Lincoln hello sees but to get back to this the point that he doesn't much light fundraising money's pulled from El al sees while significant is actually sort of small compared to past year will be candidates for governor Ted gas is Kevin Smith John Stephen all work the El Al the fundraising angle more aggressively than his synonym\nOkay but but ... who is using that Elsie loophole in in in your piece you also mentioned reception health for him at a cocker ... from you know that would seem pretty standard fare for governor\nAbsolutely and you know that event in ... and all that much money about seven thousand dollars but when you're in a combine particularly one who doesn't like asking for money\nYou know any kind of fish in a barrel scenarios when you're going to welcome\nWhat do you mean well places where someone else's convene likely donors prime them to give you some money and all you really have to do is give it a few remarks are small talk at a reception\nA lot of political fundraising as like this but if you want to look at a guy like new new it helps explain why he's made attending events put on by the Republican Governors Association such a priority you know you recall in the legislature got together in the summer to take up a bill addressing the way for court ruling on the Internet sales tax\nAnd effort that failed or the governor's out of state yeah he was in Colorado at the time was well he was an aspirin a at a meeting of Republican Governors Association when I spoke to the governor about all this at that time he argued that such meetings are essential why don't we take a listen\nThe Republican Governors Association meetings are invaluable you've got the governor's getting together sharing best practices talking about everything from health care to terrorists to all these issues are valuable meaning that I get every year\nSo Josh best practices well you know there is policy talk of these meetings but the meetings are also valuable because there are places to meet donors and also to make nice with Republican leaders who control the Archie purse strings the RJ can spend big boost candidates if it chooses and you know the group has been\nIs there any sense that it's news campaign benefited much financially from that trip to Aspen\nWell nothing that leaps out in his filings but you know this election isn't over yet but there is no doubt meetings like the one he attended an aspirin or do put candidates in touch with people who like to give money or a case in point\nMaybe a guy who shows up in the news filings his name was Russell top ...
