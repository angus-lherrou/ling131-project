I'm concerned that there are a couple of hospitals that we know Manchester and national what hospitals\nThat are not a part of the plan I question why is that we know that Manchester Nashua have a dealing with this epidemic and a very big way and went to address that so I had some concerns\nOf or if they're not a part of the plan is some hospitals are not a part of the plans than\nWill this be successful or not I also would say that I Would add\nStrong emphasis on some of the most vulnerable I Would say victims of the opiate epidemic which are now the babies and the children were seen another generation teachers are telling me they're seen young people in schools ah who deal with and also the grandparents who are caring for the children as well\nWe know that there's a workforce shortage in the health industry in general and of course when it comes to the opioid crisis from our reporting referred several times from experts who say we just don't have enough professional sure how would you attract more professionals into the state\nWill I think there are a few ways that we can do that um I Know that there are different areas and our state I've worked closely with the regional area of the district that actually I was in the Senate and they put together a regional healthcare district doing exactly what you're talking about it I Would move that across the state so that we have\nHealthcare industry is working with all the way from high school to college or to really bring forth those uh\nThose positions we need to fund them it it's something we need to do right away a change some of the even uh what is the process what are the licensing process as what are some of the courses we could offer\nHow can we do that through our community college do our colleges even through some of the city is centers to moved that forward and to work with the industry to a mental health industry as\nUm as well as the medical industry to bring those two together\nTo using state funding though to entice those people to make training and education less expensive\nI think that we need to coordinate that with the industries that medical industry as I said as well because they are the ones who are looking for that work for us as well and it would be a collaboration\nOf both state funding and working with a businesses and industry is in particular healthcare\nWant to turn your attention to paid family medical leave obviously something that's been a big issue here in New Hampshire this year you said paid family leave is essential but there are questions about this bill that you supported within the last legislative session because that version actually work\nThat bill had gone through the house three times and was vetted and I so I think that uh\nIt was a a good bill a bill that I think is very supported that people of the state won that one paid family medical leave they value that it went to the Senate\nOr when it got to the Senate ah Chris the newness stopped it with the senators in the Senate and ah it did not pass so uh I Would support that piece of legislation Christian ... said paid family medical leave is a vacation it's not a vacation\nI've asked the governor pretty support any version of a family medical leave bill and he said you have to be voluntary that would be in a central component of do see that as being a a worthwhile compromise you know\nChristian who had an opportunity to pass a paid family medical leave in some form that he wanted to do and he didn't so you know I Will uh as governor or make paid family medical leave a reality\nYou alluded to grand children when we're talking about the opioid crisis one of your promises is to secure a stable funding for child protection in the state budget plan to do that where would that money come from\nNow I think about uh twelve billion dollar budget\nAnd if we can't find funding to take care of those children who are most vulnerable and who look to us for protection\nAnd safety than you know we're doing something wrong so ah we must and we will and that is how I Would fund a D.C Wyeth fully funded and the volunteer services\nAnd recently fully fund or you're talking about getting back to levels that we saw um more than a decade ago I mean it takes a lot of funding obviously to keep up with the recommendations to referred from the soil where would that funding come from\nReally will come from our budget and as I said\nBut presumably honors your budget would have to suffer in order for that to happen\nBut we make priorities we we we set priorities are as to what is most important and\nAs a state and I certainly our responsibility and I said moral obligation for those children who are most vulnerable I think we need to create a separate entity outside of DC way asked to coordinate is one first stop us so that people have access to a phone call when they need help and we can respond to that\nYou have talked about that independence system of care for children you've alluded to that what exactly would that look like I mean it sounds like there's some duplication of what is happening with the oil itself what would this outside department\nDo the outside department was I said we'd be like a one stop first contact and helped coordinate the other services throughout the state to ensure that those children's needs are met and and to work with the the way out but to be separate outside of DC my\nAnd that would be an additional staff and so on that would be outside of her view of ...\nWhich is necessary our responsibility to these young children\nDemocratic nominee for governor ...

P. R. let's listen to our our our good friend Donna\nThe trees have the tent caterpillar ness send them right now what are they in our they harmful and whatever happened to the gypsy moth caterpillars that devastated the trees and leaves years ago or are the tent caterpillar is in the gypsy much the same thing\nSo are they the same well so a gypsy moth in Tempe tent caterpillars are not in fact the same since she said tent caterpillars or we're gonna talk about them ah because I Am hoping that I can I can\nI can convince you all to appreciate this little worms because I'd just like ... which which some it until you learn the rules can seem like a very boring a game\nTent caterpillars which you might think are kind of gross once you once you learn a bit about them or you can really start to appreciate them and and enjoy their presence so that's where I'm gonna wait a minute Sam are you comparing tent caterpillar worms to the past time of baseball yes\nYes indeed so ten categories ... why do you suppose they build\nAttached I is it for some kind of protection I imagine from from the elements in general is ... there's they're feeding on the tree and and ... and get\nIs protection from the elements in fact the tens is to keep them warm because tent caterpillars have and have developed a nice ... and that ... that they hatch\nOut of their eggs very early in the spring so we're talking like mid April and it's really cold and they're they're cold blooded they can't regulate their own body temperature and so the hen or is typically built on the south\nSonny spot in in the tree and it's kind of like a greenhouse which actually means in fact that it's too hot and have to sort of dangled themselves on a a threat is still to stay cool um but the tent is the adaptation that allows them to get out very very early and\nEat the the the brand new leaves that are budding out on the trees are in the spring so\nDoes that help them to kind of get a jump on a other creatures in the spring before maybe they would get to the leaves for\nYeah it helps them get a jump on other caterpillars it helps them get a jump jump on on predators that might be trying to kill them or if it means that they're they're out and and in fact they're done by by June by June they met him or if I met a more frozen to adult there there are a mosque for\nA single day they mate they lay eggs and then they just live as eggs for most of the year\nOkay Sam so I can see how you can appreciate them from that level but really that they seem to be a big nuisance to I mean what are they due to the tree\nWell so that you know they're they're ... but this is a natural this is a native caterpillar so they have they have natural predators that are keeping them in check\n'em so say you've got a prize ornamental sure maybe you'd want to cut that tend to often and move it somewhere else but uh but this isn't the kind of this isn't the kind of path that's going to develop into some a widespread a playing that'll take out all your trees so you can just sort of strategically\nMove them wherever you need you know we buy and farms for our kids and watch ants do their thing so why not do the same with caterpillars and maybe instead of instead of you know letting them on fire all those sorts of things you can see people doing to the minute you you should just\nObserve them and come to appreciate them a little bit you know kind of like the game of baseball\nYou might be stretching it a bit more okay now what about the other half of donors questions she talked about uh the gypsy moth caterpillars which I remember as a kid in the early eighties were just everywhere right we don't see them as much anymore doing\nIndeed and and uh this is a story of of the success of something called ... control and what you have scientists undergoing these Indiana Jones ask a expeditions to to Europe to try to find the natural predators of the invasive gypsy moth and in fact what they found is that there is a fungus that keeps gypsy miles under control\nThey were able to bring it over to the United states get into ... over here and ever since that uh that fungus got itself out or it has been successfully keeping a gypsy moth outbreaks to a minimum basically as long as there is no drought\nW.

are in the Vietnamese community right and for me I go out in the world I experience racism I Know what it feels like to be discriminate against I I think my parents haven't because really they their lives or hear their communities here they go to Vietnamese mass they go to their customers are meeting these are or are diverse\nNow I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have\nTended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend have been leaning more democratic and that is one reason the party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo

is um I open it [laughter]\nI didn't realize how he he thought of Trump because we haven't talked about that this is the first time yeah and I had a surprise because then I'll have a conversation about the other stuff that he does against the media against like just civil society\nWe grow up knowing how undemocratic Vietnam as the crackdowns on freedom of press on basic human rights women don't have the same rights there and just see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe would be in a situation where we have a president that basically calling the press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam so we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why\nWhen Trump calls the media enemy of the people\nWhat your reaction to that\nMan you know I like all the little ball and yelled out GM they're going\nTo assume time the press talk about what the ...\nBut they don't care about it through a thing\nYou're just has CNN or didn't drum riff off so both him\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox and it's clearly is by it and I don't know if you're desert mountains of el\n... and a lot\nLike trying to you know make a phone [laughter]\nYou think you think the media\nIs too negative about Trump that he's not fair\nTo say that Russia interfered into the election in this country mhm\nBut when they know that\nWhy I said oh I shouldn't before\nThe way until drum both elected and they make issue\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with yeah the Russians where that would that bother you yeah you don't you don't believe that yeah\nThey do improve uh that I don't need to believe them\nYou know through the medical aid FBI then get the no ... no doubt he believes\nThat the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah just something you agree on yeah\nThere are a lot of families who have been divided over\nTheir views of Trump what you hear like dinner conversations that yeah that go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person I clearly have strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to you I mean I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here say that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation 'cause they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad\nHas a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom and that's why my parents let Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody got to go to vote yes you would fall choice\nAnd for future either we're thinking\nSo you think everybody should vote yeah\nAnd my father I didn't mention the any he do after the war he was\nA political prisoner for a ...\nA two year three years he was held in

EDITION from New Hampshire public radio this week we've been speaking with each gubernatorial candidate on health care issues in the Granite State today Democrats Molly Kelly joins us in Studio good morning\nGood morning how are you I'm doing well thanks for joining us and MORNING EDITION looking at an issue of course it's top of mind but voters the opioid crisis what are your plans to secure long term funding they would allow existing and new services to be sustainable\nWhere you are correct that this opiate epidemic has been a crisis I'm no if there is a family whose been untouched by this at all and\nAs governor it would be a at the top of what I Would address and we do have a twelve billion dollar budget\nAnd I believe that because this is such a crisis in his is affecting as an epidemic so many people in the state that we uh would fund what we need to do with a comprehensive plan\nI have talked about this all along as putting an emergency comprehensive plan together and to address the issue in prevention and treatment and recovery\nAs we would if it was any other medical epidemic\nYou feel it's not being done right now or the governor of course is got this urban spoke bottom it's going to be implemented by the end of the year what would you do differently\nWell I think that that is is a good start [laughter]\nSo I Am concerned that there are a couple of hospitals that we know at Manchester and national hospitals\nAre that are not a part of this plan I question why is that we know that Manchester Nashua have ah dealing with this epidemic and a very big way and went to address that so I had some concerns\nOf or if they're not a part of the plan is some hospitals are not a part of the plans then\nWill this be successful or not I also will say that I Would add\nTo the plan as well strong emphasis on some of the most vulnerable I Would say victims of the opiate epidemic which are now the babies and the children were seen another generation teachers are telling me they're seeing a young people in schools ah who deal with and also the grandparents who are caring for the children as well\nWe know that there's a workforce shortage in the health industry in general and of course when it comes to the opioid crisis from our reporting referred several times from experts who say we just don't have enough professional sure how would you attract more professionals into the state\nWell I think there are a few ways that we can do that um I Know that there are different areas and our state I've worked closely with the regional area of\nThe district that actually I was in the Senate and they put together a regional healthcare district doing exactly what you're talking about I Would move that across the state so that we have healthcare industry is working with all the way from high school to college at to really bring forth those uh\nThose positions we need to fund them it is something we need to do right away a change some of the even uh what is the process what are the licensing process as what are some of the courses we could offer how can we do that through our community college do our colleges even through some of the city centers\nTo moved that forward and to work with the industries to a mental health industry at\n'em as well as the medical industry\nTo bring those two together to using state funding though to entice those people to make training and education less expensive\nI think that we need to coordinate that with the industries the medical industry as I said as well because they're the ones who are looking for that worked for us as well and it would be a collaboration of both state funding and working with a businesses and industry is in particular healthcare\nWant to turn your attention to paid family medical leave obviously something that's been a big issue here in New Hampshire this year you said paid family leave is essential but there are questions about this bill that you supported within the last legislative session 'cause that version actually work\nThat bill had gone through the house three times and was vetted and I so I think that uh\nIt was a a good bill a bill that I think is very supported the people of the state won that one paid family medical leave they value that it went to the Senate\nOr when it got to the Senate ah Chris the newness stopped it with the senators in the Senate and uh it did not pass so uh I Would support that piece of legislation Chris news said paid family medical leave is a vacation it's not a vacation\nI've asked the governor pretty support any version of a family medical leave bill and he said yeah you have to be voluntary that would be in a central component of and do you see that as being a a worthwhile compromise you know\nChristian who had an opportunity to pass it paid family medical leave in some form that he wanted to do and he didn't so you know I Will uh as governor uh make paid family medical leave a reality\nYou alluded to credited children when we're talking about the opioid crisis one of your promises is to secure a stable funding for child protection in the state budget plan to do that we're with them\nAt twelve billion dollar budget and if we can't find funding to take care of those children who are most vulnerable and who look to us for protection\nAnd safety than you know we're doing something wrong so uh we must and we will and that is how I Would find a D.C ... fully funded and the volunteer services\nAnd recently fully fund are you talking about getting back to levels that we saw um more than a decade ago I mean it takes a lot of funding obviously to keep up with the recommendations to referred from ... where would that funding come from\nReally will come from our budget and as I said\nBut presumably honors your budget would have to suffer in order for that to happen\nBut we make priorities we we we set priorities are as to what is most important and what our responsibility is a\nAs a state and certainly our responsibility and I said moral obligation for those children who are most vulnerable I think we need to create a separate entity outside of DC way asked to coordinate is one first stop a so that people have access to a phone call when they need help and we can respond to that\nYou have talked about that independence system of care for children you've alluded to that what exactly would that look like I mean it sounds like there's some duplication of what is happening with D.C way off itself what would it just outside the department\nDo the outside department was I said we'd be like a one stop first contact and helped coordinate the other services throughout the state to ensure that those children's needs are met an end to work with D.C way out but to be separate outside of DC way\nAnd that would be an additional staff and so on that would be outside was her view of ... which\nIs necessary our responsibility to these young children\nDemocratic nominee for
