describe Hampshire voters who aren't particularly partisan independence undeclared undecided swing voters and so on\nAnd with election day around the corner these voters are also in demand especially in the states first congressional district it's an editorial swing district which means it's a tricky plays for candidates to court these voters will also appealing to their party's base and this year striking that balance has been especially difficult for Republican Edwards and his race against Democrat Chris Pappas\nFurnished fears state of democracy project born children has the story so that let me introduce my candidate\nIn August Eddie Edwards was cording Trump supporters part\nOf the president's doing one hell of a job to watch one was\nOn this particular Edwards was in the middle of a tough Republican primary and in order to when he needed to fire up Trump's New Hampshire base so they're used to it at a podium in Portsmouth with many of Trump's former New Hampshire campaign workers in front of him and do his left the president's attorney Rudy Giuliani\nWas the president wants to be the one I'm In line myself the voters are this is Ron president they want a conservative voice in Congress [noise]\nAnd he voted in the crowd that day she is a big fan of President Trump he's not afraid he's the man of strength and courage and hope to people for the future\nShe didn't know Edwards before he launched his campaign but she liked what she heard Edward seem like someone who shares Trump's vision for the country and I enjoy America First policy is very similar to Mr Trump support from voters like voted helped Edwards clinched the Republican primary but now it's nearly November\nAnd Edwards needs more than Trump space to get to Washington he\nAlso needs to win over the significant population of voters in this district who are closely aligned with a political party\nThirty nine percent of registered voters here picked undeclared as their party affiliation and that number doesn't even capture the many voters like Dan forwarding Bedford who swing back and forth between parties and vote across the ballot when I'm at Fort and recently was torn on this road\nWell so

know can they give up a Roach lately I I first ask them who they voted for the last presidential election I have to live with that would influence me in some ways\nNow mid term elections have historically been uphill battle for candidates and the same political party as a first term president but this year Trump is making the hill a bit deeper and New Hampshire Trump job approval rating among independents here has been solved\nThe latest stance on poll says just thirty three percent of independents think the country is going in the right direction\nI also talked with a lot of first district Republicans for this story who tell me they're feeling politically lost these days mainly because of the president\nAnd this brings us to the second obstacle Edwards is facing his opponent Chris Pappas\nYou know I drive from Manchester in our yard Smith home Christian in ... I'm more than a few and that sends a message\nThat's Republican strategist Jim Merrill he worked on Marco Rubio and that Romney's presidential campaigns here and he says pappas is more appealing to moderate and center right voters then past democratic nominees\nHispanic in the business community I think allows him to speak to a Republicans in a way that Carol Shea Porter never could\nPappas go on the popular puritan backroom restaurant in Manchester and he's a member of the executive council and Merrill says that background combined with ... more measured approach makes it easier for conflicted Republicans is saying well maybe I'll Try something different this year\nAre you ready for question are certainly\nI've been following Edwards around a lot lately from college Republicans meetings to this town hall and merits last week and it seems that his solution to this balancing act of courting undecided but still keeping his base he\nSolution is by talking a lot about changing our political culture he's all about term limits he bones career politicians and when he's asked about President Trump he still open about his support\nBut he pivots and talks about how divisive politics have become\nThis is just because our men are engaging in one of the other government would have assumed that won't be able to go so if you're not happy with it was also the ah the ... you have to get on to go to different countries\nDidn't Murray of wool Ferraro was listening really closely to this he was the one who asked how Edwards felt about Trump and he was pleased with the answer he got because Murray thinks some Republicans are trying to undermine the president's agenda\nAnd I'm hoping that we can elect officials in this cycle that will sports frozen increases ability to make actual changes I told Marie\nAbout that August day during the primary with Rudy Giuliani and how enthusiastic Edwards was then about the president and he's doing one hell of a job and all that Marie took a deep breath and he told me he's cutting Edward some slack\nThere is a dangerous wire you have to walk I Try to understand the candidate and we're just trying to not alienate voters joined being too enthusiastic about President Trump's because if he doesn't get there won't be able to support the president's efforts at all\nWhere he says that's why he came out to ... for the town hall that's why he donated to Edwards and why he's working the phones these Marines as if Edwards is going to have a shot at winning this thing he's going to need some extra help\nFact I'm more in children [noise]\nTo find much Martin Lawrence reporting and democracy project in fact online anytime at an H.

EDITION from an HP ... this week we're speaking with their Hampshire's congressional candidates about Foreign Relations yesterday yesterday Steve Negron who's running the second congressional district said although he supports stricter immigration reform you'd like to see more temporary us visas available for foreign workers\nThis year they actually limited the amount of those be this and it hurt our industry it hurt our retail industry you heard the hotel industry and and seasonal workers\nIs opponent incumbent Democrat and mclane Kuster joins us in the studio now to also talk immigration and foreign affairs good morning good morning Rick what kind of immigration reform would you intend to support but if you had another term in Congress sure I Would support the Senate bill\nReform passed five and a half years ago by two thirds of the Senate Senator Kelly Ayotte voted for John McCain Gene Gene I Would have voted for the very next day but my Republican leadership and the house first John Dana and then pull Ryan never held a single hearing on that bill\nSo what is plausible given the current state of affairs in Congress\nWell the truth is with new leadership in Congress we will get comprehensive immigration reform we have bipartisan support now for most of the elements of that comprehensive package\nThat build people forget had forty six billion dollars to strengthen our borders and I think that's something that we should do to strengthen our borders but it also had a pathway to citizenship that was focused on dreamers the young people that came here through no fault of their own that\nAre in school and in jobs and working toward a better life\nThere's absolutely no reason why we shouldn't come together on immigration reform literally would pass tomorrow in the house if we could get a vote\nIn relation to specific issues with immigration here in the grand state of visa programs course it's a very important subject here to Hampshire which tours and being such a major industry the president does has obviously made clear that he wants to limit these these are programs\nI did not agree with the president and employers here do I'd been on a dairy farm within the last month that needs workers I've talked to companies high tech companies and certainly as you point out the hospitality industry ski areas at summer attractions\nSo look Congress should increase the number of visas the president has been decreasing the number of diseases I think he's wrong I think the American people would support an increase particularly H ... visas where people are coming in for seasonal work and helping our economy\nLooking at trade now trade with Canada deeply embedded in New Hampshire is economy what needs to be done to improve our trade relationship with her mother neighbor\nWell first of all don't pick a fight the way the president did I was totally shocked I mean nobody is nicer than Canadians and there's no reason for America to\nThreaten that relationship I Do talk to dairy farmers who want some relief and I think the newly negotiated treaty may have some relief although it's minimal three percent\nThis is a relation to the reader negotiated NAFTA trade right\nAnd it's it's very minimal but we are hopeful that we'll get some relief to our dairy farmers here in New Hampshire but I also in very concerned about trade wars generally I think the president is too erotic I think he shoots from the hip I think the idea of foreign policy by tweet is not thoughtful\nAnd what's happening I visit companies all the time in New Hampshire that are concerned about a trade war with China\nAluminum and steel where I visited a company just a few weeks ago down in Nashua and wanted the machines that they make the cost of the component parts went up fifty five percent just because of this trade battle that the president took on with China\nMy you know the counter argument from the Trump Administration has look things were embellished things were not fair we needed to shake things up but yeah there might be some pain in the short term but this was for the long term [noise]\nWell I think we do need to constantly reevaluate our trade relationships but we're not going to win by imposing massive tariffs that then just come back to hurt us look there's always going to be winners and losers in trade but I Want to make sure that we take into account the jobs right here in New Hampshire\nLet's talk about cyber security for a moment there's been concerned from voters in New Hampshire about cyber security and and attempts from countries like Russia and China to hack us elections would you support securing federal funding for investing in improving cybersecurity\nAbsolutely I think the evidence is very clear that the Russians interfered with our election

on and with the legendary around the corner these voters are also in demand especially in the states first congressional district\nIt to the Tories swing district which means it's a tricky plays for candidates to court these voters will also appealing to their party's base\nAnd this year striking that balance has been especially difficult to Republican Edwards and his race against Democrat Chris Pappas\n... state of democracy project Lauren children has the story\nSo what's that let me introduce my candidate\nIn August Eddie Edwards was cording Trump supporters hard\nDoing one job to Washington this little one was\nOn this particular Edwards was in the middle of a tough Republican primary and in order to when he needed to fire up Trump's New Hampshire base so there he stood at a podium in Portsmouth with many of Trump's former New Hampshire campaign workers in front of him and do his left the president's attorney Rudy Giuliani\nWas the president wants to be one of the voters is Israel president they want to sort of a divorce and Congress\nAnd he voted in the crowd that day she is a big fan of President Trump he's not afraid he's a man of strength and encourage men and and hope to people for the future\nShe didn't know Edwards before he launched his campaign but she liked what she heard Edward seem like someone who shares Trump's vision for the country\nAnd I enjoy America First policies very similar to Mr Trump\nSupport from voters like voted helped Edwards clinched the Republican primary but now it's nearly November and Edwards needs more than Trump space to get to Washington he also needs to win over the significant population of voters in this district who aren't closely aligned with the political party\nThirty nine percent of registered voters here picked undeclared as their party affiliation and that number doesn't even capture the many voters like Dan forton of Bedford who swing back and forth between parties and vote across the ballot when I'm at Fort and recently was torn on this road\nWell so far I Know any Edwards I've met him and I know him and he's definitely a man of strong convictions and integrity um but ... is a smart young man and I went to high school with his father so\nSo let's pause for a second here for Edwards there are two reasons why appealing to independent voters like Gordon and still pleasing hardcore Trump supporters like Denise bode age\nIs especially hard this year and those two reasons our president Donald Trump and Chris Pappas let's first start with the president forton as you heard is undecided\nBut he says the more enthusiastic Edwards is about Trump\nThe less likely for news to support network\nI don't like the callousness and the [noise] I don't know how you describe it but it's the behaviors I'm not crazy about\nIf it's close for you it sounds like that's the kind of stuff that might matter\nUh you know candidate came up with a pro choice for the first asked them who they voted for the last presidential election I have to admit that that would influence me in some ways\nNow mid term elections have historically been uphill battle for candidates and the same political party as a first term president but this year Trump is making the hill a bit deeper and New Hampshire Trump job approval rating among independents here has been solved\nThe latest stance on poll says just thirty three percent of independents think the country is going in the right direction\nI also talked with a lot of first district Republicans for this story who tell me they're feeling politically lost these days mainly because of the president\nAnd this brings us to the second obstacle Edwards is facing his opponent Chris Pappas\nYou know I drive from ... yards at Hope Christian anyone ... a more than a few and that sends a message\nThat's Republican strategist Jim Merrill he worked on Marco Rubio and that Romney's presidential campaigns here and he says pappas is more appealing to moderate and center right voters then past democratic nominees\nHispanic in the business community I I think allows him to speak to a Republicans in a way that Carol Shea Porter never could\nPappas go on the popular puritan backroom restaurant in Manchester and he's a member of the executive council and Merrill says that background combined with happens is more measured approach makes it easier for conflicted Republicans to saying well maybe I'll Try something different this year\nAre you ready for question are certainly\nI've been following Edwards around a lot lately from college Republicans meetings to this town hall and merits last week and it seems that his solution to this balancing act of courting undecided but still keeping his base he solution is by talking a lot about changing our political culture he's all about term limits he bones career politicians\nIn when he's asked about President Trump he still open about his support\nBut he pivots and talks about how divisive politics have become\nThis is just because our men are engaging one another government office with an extra won't be able to go so if you're not there was also the ah the ... you have to get on to go to the renaissance or the other\nDay and Marie of wolf Perot was listening really closely to this he was the one who asked how Edwards felt about Trump and he was pleased with the answer he got because Murray thinks some Republicans are trying to undermine the president's agenda\nAnd I'm hoping that we can elect officials in this cycle that will sports frozen increases ability to make actual changes I told Marie\nAbout that August day during the primary with Rudy Giuliani and how enthusiastic Edwards was then about the president and he's doing one hell of a job and all that Marie took a deep breath and he told me he's cutting Edward some slack\nThere is a dangerous wire you have to walk I Try to understand the candidate and we're just trying to not alienate voters doing being too enthusiastic about President Trump's because if he doesn't get there won't be able to support the president's efforts at all\nVery says that's why he came out to ... for the town hall that's why he donated to Edwards and why he's working the phones these Marines as if Edwards is going to have a shot at winning this thing he's going to need some extra help bring HP our state of democracy
