New Hampshire that's changing how murders everywhere are being investigated here's an excerpt that podcast first episode with host Jason\nInvestigators often say that in a missing persons case the first forty eight hours in the most important is because if you don't find the person by then your odds of ever finding them are really small [noise]\nIn a murder case the first priority is to identify the victims most victims no they're killers but to know who the victim knew you had to know who the victim in\nAnd just like in a missing persons case if investigators don't get this part figured out their odds of success are really small [noise]\nNew Hampshire state police took the lead in the barrier broke investigation and they immediately began by trying to id the victims and their working theory was that given the ages the victims were likely a mother and daughter\nSo they started searching for missing persons report that matched [noise] meanwhile the Allentown pd started canvassing the town my pleasure says that's usually how crimes in Allentown resolved with all those neighborhood barbecues not to mention all the drinking gossip had a way of getting around\nAnd he had his ways of getting an out of people\nWe used to call it loves to go fishing [noise] do you make a motor vehicle stop and you knew somebody that may have known some information about a ride my my language as you do any good fishing spots [noise]\nAnd now they knew what I was talking about when we weren't actually going fishing but you know that meant the difference between I mean either receiving a warning or receiving a summons or just helping me out\nAnd it was always somebody I knew it was fishing spot always [noise]\n[noise] ...\nWhether it was a murder or a petty theft this is how police work went in Allentown in Nineteen eighty five no high tech forensics team no criminal psychologist coming up with a suspect profiled just a few patrol officers like palm pleasure rattling the bushes hoping something would fall on [noise] only nothing did\n... and that was the first thing that that throw me off this like it's a strange 'cause everybody knew everything over there [noise]\n[noise] that was an extra for the first episode of ... it's a new podcast from an HP arts launching today and joining me in the studio now is an HBO reporter and host of beer Brooke Jason moon Hi Jason hey Rick so Jason tell us a little more about the series what what spirit broke about\nAt its core it's a it's a true crime story about a unsolved or partially unsolved case from right here in New Hampshire from nearby ... state park it began in the eighties when bodies were found inside of the barrel on in some woods near the state park [noise]\nUm but it goes in so many other places beyond that it it ends up taking us all across the country to California cross decades and it spends a lot including some really interesting advances in forensic science so it's almost a half true crime in half science story of it\nAbout this story I mean why why why full podcast about it\nYeah for me it it started a couple of years ago actually in two thousand Fifteen when there was a press conference about the case not not a terribly remarkable way for a a story to start for a reporter but\nThere was some new science that was being used in that case it really piqued my interest in once I started looking into it I interviewed a couple of sources and quickly realized that\nIt just couldn't fit into a into what we normally do on the radio here I needed a needed more space and so\nYou know a couple of years later here we are trying this out trying a new format for the newsroom and taking some time to really dig in so this is going to be six episodes summer about a half hour some are closer to an hour\nAnd we're really going to dig in to the facts of the case itself the investigation and also these frankly amazing new scientific forensic techniques that are that are out there\nAnd some of these techniques involve DNA really and this is something that's developed just in the recent years that that made some breakthroughs possible here right\nThat's right if if listeners remember from earlier this year the news about the Golden State killer out of California being arrested\nThat was made possible with a new technique called genetic genealogy which was first try it out on this case from New Hampshire and the ... case and in fact the investigators on the Golden State killer case were inspired by what was done on this case and so it really\nA significant way is the beginning of a new ... you know what some people are calling a new era of criminal investigations it's a whole new technique that can open up cases that people have thought you know an solvable or or have gone on unsolved for decades now there's hope for a lot of those cases\nSo this case from New Hampshire has really changed how murders are being investigated\nDefinitely and it it's also opened up an interesting debate about that technique and in itself is a lot of privacy concerns that are raised with this technique\nUm when people put their DNA online for Jeannie logical purposes to find their long lost relatives to build family trees in certain circumstances police can take advantage of that and use it to find criminals to to help them solve crimes and\nYou know there's interesting questions that come up about well was that what you thought your DNA was going to be used for in the first place\nSo many implications down the line from this could could follow ah okay so I don't want to ask you to give away too much here this is a multi part series that we're asking listeners to to dig into but could you kind of may maybe he was in on what surprised you the most and and doing this\nWell really the bear facts of the case are are just on their own so intriguing um to have a family murdered discarded in the woods in New Hampshire and to go on identified for over three decades is just incredibly rare and\nIt just makes you wonder how could that happen how could know wouldn't have known this family how could a word that shouldn't have kids had been in school shouldn't someone have noticed basically that this family went missing\nYou know the human drama in the story is is is ... engrossing enough but are you on top of this ... this is the science and the unusual nature of the case itself\nYeah a lot of ripple effects thrown out from this case um and you're right there there is just the than the inherent drama of the true crime story and what happened in and how can we get these people identified but meanwhile it's raising\nQuestions you know far beyond New Hampshire that police in California are now using these techniques and an advocates across the country are debating about them and get back here at the heart of the mystery we still don't know who the victims are and it's just amazing that one case one story can\nYou know have all these ... and that's part why it's a six part series now\nHow ... how can listeners or get a hold of the ...\nYou can find it on line at best\nOr if you listen to ... already you can get it on

Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the cabin our case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV is turn this on so any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten in\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing\nRebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State to help to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nTrauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem\nMind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case that just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances scaring from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News this is an HP are just ahead\nThe talks to columnist and commentator Cokie Roberts who answers listener questions about hotly contested Supreme Court nominations throughout history\nWill get a little context next [noise] on MORNING EDITION from an HBO [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWinter is coming [noise]\nMaryland time to start planning your skate [noise] should support any scare today and you'll be entered a when not one\nTo one thousand dollar gift cards to Southwest Airlines so you can get out to a key Largo Monte ... ... ... you know how does that you have to act fast\nWe're giving away the first card Wednesday at ... and the second at seven PM he'll be automatically entered a when when you make your get now an H.

in New Hampshire that's changing her murders everywhere are being investigated here's an excerpt about podcast first episode with host Jason\nInvestigators often say that in a missing persons case the first forty eight hours in the most important is because if you don't find the person by then your odds of ever finding them are really small\nIn a murder case the first priority is to identify the victims most victims know their killer but to know who the victim knew you had to know who the victim in [noise]\nAnd just like in a missing persons case if investigators don't get this part figured out their odds of success are really small [noise] New Hampshire state police took the lead in the ... investigation and they immediately began by trying to id the victims [noise]\nThey're working theory was that given the ages the victims were likely a mother and daughter\nSo we started searching for missing persons report that matched [noise] meanwhile the Allentown pd started canvassing the town want pleasure says that's usually how crimes in Allentown resolved with all those neighborhood barbecues not to mention all the drinking gossip head away\nHad his ways of getting out of people we used to call it plus to go fishing [noise] do you make a motor vehicle stop and you knew somebody that may have known some information about a ride my my line was you know any good fishing spots [noise]\nAnd now they knew what I was talking about when we weren't actually going fishing but you know that meant the difference between I mean either receiving a warning or receiving assignments or just helping me out and it was always somebody I knew I was fishing spot hot ways\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhether it was a murder or a petty theft this is how police work went in Allentown in Nineteen eighty five no high tech forensics team no criminal psychologist coming up with a suspect profiled just a few patrol officers like my pleasure rattling the Bush is hoping something would fall and only nothing did\nAnd that was the first thing that that throw me off is like [noise]\nStrange 'cause everybody knew everything over there\nThat was an extra for the first episode of Barry ... gets a new podcast from an HP arts launching today and joining me in the studio now is an HBO reporter and host of bear Brooke Jason moon Hi Jason hey Rick so Jason tell us a little more about the series what what spirit broke about\nWell at its core it's a it's a true crime story about a unsolved or partially unsolved case from right here in New Hampshire from nearby ... state park it began in the eighties when bodies were found inside a barrel on in some woods near the state park [noise]\nUm but it goes in so many other places beyond that it it ends up taking us all across the country to California cross decades and it spends a lot including some really interesting advances in forensic science so it's almost a half true crime in half science story it at its core\nIs that what intrigued you about this story I mean why why why for podcast about it\nYeah for me it it started a couple of years ago actually in two thousand Fifteen when there was a press conference about the case or not a terribly remarkable way for a story to start for a reporter but\nThere was some new science that was being used in that case it really piqued my interest in once I started looking into it I interviewed a couple of sources and quickly realized that\nIt just couldn't fit into a a into what we normally do on the radio here I needed a needed more space and so\nYou know a couple of years later here we are trying this out trying a new format for the newsroom and taking some time to really dig in so this is going to be six episodes summer about a half hour some are closer to an hour\nAnd we're really going to dig in to the facts of the case itself investigation and also these frankly amazing new scientific or forensic techniques that are that are out there\nAnd some of these techniques involve well it's DNA really and this is something that's developed just in the recent years that that made some breakthroughs possible\nHere right that's right if if listeners remember from earlier this year the news about the Golden State killer out of California being arrested\nThat was made possible with a new technique called genetic genealogy which was first try it out on this case from New Hampshire and the ... case and in fact the investigators on the Golden State killer case were\nInspired by what was done on this case and so it really in a significant way is the beginning of a new\n... you know what some people are calling a new era of criminal investigations it's a whole new technique that can open up cases that\nPeople have thought you know an solvable or or have gone on to unsolved for decades now there is hope for a lot of those cases\nSo this case from New Hampshire has really changed how murders are being investigated\nDefinitely and it it's also opened up\nIn it of itself there's a lot of privacy concerns that are raised with this technique\nUm when people put their DNA on line for Jeannie logical purpose is to find their long lost relatives to build family trees in certain circumstances police can take advantage of that and use it to find criminals to to help them solve crimes and [noise]\nYou know there's interesting questions that come up about well was that what you thought your DNA was going to be used for in the first place\nSo many implications down the line from this could could follow uh okay so I don't want to ask you to give away too much here this is a multi part series that we're asking listeners to to dig into but could you kind of may maybe he was in on what surprised you the most and and doing this\nWell really the benefactor the case or or just on their own so intriguing um to have a family murdered discarded in the woods in New Hampshire and to go on identified for over three decades is just incredibly rare and\nIt just makes you wonder how could that happen how could know wouldn't have known this family how could a word that shouldn't have kids had been in school shouldn't someone have noticed basically that this family went missing\nYou know the human drama and the story is is is engrossing enough but ... you're on top of this they deserve to science in the unusual nature of the case itself\nYeah a lot of ripple effects thrown off from this case um and you're right there there is just the than the inherent drama of the true crime story and what happened in and how can we get these people identified but meanwhile it's raising\nQuestions you know far beyond New Hampshire that police in California are now using these techniques and an advocates across the country are debating about them and you get back here at the heart of the mystery we still don't know who the victims are\nAnd it's just amazing that one case one story can you know have all these ... and that's part why it's a six part series now\nOkay Jason how can listeners or get a hold of this broadcast series you\nCan find it on line at bear Brooke pod cast dot org or if you listen to ... already you can get it on whatever podcast after using at the moment\nI tuned six cetera et cetera not right and experience chase move here to tell us about the new podcast series ... broke from New Hampshire Public Radio's Jason
