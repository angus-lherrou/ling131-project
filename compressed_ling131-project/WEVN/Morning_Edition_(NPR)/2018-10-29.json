Ninety seven he was known for exaggerating claims and he made some threatening statements before the shooting the attack Jews on social media\nHe connected Jews to the caravan that's a group of migrants slowly moving toward the United states border to ask for entry into the U.S who have been described as a grave threat by President Trump having made those statements the suspect spent twenty

squirrel hill this neighborhood where this happened how are people doing\nI mean the night of the shooting there was a lot of shock um in many of the of the Jewish community were in other synagogues

later\nAnd then you always hearing two narratives one was this ancient anti Semitism which has been around for centuries and Jews or you know in in a weird sad way it makes sense to them it's not new

a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the skin cream she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to lip bomb Neal spore and the doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test bends or pain\nCall a phony um they tested her for a hundred in Nineteen Seventy usually found and beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol\nThey put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they test it she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later\nThe bill came I was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nI didn't have any needles stuck in me I had no scaffold stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know if it out of four cylinder six or under its or engine does it have the top of the wind blew to stereo

thousand dollars the company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the mass just doesn't add up ... says the customary charge for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about\nCan go she did that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano oh and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases\nAnd that grand piano Winston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive through Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that about forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think\nWe have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks

you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and like you're in for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively\nI should say though that most NATO himself insists the survival of dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president to Brazil Supreme Court voted\nOff to its heat rather help part of the constitution to reporters\nAbout the need for the future presidents who respects to the judge had to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says yes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essentially shoe but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and ...\nThat would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example his Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nHe's really on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe this I think he's a really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhat he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license\nHe also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do do already people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high mood right\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks you welcome\nNow we are more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he

like that where you you you want us to just censor anybody that said afraid I'm going in that what you're proposing here well I rented and here's the thing the answer to that speech or hate speech however you want to define that\nIs more speech and always will be\nWhen this online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the man accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats in the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats he says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWinter thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're

by is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional famers intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible with their speech she says\nLast year Google band gaps up apple rejected and Microsoft terminated its agreement with it last month just in the last twenty four

trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the ... she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to lip bomb new ...\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBend a pain call a phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement is usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSaid that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they test it she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nI didn't have any needles stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know that at a four cylinder ... engine does it have the top of the line Bluetooth stereo

dollars a company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the math just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expense of San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she negotiated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases\nAnd that grand piano Winston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take\nTest can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King was a lovely\nImage at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it there is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expense who could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars\nSo I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage comes from

right\n[noise]\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he'll take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that she is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and cry\nIf national pride I don't think that it helps explain why both now defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution but he is setting a load of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted\nAn off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo judge how to remind him and the people that people ... about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which this is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe this I think he's really good\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force than they do do already\nPeople hit David are sick of robberies and the sky high moody right yet the prospect of more guns ... police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are
