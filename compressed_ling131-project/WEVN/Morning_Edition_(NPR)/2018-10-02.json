the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us\nTo get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how differently the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and I my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own\nTo have a number one in the class I thought well no no no no no no in the car on what I thought oh no I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my ... year in ...\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her\nTrace there's been exploring the idea of women and anger and her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger\nAt some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious and it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and\nThere's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not

earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact women of color who has been the leaders and the leading fingers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about meat you one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment\nStems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color whose stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past\n... years although we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so is women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around calving off is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future [noise]\nRitual book there was Rebecca Traister author of people go to map the

to find out just how much control one state can have over a giant Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Kim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nAnd they actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice not neutrality\nYou know I I think that they they uh uh I've decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's open for business I guess as their argument and are they are concerned that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how is that is ... is California's position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that the the uh for broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state uh but you know about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little ... as an open question what California is going to say\nIs listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally and when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's what California's argument will be\nWhat is the president just get sad and dozens of other states are considering net neutrality last may\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality love it you know it gets it gets to a very fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically feeling gaps the federal government has abandoned that neutrality\nFor reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rules for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular discrimination in California we should note his is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum\nYou know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is is dangerous so it's not a case where the Trump or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word the California law on the other hand it's a quiet\nThat it really does regulate interstate commerce phrase goes and so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level was really local or\nReally national or international I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see uh the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I think almost all of them on ... they like in the intro the law they don't like the idea that you know calm coaster or TNT will try to charge them extra block their content\nMost people vast majority Americans wanting to troll the laws that sort of the food for an audience of to the ... the brother in law being the Trump Administration or this law and so I'm not surprised from the states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time it's been a pleasure [noise]\nHow much besides the title is really changing in the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American\nAuto worker but as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U. S.\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way have a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIO Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the auto industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists Chad ... is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nHe says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now has to be made with workers that are earning higher\nJust means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that balance as it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia or if you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build automobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor gains from the deal ...

it\nA coup frankly\nWhen California became the first state to abolish cash bail late this summer\nGovernor Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor like we'll be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system savers the wealthy and punishes the poor\nTurns out that the story is more complicated now many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform say the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports from his\nHome in the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney chase Abou dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or SP ten\nWhich abolish is money bailing America's most populous state after all ... and fellow public service lawyers have long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of biased system\nThe size of your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood\nI was disappointed in and I felt betrayed the newest be ten doesn't actually change the race is system of mass incarceration just expand\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process\nNow under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety routine believes this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deep in the bill section Thirteen twenty that Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded ... argues it couldn't compass anyone for any offense that he says will to power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder sb ... and now prosecutors can seek detention\nFor virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused has a prior history under this law prosecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nThen there's its impact on plea deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nHe's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting an arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney ... says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse\nOr the various factors that they use risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say Sharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist\nFen already notes that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges this new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should also right that's right and I was like they shouldn't be where people are ending\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsmen in an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who say there'll be ready to challenge the law's constitutionality in court as soon as it takes effect next year Eric Westervelt NPR News San Francisco\n[noise]\n\nGood morning at seven forty eight and you're listening to MORNING EDITION on an H.

is on track to find out just how much control one state can have over a giant Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration were moved to those standards at the federal level Tim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nAnd they actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I I think that that they uh uh of decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's it's open for business I guess as their argument and uh they're concerned that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh the broadband providers in California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state uh but you know about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say\nIs listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the wire to the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to control everything and so I think that's what California's argument will be\nWhat is the precedent this kid sets and dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nFact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality laws you know it gets it gets to a very fundamental policy question which is\nOne of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically filling gaps the federal government has abandoned the neutrality for reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union\nIn other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where\nSo I think that that's what's at stake here is a really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest so one thing I think\nThat makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do we know we think this is is dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word California law on the other hand it's a question of the California go law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think\nThat it's a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see uh the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I think almost all of them on the they've also they they like in the intro the law they don't like the idea that\nYou know Comcast are already TNT we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people have vast majority Americans wanting to troll the laws that sort of the uh it's a it's an audience of to the slow the it's the abroad been lobbying the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time\nIt's been a pleasure [noise] how much besides the title is really changing in the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American\nAuto worker that is President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way have a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now they're in such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd in less strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent look\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists Chad ... is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nSays such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that balance as it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build automobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor gains from the deal ...
