but one of the biggest barriers we find the families and individuals is getting that relaxes so now we're going to have our nine hubs we're setting those up as of January first across the state\nAnd it's not just a treatment center a recovery center but it looks at everything from mental health assessment workplace recovery programs getting folks transitional housing a whole variety\nOf things that come into play in ensuring that we're we're walking hand in hand if you will with those that are facing addiction the reason this is so important is because right now our model\nPeople go through treatment maybe they go through the recovery maybe they get better but a lot of them don't a lot of them get back into that very negative cycle of treatment in recovery the costs are skyrocketing this new model will help\nMassively reduce the recidivism if you will of folks entering treatment in recovery so they hopefully they go through at one time they get themselves and their families on to a better path healthier path for the long term\nThat overall can drastically reduced the long term costs and that's what this was about a very significant one time investment\nWe have about forty five million coming in over the next two years to really get a system up and running that massively reduces the overall cost\nBut again after the two plus years what do we\nSupport for any ... life's dream comes from you our listeners and from Congress regional visiting nurse association\nA home health in hospice agency serving people of all ages and more than forty one communities discover how the conquered regional DNA can help you remain independent in your home and live life to the fullest\nIt the RV an A. dot\nOrg and know that clearly it's it is not they're always looking at new grants and new programs\nOn this money is really designed for a one time set up infrastructure money if you will but combined with what we've been able to do with our long term funds here in the state combined with some other federal ten if moneys that might come down the road I have no doubt that this is a system that will be sustainable at much lower costs with much better results for New Hampshire\nWhat about the workforce issue though surrounding a health care in general and of course mental health specifically we do have you know high turnover rates in the healthcare industry it's difficult for people to get access to the already existing services in the state because there's just not enough trained professionals how'd you get that workforce how you retain them\nSo the state is going to be making one of the biggest investments in health care workforce it has ever made we're going to be looking to double the number of nurses coming out of UNH we're gonna expand programs in Keene organ expand programs at plum estate\nAnd make those investments that really matter and it's not just for nurses it's for late acts and clinicians psychiatry all these different areas of health care the state's making very significant one time investments in this next budget cycle to make sure\nThat health care workforce is not just talked about we're actually going to do something about it and put ourselves on the forefront of making sure that that is no longer a barrier to providing a better quality of service a better product if you will for the citizens of New Hampshire\nWhat about improving access to health insurance markets governor is there anything that states individually can be doing to push forward themselves\n[noise] well you know our health insurance market was on the verge of collapse about a year ago and we saw other states their health care exchanges fell apart ours didn't we really worked with our partners we work with the federal government we got the waivers that that we wanted to get to allow the flexibility for insurance providers to maintain their status within the exchange market\nWe've broken out a lot of berries of regulation um because of what happened in the late nineties where we basically went down to one or just to um insurance insurers in the state\nAnthem does a great job I mean they really control a lot of that private market they do a very good job with it but you always want competition to come in so we're trying to entice competition to come in but you still got to be able to to go out and kinda sell it kind of marketing\nYou say you would support a voluntary system for paid family medical leave but but how would that actually work and no other states have been able to develop a a voluntary system successfully did you have a model for that\nWe do we do I'm very excited about about the model that we're working on it's again a public private partnership that doesn't put the obligation I'm In a mandate if you will and all the employees that doesn't trap employees into what is essentially an income tax which is exactly what the Democrats planted\nBy having a voluntary system something that doesn't track people into an income tax works with the public private partnership and also my plan is looking to actually include the state employees they're playing did in my plan will that's a real opportunity for the state and yes other states haven't done it we're going to lead the nation I I think and what we put together\nFor a voluntary program would you also have the the lowest income people probably wouldn't necessarily be opting in to take this\nRight but I don't care whether you're low income or high income if you want to opt in you walked in if if you don't you don't I don't I didn't understand your question maybe\nWhat I'm saying is I think for lower income people may need that benefit the most and will be less likely necessarily to voluntarily opt into the system\nYeah but that's their choice if if they want to opt in and and and they they want to opt into the system they can opt in and they get the benefits from that and if they don't want to opt in and they don't get the benefits from that it's it's their choice it's up for the government to force people into a system\nLast legislative session a twenty new case workers were added to the ... but\nSays they need more than a hundred and Seventy additional workers to keep up with caseloads that they're seeing how will you continue to address the divisions need for for more resources\nSo you know the one of those issues we have even the the available positions that we've created and we've treated like I think with the two pieces of legislation I think it's thirty three the first a budget or did twenty I think we did another Fifteen or so and\nThe child welfare bill most comprehensive child welfare reform bill that the state has done in Twenty years very proud of that added even more workers to the question you asked earlier we're having trouble actually even filling those vacancies right you can add a hundred new positions but if you can't fill the first position what's the point of the next Ninety nine\nSo what we need to do is focused on on wages focus on the opportunity that we can create whether it's through student loan repayment programs investing in the workforce for ourselves so the workforce can start really building up\nAnd as other additional workers and needs to come online absolute you need to address it in the areas that are are most of high need that would be D.C wife mental health these areas of health care that we've been talking about that's where our priority in our investments are going to go\nGovernor ... thank you for the time thank you [noise] you can listen to all

an was hearing from lots of public servants who said they made it years into the program\nAnd found out their plan for financial freedom essentially just wiped out in the blink of an eye because of the mistakes of their student loan company\nHere's what was happening from and says the federal government pays a bunch of companies to manage more than forty million student borrowers\nThese

station [noise]\nThis week on MORNING edition we're speaking with each gubernatorial candidate on health care issues here in the Granite State and today my conversation with Republican incumbent Governor Chris Sununu\nMorning wreck when it turned her attention of course to um what's on somebody voters' minds these days the opioid crisis you've got money secured to set up these addiction hubs across the state but what are your plans for securing long term funding to make those hubs sustainable\nLet's talk about the the hub and spoke model that we're creating a New Hampshire's incredibly unique and it's something that we went down work with the administration we proposed it we walk them through steps what it would look like\nAnd the reason it's so important is it a whole new direction that the state's going to take in providing rural access to care\nA right now we have we have good programs and good providers and in some of the bigger cities of the state but one of the biggest bears we find the families and individuals is getting that relaxes so now we're going to have our nine hubs we're setting those up as of January first across the state\nAnd it's not just a treatment center a recovery center but it looks at everything from mental health assessment workplace recovery programs getting folks transitional housing a whole variety of things that come into play\nHand in hand if you will with those that are facing addiction and the reason this is so important is because right now our model\nPeople go through treatment maybe they go through recovery maybe they get better but a lot of them don't a lot of them get back into that very negative cycle of treatment in recovery the costs are skyrocketing this new model of help\nMassively reduce the risk ... if you will of folks entering treatment in recovery so they hopefully they go through at one time they get themselves and their families onto a better path a healthier path for the long term\nThat overall can drastically reduced the long term costs and that's what this was about a very significant one time investment\nAnd we have about forty five million coming into the next two years to really get a system up and running that massively reduces the overall cost\nBut again after the two plus years\nWhat do we do absolutely when I came into office the alcohol thunder only had about three and a half million dollars you know I've tripled the amount of money into that program and I've done it to a public private partnership and taking it off of the back of the taxpayers we've gotten a hospital's involved and they've been a great partner and providing over ten and a half million a year not for the next two years but for the next five\nSo we tripled the amount of money that we're going to have available to us to maintain these programs in the long term is this the last many will get out of the federal government know that clearly it's it is not they're always looking at new grants and new programs\nOn this money is really designed for a one time set up infrastructure money if you will but combined with what we've been able to do with our long term funds here in the state combined with some other federal ten of monies that might come down the road I have no doubt that this is a system that will be sustainable at much lower costs with much better results for New Hampshire\nWhat about the workforce issue though surrounding a health care in general and of course mental health specifically we do have you know high turnover rates in the healthcare industry it's difficult for people to get access to the already existing services in the state because there's just not enough trained professionals how'd you get that workforce how you retain them\nSo the state is going to be making one of the biggest investments in health care workforce it has ever made we're going to be looking to double the number of nurses coming out of UNH we're going to expand programs in Keene organ expand programs at plum estate\nAnd make those investments that really matter and it's not just for nurses it's for late acts and clinicians psychiatry all these different areas of health care the state's making very significant one time investments in this next budget cycle to make sure\nThat health care workforce is not just talked about we're actually going to do something about it and put ourselves on the forefront of making sure that that is no longer a barrier to providing a better quality of service a better product if you will for the citizens of New Hampshire\nWhat about improving access to health insurance markets governor is there anything that states individually can be doing to push forward themselves\nWell you know our health insurance market was on the verge of collapse about a year ago and we saw other states their health care exchanges fell apart ours didn't we really worked with our partners we work with the federal government we got the waivers that that we wanted to get to allow the flexibility for insurance providers to maintain their status within the exchange market\nWe've broken out a lot of berries of regulation um because of what happened in the late nineties where we basically went down to one or just to um insurance insurers in this state\nAnthem does a great job I mean they really control a lot of that private market they do a very good job with it but you always want competition to come in so we're trying to entice competition to come in but you still got to be able to to go out and kinda sell it kind of marketing\nYou say you would support a voluntary system for paid family medical leave but but how would that actually work and no other states have been able to develop a a voluntary system successfully did you have a model for that\nWe do we do I'm very excited about about the model that we're working on it's again a public private partnership that doesn't put the obligation I'm In a mandate if you will and all the employees that doesn't trap employees into what is essentially an income tax which is exactly what the Democrats planted\nBy having a voluntary system something that doesn't trap people into an income tax worked with the public private partnership and also my plan is looking to actually include the state employees they're playing did in my plan will that's a real opportunity for this\nIt we're going to lead the nation I I think and what we put together\nFor a voluntary program but you also have the the lowest income people probably wouldn't necessarily be opting in to take this\nRight but I don't care whether you're low income or high income if you want to opt in you walked in if if you don't you don't I don't I didn't understand your question maybe\nWhat I'm saying is I think for lower income people may need that benefit the most and will be less likely necessarily to voluntarily opt into the system\nYeah but that's their choice if if if they want to opt in and and and they they want to opt into the system they can opt in and they get the benefits from that and if they don't want to opt in and they don't get the benefits from that it's it's their choice it's up for the government to force people into a system\nLast legislative session a twenty new case workers were added to the ... but last we've reported the divisions director says they need more than a hundred and Seventy additional workers to keep up with caseloads that they're seeing how will you continue to address the divisions need for for more resources\nSo you know one of the issues we have even the the available positions that we've created and we've treated like I think with the two pieces of legislation I think it's thirty three the first a budget or did twenty I think we did another Fifteen or so and\nThe child welfare bill most comprehensive child welfare reform bill that the state has done in Twenty years very proud of that ad it even more workers to the question you asked earlier we're having trouble actually even filling those vacancies right you can add a hundred new positions but if you can't fill the first position what's the point of the next Ninety nine\nSo what we need to do is focused on on wages focus on the opportunity that we can create whether it's to student loan repayment programs investing in the workforce for ourselves so the workforce can start really building up\nAnd as other additional workers and needs come online absolute you need to address that in the areas that are are most of high need that would be D.C wife mental health these areas of health care that we've been talking about that's where our priority and our investments are going to go\n... thank you for the time thank you [noise] you can listen to all things considered this afternoon to hear

happy about that [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one\nAt the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama his
