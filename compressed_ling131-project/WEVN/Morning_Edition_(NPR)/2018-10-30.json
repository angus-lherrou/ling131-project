MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene many of us have something going on in our lives that could shape how we vote on November ...\nMaybe it's a family crisis pending job change maybe the birth of a child over the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring his conversations about personal questions or anxiety but shape election decisions the first is with Isabel firemen from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named mark ...\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's her conversation with rich Moran\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me I first I was saying hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going back per se you know a lot you know as I was reading in bed you know is very\nHeartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's\nATM password and emptied out the bank account um well your father and his grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore\nSo he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nYes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived ... for short period of time\nAnd he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best health would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people and after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was\nCombative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years and you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that planet the seed because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough\nBuddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now it's it's it's a process\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington\nChange in any life but especially in a life like yours were you and your son have endured this [noise] but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices that you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it\nAnd why did my son have to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why didn't we not have the ability to get the help our candidates talking about this issue in Florida\nNo they're not right now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons and we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need to make it through the day sometimes\nAre you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change and I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is that state to state so different why is there help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform\nI look at the realities of our life what candidate will give the access to the programs are people need health care\nDrug counseling who will support fat\nAnd to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be\nSomeone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means Isabel your your whoever won once President Trump especially wants to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary [noise]\n[noise] I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now and all the discord\nIt's like if he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants what's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves but to take criticism and he'd just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran\nAnd that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas [noise]\nLesley I'll just close by asking you how things are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how has your relationship\nIt's as strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I got his back till my last breath\nVisible
