last decade checked kitchens is the new director for the state's largest airport and he joins us now to talk about how he plans to keep services in Manchester competitive with other airports in New England\nCan you tell us a little bit about your background and and where you were before coming to New Hampshire\nSure I was the general manager at George Bush in her continental airport in Houston, Texas for three years before that I was a deputy director at a small airport and Virginia Newport News Williamsburg international airport\nSo how will you translate your experience from you know a much larger airport to do a small city like Manchester\nAt the at the end of the day is the same Federal Aviation administration regulations is the same department of homeland security regulations that we are a failed to and are expected to meet every day be at a George Bush airport or here at Manchester Boston\nAt the end of the day our primary mission is to make certain that we operate a safe and efficient airport in compliance with all federal rules and regulations in state rules and regulations and that is true at any airport that an airport manager works\nAs you're settling into the position do uh what are some of the the specific challenges you might see better here in Manchester you know what do you see as as going well what do you see is maybe you know would you can envision some future changes will what's your assessment\nSo one of the things I'm working on right now is is interviewing a sitting down a on a one on one basis with each of the employees and and then I'll extend that to all of our tenants and other stakeholders here at the airport\nAnd just ask them that very question I asked me what are we doing right what are we doing wrong what can we do better how can I help them be more successful than they already are obviously the issue that is out there the most is the number of flights and our air service issues that we're experiencing here at the airport\nPhone ask about that because there has been a steady decline in the number of passengers every year since so five I think at this point do you do you have any plans to get more people to fly out of Manchester\nSure I mean there are some things that we could we could possibly do differently that the end of the day it is a an air carrier decision as to the level of service that they want to put into into a market\nBut at the same time there are some things that we could do to make ourselves maybe a little more attractive to those carriers and those are some some of the elements that I'll need to sit down and talk with a senior staff\nAbout after this listening tours I like to call it is as complete and then we hear from the carriers and we hear from our ten minutes\nAbout the what we're doing right and what we're doing wrong I think there there's some some things that we can do to help us be a little more attractive and a part of that is looking at our cost structure here at the airport\nAnd that's what you do going to entice them obviously you want to keep costs down but at the end of the day of course you need to get that passenger volume up right\nExactly and that's that is a decision that each consumer makes on a daily basis when a when they log on to an airline's Web site and they are looking at a making a a travel decision we want them to think Manchester first\nPersonal decision about can we help influence that they're marketing and advertising certainly weekend but I think if we if we focus on our cost structure and we work with are carriers on our relationships then we might be able to\nHelp and types of carriers to provide a more product in here some more choices may be some better fares that would help drive additional traffic to to the airport\nWhen you're talking about bringing costs down for carriers and in order to entice them to add more flights or even to bring the men in the first place what can you do specifically to bring those costs down\nI think there are some ways that we can look at our long term debt how has a structured were taken some steps here already to to restructure some of our uh our of our debt load\nOr they'd be looking at some of our contractors services that we have here at the airport now are you still getting the best business deal that we can get from solve our contractors services so I think

we are the Manchester Boston regional airport has seen a steady decline the passengers within the last decade\nTake kitchens is the new director for the state's largest airport and he joins me to talk about how he plans to keep services in Manchester competitive with other airports in New England ... tell us a little bit about your background and and where you were before coming to New Hampshire\nSure I was the general manager at George Bush intercontinental airport in Houston, Texas for three years before that I was a deputy director at a small airport in Virginia Newport News Williamsburg international airport\nSo how will you translate your experience from you know a much larger airport to do a small city like Manchester\nAt the at the end of the day is the same Federal Aviation administration regulations is the same department of homeland security regulations that we are upheld too and are expected to meet every day be at a George Bush airport or here at Manchester Boston\nAt the end of the day our primary mission is to make certain that we operate a safe and efficient airport in compliance with all federal rules and regulations in state rules and regulations and that is true at any airport that an airport manager works\nAs you're settling into the position do or what are some of the the specific challenges you might see that are here in Manchester it you know what do you see as as going well what do you see is maybe you know where you can envision some future changes will what's your assessment\nSo one of the things I'm working on right now is is interviewing sitting down a on a one on one basis with each of the employees\nAnd and then I'll extend that to all of our tenants and other stakeholders here at the airport and just ask them that very question that you just asked me what are we doing right what are we doing wrong what can we do better how can I help them be more successful than they already are\nObviously the issue that is out there the most is the number of flights and our air service issues that we're experiencing here at the airport\nPhone ask about that because there has been a steady decline in the number of passengers every year since so five I think at this point do you do you have any plans to get more people to fly out of Manchester\nSure I mean there are some things that we could we could possibly do differently that the end of the day it is a an air carrier decision as to the level of service that they want to put into into a market\nBut at the same time there are some things that we could do to make ourselves maybe a little bit more attractive to those carriers and those are some some of the elements that I'll need to sit down and talk with a senior staff\nAbout after this listening tour as I'd like to call it is as complete and ... and we hear from the carriers and we hear from our ten minutes\nAbout the what we're doing right and what we're doing wrong I think there there's some some things that we can do to help us to be a little more attractive and a part of that is looking at our cost structure here at the airport\nAnd that's what you do going to entice them obviously you want to keep costs down but at the end of the day of course you need to get that passenger volume up right\nExactly and that's that is a decision that each consumer makes\nOn a daily basis when a when they log on to an airline's Web site and they are looking at a making a a travel decision we want them to think Manchester first\nAnd that is something that at the end of the day as a personal decision now can we help influence that through marketing and advertising certainly we can but I think if we if we focus on our cost structure and we work with are carriers on our relationships than we might be able to help entice the carriers to provide a more product in here some more choices\nMaybe some better fares that would help drive additional traffic to to the airport\nWhen you talk about bringing costs down for carriers in in order to entice them to add more flights or even bring them in and the first place what can you do specifically to bring those costs down\nI think there are some ways that we can look at our long term debt how has a structured where take some steps here are ready to to restructure some of our ah our of our debt load or they'd be looking at some\nSupport for an HP

Dave\nYou can reach about a mile and a half worth of fungal threads in when you begin one cubic inch ...\nWhat's the role of fungi in nature we have basically three types of fungi that play a

don't favor the host and they're known as parasites in third and perhaps most importantly\nYou have the Mike arise all species of fungi now they used to have a very special relationship with plants we have a mutual a stick or what they call symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi where the plants produce the sugars that the fungi require\nAnd the fungi break down the nutrients in the soil and transfer those to the plant roots for uptake over Ninety eight percent of our plant species have Mike arise a\nGrowing with their roots that allow them to survive allowed them to flourish allow
