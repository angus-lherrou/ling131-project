become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited duration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat's Doug ... a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck double as met\nSome people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for

inspired the original every year so\nIt does it mean Dr ... from the I Am a tea I committed to helping those who are driven by purpose reached their definition of\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven war\nI think probably two state is more likely but you know what if they do a single if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they're both happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides would get to a second state the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less some Palestinians have been shifting focus\nPalestinian analysts ... so you told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care to state that represents them is Israel or Palestine or some other science fiction I mean these are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity therapy which they fulfill themselves as individuals and groups\nIn every possible way that any American or British person or Chinese person wouldn't well\nPalestinians today of trouble going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces the demand for equal rights is provocative you'd implies that gift Palestinians are denied a state millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter differently he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when it came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\n[noise] perfect people different when referred to stir forever and going into the liberal or to talk about the folks in my view of potential agreement power for should be able to all the power struggle\nThe key power that must not be in their hands is the question of security in the tiny area west of the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width of about fifty sixty kilometers mhm\nWhere both Palestinians and Israelis live Israel must return the overriding\nSecurity responsibility otherwise we'll get what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left\nAnd basically militant Islam came in under\n... by law subservient to Iran or under a Hamas and Islam a job in Gaza\nObserving them or to Iraq so if you have a state that has ah most of the sovereign parts of the state but not the power of security is that a state or not a state I don't know you can argue about that that are my position I bet it very very clear\nBoth to the previous administration and to the dropping them as\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago in a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that they're two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or\nIsrael is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says now you're not willing to put the state's label the independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and get them fold civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either as citizens of Israel or the subjects of Israel but I think there is it's not an either or model I think we have a a third model at the very least which is uh basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones obscurity look in the middle east which was littered with failed states\nThat's often the best you can do and when you try to do something else you know you get a Gaza\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads side of the question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians\nEqual rights civil rights civil rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israeli citizen and what form of that tank\nWell they would have those rights in their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government have their own flag they have their own\nWell they have any of them now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin and or not loose are governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would ah endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd to think where the Palestinians are actual demanding something that would collapse their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time but they do so so I think we have to be realistic as long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and\nPockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best arrangement we could we could have and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have an overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism in a in the west bank well first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good\nUm we don't have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by us but here's how it's done\nUm uh terrorists in one of the Palestinian town and we would call up typically ... wanted to take care of it\n'cause I don't want to fund our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the within attack as we were at the un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nFind internationally final prime minister because I Know your time is very ... I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do final thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you\nIs there also a risk in being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have\nBipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel they've had a bipartisan support in I Believe will have a ... in the in the future it's a very powerful bond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that a few that we could have agreements and disagreements with ministers was for example we\nYou know it's no secret of how to disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we've signed an animal you\nAre in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements and you have a basic agreement about the importance of our lives\nPrime minister Netanyahu was always a pleasure talking with you thank you very much\nFactors do good to talk to\nIsrael's Benjamin Netanyahu we also invited Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and joined us and that invitation remains open It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News this is New Hampshire public radio seven forty seven morning [noise]\nSupport for an HBO comes from you our listeners Middleton regional health care passing the new North Country comprehensive pain centered health individuals and chronic pain management Littleton healthcare dot org and northeast credit union offering financial products and services for members since Nineteen thirty six information and joining an NBC you done one\nOf these guys and a hamster today some showers here and they're sixty or passing showers or possible tonight overnight temperatures and you're fifty\nTuesday some rain in the lower sixties\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the alliance for a lifetime income\nA nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement\nMore alliance for lifetime income dot org\nOffering new products in every store\nAnd new episodes of the original pod cast theories inside Trader Joe's\nAt apple pie cash or where pod cast are available more at Trader Joe's dot com\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin voters in Iraq's three Kurdish region's went to the polls yesterday to elect a new regional parliament this part of Iraq has been semi autonomous since the U.S led a no fly zone banned the Nineteen nineties to protect the Kurds from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein\nAnd his interest joins us now from the Kurdish city adds to the ...\nGene I understand there are no official results yet that any indication as to what new Kurdish parliament could look like\nFor the most part Rachel it's going to be this status ... you know there are two main parties here that has existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing\nEven exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people and it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nP.
