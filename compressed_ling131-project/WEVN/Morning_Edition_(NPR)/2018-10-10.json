on to suffer serious mental problems like dementia there's more from NPR's Richard Harris\nRichard Langford is sixty three year old retired minister who lives with his mother in east Nashville, Tennessee he says his medical saga began a decade ago\nIn two thousand eight hours when in because I was playing tennis with the un a besides the euro and uh he beat mob but and so I wanted\nFresh nice to help me so I better\nBut after that routine knee surgery Lankford developed a lung infection which sent him to the intensive care unit he had developed sepsis a life threatening condition sometimes called blood poisoning and all he remembers from his delirious weeks in the hospital was near death experience\nAsked saw during ... asked us how on the other side of a river it looks like the original lied Shia\nA larger profit who's miracles included resurrection of the dead his mother leader says at one point hospital staff were so sure he would die overnight they didn't even bother to pass on his medical chart to the ...\nThe thing that's amazing is his talking to us and he is like being aware of what we were saying and yet then not knowing and not remembering any of that but I Would say it what we were at the rehab I bat for weeks\nNow a decade later Richard Langford says he's still struggling to work its way out of a ticket that's physical emotional and cognitive though he's still reached the New Yorker and remains active in politics he says sometimes he feels like he's lost in a vast forest\nAnd it is seen earth shattering and there's the the water is is a big

very well working brain and they leave critical care not\nThey can't balance a checkbook they can't find the names of people at a party and they get very embarrassed that he starts socially secluded in themselves are patients tell us what a misery this form of dementia is\nIt permanent it's permanent\nIn some we've been following people for over ten years now from the brain ICU study which we did here at Vanderbilt and many of them a decade out still have elements of the dementia\nOverall he estimates that a third improve a third stay the same and the third end up on a slow decline for many the mental damages akin to a traumatic brain injury re Alzheimer or even sometimes are farmers itself\nThese problems are linked to the degree of leery um people experience well in the ICU ... says\nEvery day you're delirious you have about thirty five percent increase risk of this dimension so if you do the math on that three days of delivery him you got a almost a sure thing that you're going to have some elements of the dementia\nHe can't say exactly why the leery of leads to dementia but elite has develop strategies to sharply reduce delivery him in his ICU we have a separate story about that later today on all things considered and available online\nBut for those patients who are already facing these issues it's more than just about memory and focus Joanna starlings a clinical pharmacist is part of the team at the clinic that sees these patients\nUnfortunately a lot of the patients and their family members have depression anxiety ... disorder and cognitive impairment\nThese

U.S interests forward at the United nations what does change your mind about her well I voted against\n'em then governor Nikki Haley because she had very little virtually no foreign policy experience\nA and she did not impress me and her confirmation hearing is having the relevant experience to be our lead spokes person at the United nations\nI after watching her performance and engaging with her regularly over several months\nI actually called her and said I made an I'd made a mistake that I thought on human rights and an standing up to Russia She was a bright spot in the Trump administration's foreign policy team of course I disagree with a number of the things that Trump Administration has done in foreign policy\nAnd she did carry forward a number of the president's America First initiatives at the un up but she ended up being a much more forceful voice on American values in particular human rights than I initially had expected\nAcknowledging that you made a

S.\nThe Dodgers have long had a very rich pipeline to the Caribbean and to Cuba and one document that we cited in the in the article they at some point had an internal ranking system of just how corrupt some of their own scouts were\nAs I executive editor John Wertime says that at one point the Dodgers called one of their own employees unbelievably corrupt or if I'm told me that in order to get access to a top baseball talent in Cuba teams often go through agents called boost counties\nThe ... the middleman based in Latin America who essentially takes equity stakes in prospects sometimes it can be forty fifty sixty percent of future earnings but for prospects desperate enough that's you know it's a risk to undertake\nAnd now it might be a legal risk according to Sports Illustrated the Justice Department is investigating whether some teams broke federal corruption lost to sign Cuban players\nExtraction of Cuban players has always been shrouded in mystery in baseball but this evidence that the FBI was presented with and we were as well indicates that ah that the complicity runs potentially could teams and agents as well as the middle man the ... that have always been implicated in this\nAnd it is it basically impossible for a baseball player in Cuba to find his way into the the major leagues without help from one of these middle man\nIt's very difficult part of that is\nBecause of the embargo with Cuba and a player must establish residency in another country usually in the Caribbean or Mexico before coming to the U.S [noise] so what you have is a network of the street level agents that really have been operating outside of anything that the u._s. or major league baseball has ... over\n[laughter] so you obtained these documents that are ... you say offer a window into how baseball teams operate in Latin America especially in Cuba can you explain what you found him what it says\nWe were given a hundreds and hundreds of pages of documents that were also turned over to the the FBI this dossier what it shows is that teams and agents have what seems pretty clear from the documents any way on a level of complicity and in some cases that's scouts on the take and in some cases that is about helping\nTo arrange documents using outside counsel to essentially falsified documents and one does think that this is something that could implicate teams and and major league baseballs and institution which is something that hasn't really happened before this is the first time so far as we can tell where you have this level of documentation\nClearly I mean as you've articulated this has been somewhat of an open secret for for generations really but now that you have the documents that allegedly show some of this a dubious recruiting behavior do you watch these players on these games differently\n[noise] it's interesting as applied with this information you do watch the games and some of these players differently you realize that the story of the extraction is often a lot more complex than if perhaps portrayed as being and you also wonder about the economics that again a lot of these players are not operating under the standard\nRates for agents you know four or five percent agent fee is not applying in a lot of these cases and to me one thing you think about it is just how many people along the way how many institutions even have profited by these players making it to the major leagues\nDone where time of sports\nJohn thanks for sharing your reporting on this anytime Thanks Rachel and this is NPR News\n... point three W.

sociology professor Sharon Potter says older generations might remember talks for incoming college freshmen\nWe have a play and ... and we can't go and they went out and and he made and then we went in and how did he make\nThe problem says Potter is that only a small percentage of men are perpetrators Potter says a more productive approach is to train bystanders how to identify someone who may be

support a tax on its main products\nVerbal sin says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing wrong in which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason
