B. U. R. has had to do this I'm\nA ... there were some choices that could have been made whether or not you bring in a freelancer to try to cover your own station whether or not you don't report on it and simply allow the story to\nQuote unquote leak or to other outlets in this one that did leak to the union leader immediately from from somebody so um\nI I'm not sure there were ... I'm not sure there's a a textbook to follow we did the best we could based on what we had what we knew and always with the listener in mind with the audience in mind about how we can best serve them well will tell us about the investigation you referenced what are you referring to their\nShort so late May of this year all staff email goes out from a New Hampshire board of trustees board chair a Marshall row and then this all staff email announces that investigation had been carried out by an attorney in outside investigator interviewed eleven currents and three former employees\nAnd the results of this investigation according to marshal row were quote serious management human resources and\nCommunication issues that was what was contained in this email a there was no explanation of what that actually meant what are serious management human resources and communication issues but that was sort of the the summary uh that was provided to employees\nLater that day all staff email from Betsy gr della CEO I'm saying uh you know she's committed to making New Hampshire public radio a better place to work a consultants was hired a Melinda ... ah to the tuna forty thousand dollars and she was brought in a to improve the station climate and work with top management\nUm it's worth reiterating here that there were no financial improprieties found a new sexual harassment claims nothing illegal regarding Betsy guard Ella uh and then from from there we've been sort of watching this process play out\nOver the summer of ... the consultant was brought in there have been um trainings carried out at the station there have been these interviews to that have taken place\nA with employees\nAnd then last Wednesday or there was an offsite board meetings and this was September twenty six and the the board of trustees voted unanimously to accept the terms of ... his retirement\nAnd then a few days later over the weekend Betsy ... cleared out her her office uh\nMorning this Monday morning when staff arrived to find you know door closed lights off paintings off the wall and this and this empty desk I'm from there or you know eventually press releases were sent out that morning by the radio station and by the board of trustees and an article [noise] excuse me up here in the union leader and um\nAnd that afternoon in each pair published its own story on the topic\nAnd Todd you've been reporting on on this and you spoke with Marshall wrote a chairman of an HP ours board about the timing of ... an ounce announcement here's what Marshall row had to say\nThis was completely or decision at as a state she's thinking about it for a number of months number of months and she concluded based on her personal situation that this was the right timing and we\nIncluded a once we really understood the strength of the management team in place and uh the the ability of the station to function well a without her presence that uh we were comfortable with it\nAnd on the timing issue\nIt's worth noting that um the station just completed a five million dollar\nA capital campaign what we're calling an innovation campaign that just wrapped up ... in her all staff email said she had recently a well known reminded staff that you'd recently remarried a a man who lives in works in Massachusetts and so this issue of uh the explanation at least ... was that the timing was right\nFor guard Ella but obviously I'm the situation just appeared strange and so we we did we ask grow this question\nSo then is her retirement you sort of at this moment related than in any way to the staff complaints in the investigations and the consultant I mean it's hard to not equate that to\nKnow this this decision was based on her personal circumstances and uh I think it also ties into the completion of the campaign\nSo [noise] pardon me that's the boards message that this was a a personal decision and you know uh okay so a personal decision that one could conclude that you know the decision to clean out her office over over the weekend I guess ah say goodbye to the staff by email not not in person\nOr that that that is not the way I'm past\nAn HP our presidents have left I I've I've I've heard from my colleagues so have you in speaking to staff spoken about this element the manner in which she has she had departed and sort of surprised people Monday morning\nYou know I think there certainly was some confusion um I you know the staff was well aware of this investigation so I think the staff um you know we're we're able to make their own conclusions about uh how ... left and [noise] you you know in in hindsight I'm\nWas this major donor event or just a few days before\nThis offsite board meeting the state of the station a state of the station events where we sort of celebrated our major donors who helped\nComplete this five million dollar capital campaign and in hindsight it isn't clear ... like our della perhaps didn't choose that moment to announce her retirement here she was being celebrated the station was being celebrated for completing this major initiative and it it is a positive for the station and\nUh she had the opportunity to sort of addressed major donors and staff at that moment and yet um it was the announcement wasn't made then it was sort of made in this uh\nYou know you know a ... a few days later and then um\nHer departure you know over the weekend so well what about an HP our leadership now we've got some in term a leadership in place or what can you tell us about that short so the the board has tapped or current board member a mark Kaplan\nIn December and as they have for decades or you know or or rather you know a bill Gardner will be one of the candidates and of course there's common minnow stern challenging him\nCome in western let loose on gardener in an op ed this week uh Paul did you see that are bad and if so what do you think\nI did listen vanostran it's been very critical of the way guard has been running the secretary of state's office uh this is we've never seen this before we'd never seen a public very open transparent\nElection for secretary of state usually it's something that just happens after a normal election when the four hundred and twenty four lawmakers here in New Hampshire\nVote on the secretary of state bill gardeners one Twenty one or twenty two elections in a row idling on forty two year yeah forty two year 'cause there are two year terms uh but it's very different situation we're in this time a vanostran very critical of God or not only for support those two\nBills that are now last year in New Hampshire that a\nVoter eligibility laws but also for the white gardeners run the department of it you know ... ... says it's time for some changes\nAnd he's been very vocal about this as he can't as he campaigns again we've never seen a campaign before a part of that has been\nTaking to ah taking to the media in an op ed in criticizing how gardeners run the department it was funny a day or two later or the number to uh uh uh the number two the gardeners deputy had I had an op ed in the Concord Monitor pushing back on calling into strings\nCriticism so again this is uncharted water we've never had a very vocal very transparent election for secretary\nState what's interesting is in other states or this particular position is often an elected position so you've got the voters you have more than ... yes you have a more traditional campaigns around who's going to be secretary of state yes ... it was very critical saying that there hadn't been a true audit of the organization of the of the ... of the office\nYou know this he he feels like the transparency argument is an argument that you can make there's make there's been some unhappiness around among town clerk's over some of the decision making and I think he's trying to to to harness that that energy you know he he chairs this organization free in New Hampshire which is\nGetting involved in the midterms in ... I I my assumption is the idea is to to help Democrats\nOr get into the state house and then in turn he would get the ah their border support so that's I think that's kind of strategy a we also have a Manchester democratic Republican representative Peter solvent as a candidate as well and I think they're going to them are going to debate in Hanover bill gardener I think has declined or any invitation to debate\nGardeners out even in Carter's doing what he always does which is not campaigning Colorado's there is actually running a campaign like he's running for Congress or governor he's fundraising as you just mentioned where it's Gardner is going about it just the way he always has over the last four decades\nSo let me ask you this Paul or maybe you know dean\nUh our if going into stern is trying to to support candidates who might vote for him for secretary of state in December are there any candidates who are out there saying right now yes if I'm elected to the state legislature I Will vote for calling Ben stern so both for me is that is that it is that a pitch point that's working with voters\n... I don't think it's it's sort of that direct and that are on the surface I think it's more just you know it's it's you know it's a it's a bit of a gamble because there's no guarantee\nA because it is this kind of indirect process in which you know you help Democrats get elected and then the the the\nThinking is Democrats within a return the favor by voting for secretary of state there's no guarantee that that's going to happen it is a bit of a gamble and I think he knows that\nUm but it's probably the best you can do in terms of strategy when you're not actually trying for direct election so no chance of your question not that I'm aware of um but he certainly I think is hoping that through free and for a New Hampshire eat and kind of continue to be a relevant part of the debate\nLast a political question for for you both a President Obama endorsed a slew of candidates this week uh twenty five fellow Democrats in New Hampshire that can make a big difference for these candidates Paul\nIt doesn't hurt it's nice to have the president's endorsement the former president's endorsement but um you know I I I expected or it may help a little bit with a you know a energizing Democrats or to get out to the polls especially if they try to take back the state Senate and the state house\nYeah there was a tweeted list of about a hundred and eighty candidates and I think twenty states so this is part of a much larger a you know a move by Obama to to endorse candidates endorsements are are you know they're a good thing to have I don't know that they're they're often make the difference but ah I'm assuming that that these folks will be happy to have it\nYeah now he came here and actually campaign was ... that would be a different story but we don't expect that right now that's an interview I bet you like yeah I Would never had a chance to interview don't either\nThis is the weekly New Hampshire news round up on the exchange on in each PR\nAnd this is New Hampshire Public Radio's fall fund drive we've got just nine and a half hours left and the driver looking to raise another thirty seven thousand dollars you can help us with that maybe ten Fifteen twenty dollars a month\nTo help pay for the news you trust and the programs you love here on New Hampshire public radio I'm Rick ... here with a reporter Robert rubber we love to hear for you this morning give us a call at eight eight eight eight oh five six four seven seven or you can make your contribution all mine just two minutes at an H.

New Hampshire women's foundations fourteenth annual women building community lunch in October twenty third in Manchester\nYeah that that is typically a once this hurdle that we're going to see in less than an hour now wants his hurdle is cleared usually that means that the final vote is it done but it isn't written in stone\nSo there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line and I will say that that like I said is quite rare we are expecting some people including a you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we date it's one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural though today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I Wonder\nIf you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this air of of disagreement but then he senators\nWas tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up ... not knowing that there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president on from just about any voters any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so it seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills\nThey passed an essay but they'll they they are doing those basic pieces of governance but\nAs soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting to the basics of government on question is if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington Scott Davis so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this for re have Grassley I think a Dianne Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford\nFor many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have gone I Know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will that lasts the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years for example somebody pointed out that anonymous uh op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I remember I remember that I actually remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of attention within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race from mid summer until now and a lot of people see the cabin off fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling a under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nAssault even under the lower standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this cases even worse than that Dr Florida then vice other witnesses to the events so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to corroborate there for the reasons this\nA reasonable prosecutor couldn't bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy\nThe preponderance of evidence standard end the call so we have thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background in addition to the prior six FBI fall\nFeel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who have known judge Kevin all his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation that we received are more than twenty committee staff members have more night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members\nThe FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirmed\nWhat we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know these on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by\nA judge Kavanaugh and neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations they're also know contemporary contemporaneous evidence this investigation found no hand of misconduct\nAnd the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service nothing an investigator including career FBI special agents does ever being good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition\nTo judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominate\nThere is simply no reason then to the judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us\nThe Democratic strategy used against judge Kavanaugh has made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair and ... the process is\nThirty one years ago\nThe Senate Democrats\nTreatment as Robert Bork\nOr playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent\nHas become sort of listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote\nOn the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not would probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh as being port which is the way the conservatives refer to this Nina Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nWell I actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert ... nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how Bork fared and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily bacon\nHave some ads against him and they were chump change compared to what the money to spend today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of being me [noise] um but\n... views it turned out he answered the questions quite forthrightly he didn't have very strong and he had very strong views and quite as it turned out in the view of many Americans and their senators extreme view this\nCase Kavanaugh has pulled his punches quite deliberately are not quite said what does the U.S because actually\nCorrect so bored for example said he's sticking to his you that the one person one vote decision was wrong\nKavanaugh or would not really express his views on almost anything he he would always say that's Supreme Court precedent um I I as a judge had to follow the Supreme Court precedent or things like that so\nE.

P. R. dot org or post on our Facebook page\nAt an HP are exchange all one word\nSo Bob when we talk about the mental side of baseball what are we talking about exactly\nYeah that's you know and and that's an important question because people trying to take it for granted like and even some of the players don't know what it is so uh you know with the three areas of performance when it comes to dealing with a lead athletes are all ... athletes at any level there's physical fundamental and mental\nPlayers often find it easy to work on the physical and fundamental side the mental side compose is comprised of\nYour thoughts your actions your feelings goal setting journal ing confidence uh anxiety learning\nProperly using imagery as a tool to improve performance\nSo you know as you mentioned a prior to coming on the show we talked with thoughts become things and if players in those scenarios that you mentioned at the opening\nIf a player thinks that they're going to fail they're probably going to fail a and so we try to mental skills coaches really try to help the players think the right things that the right time so that they can give themselves the best chance to perform and that given moment\nMhm so is a mental skills coach kind of like a therapist\nYeah yeah exactly absolutely there's a comparison to that for sure I think you know we always in the field have always tried to figure out what's the best name title for this position um you know performance enhancement coach mental skills coach sports psychology coach\nUm but it's like baseball counselor is essentially what I feel like I Am because\nYou know I've talked to the minor league players about breaking up with their girlfriends and players about boundaries with parents and coaches dealing with you know their own little drinking problems are being away from their\nFamily and then and then performance of being on the field so we do the same type of work or were master's level level certified so I I don't have a PHD I Can't call myself a psychologist [noise]\nUm but I I have a masters in sports psychology and counseling so essentially you're right it is kind of like being a baseball therapist\nAnd it's easy to sort of imagine that ball players especially when we see close up shot to them on TV that they just look so confident and in the moment and ready to perform but they're human beings they've got lives off the field and it's easy for them to bring their lives off the field\nTo the field just like we could bring our lives outside of work into work\nYeah I mean that I think there's a perception of you know fancy players in a certain way they see 'em\nYou know as as players just like it's like we will get actors you know Denzel Washington or Tom Hanks or whatever it is we see them and characters like\nWe know who they are but they play that character and I think athletes are the same way we we know them as the ball player but we don't know him as the person so I tell guys baseball's what you do it's not who you are\nAnd ah and that's what they do and they have negative thoughts they get anxious before games they\nThink they're never going to get another hit I'd pall mall or the nights leading\nAll time high pleading hit on the hit list or asked them what time do you ever lose confidence and he said yeah if I'm all for twelve not having any hits and twelve that that's I feel like I'm never going to get another hit and that's Paul mall at our hall of famer so if he's having those thoughts you know that everyone's having those thoughts\nWow so it takes a mental some mental health I guess to to get out of a slump like that and let me ask you about what things were like ah for mental health and baseball when you started um you were drafted in Nineteen eighty one and you you you started with the Yankees in Nineteen eighty six\nWhat was professional baseball like back then with respect to mental health and mental skills catching\nWas none [laughter] so it was it was something that ah\nI I did a radio interview the other day in St Louis actually and and they mentioned that and and I could use that as being you know I'm from a small town in New Hampshire Salisbury New Hampshire went to ... Valley High school you know we had\nA couple of hundred maybe two thousand people in our in our town and I go to New York I'm playing and living in you know New Jersey I'm commuting over the George Washington bridge and playing in New York I'm\nLike you know we're not in Kansas anymore you know like the wizard of Oz so it was really hard I Would have helped me a lot but there were no teams that had those positions then it slowly started in the late eighties gain some traction\nAnd since two thousand four has gone ah to where we live about twenty seven teams who have somebody's ... providing this resource for the players and so it's gaining in popularity now yeah yeah and and the reason for that Peter's because you know the the ownership no one really it it's such a\nYou don't know if that helps players because it's not a tangible thing you can't you can see a guy that puts on twenty pounds and get stronger you can see a guy that changes as mechanics\nYou don't know if this helps but it does you know you can't quantify it and I think the teams are always like why should I invest in something that I Can't quite quantify how do I know it's going to work well now as the field has grown and players are voicing how much this has helped more teams are using this resource\nYeah well you describe the scene in in this book Ninety percent mental where I Believe you were a at Portland sea dogs minor league game and you were asking the players how many among you think that your your hang ups have to do not with physical a fundamental things but with mental issues right and how many hands right now the\nI asked him I said I said uh how many players here feel like they're playing up to the potential uh none of them raised their hand and I said okay under the three following categories what is the reason why I did physical one guy raised us and fundamental one guy raised as in mental\nThey all raised their hand and then I said what are you doing about it and they all looked at me dumbfounded because they were like oh my God I and so the you know there's one thing that have the resources that's another for the players to say hey\nI might be able to use this and that's a that's a gap that I constantly work to bridge with players now I'm In a very subtle way it's a it's not an easy job really because you're trying to\nHelp players that have already had a lot of past success they make a lot of money they have a lot of people telling them what to do and I'm just another resource so I have to kinda sit back and and wait and the minor leagues I can be much more proactive as I was that day with the Portland sea dogs but in the big leagues a little bit different\nOkay we're talking with a former major league are about to experience is also a mental skills coach or for the San Francisco giants he worked with the Boston Red Sox for a long time as well what questions do you have\nAbout major league baseball it's mental aspect in particular but also Bob's career he spent Thirteen Years in the majors he's actually a one of the the apparently Bob in ... in your book you wrote fewer than or around two thousand people have spent more than a decade in the major size is it's a pretty elite club given how many people want to play prevents\nYou out of the Nineteen only Nineteen thousand plus I've ever played that one day in the big leagues in a hundred and thirty five years and the only yeah less than two thousand have played ten years so\nI'm Still quite an opportunity to ask a former major league or your question about baseball give us a call the number is one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven one eight hundred eight nine to\nAn HP are you can also send an email to exchange it an H.

I. T. N. H. dot org [noise]\nThis is an HP are\nThis is the exchange on H. P. R. Peter below filling in for ... and we're speaking today with Bob to spray who pitched in the majors from Nineteen eighty six\nTo Nineteen Ninety eight for six different major league teams you then went on to serve as mental skills coach for the Boston Red Sox and now serves in that capacity for the San Francisco giants his new book is called Ninety percent mental an all star player turned mental skills coach revealed the hidden game of baseball\nAnd we're happy to take your questions and calls give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to\nSix four seven seven uh we get an email question from bill who ah who wanted to know a Bob ... players talking to opponents while they're on base or these conversations friendly banter or an opportunity to sort of chide or jibe with the other guy looks friendly and funny most of the time but is it\nYeah it is now and it's something you talked about a crusade to question the old school guys would never talk to the opposing player you'd run in different directions when I came up\nYou ran toward the outfield you never ran to the middle of the field where you might run into an opposing player or that bothers a lot of old timers now coaching players are out there talking before the game and hugging everybody and\nAnd uh so it's usually somebody that they they if they're Latin American player they played together with him and winner ball they may play together in the fall league somehow they're connected [noise]\nUm so yeah it's all cordial it's fun um and uh but\nIt's something that some people don't like [laughter] okay so ... not not trying to play ... a mental games with each other while they're on base now now now they're just yeah yeah okay uh let's go you've on north sudden you've on thank you very much for calling what's your question or comment\nRed Sox fan and I'm Wondering if the difference here is mental attitude more than skills which they already had\nHigh I appreciate the question um yeah they I think it's residual effects from my being there for Fifteen what I think there was\n... years and I think that there is to your point I think they they do have a from what I've heard they do have a pretty relaxed atmosphere joy corps done a great job with his staff or ... been a long time bullpen guys very very smart I'm Glad he's the pitching coach he's very\nUh uh he'd be I'm Glad he's in that position because he's more than a bullpen coach so I think you know culture and chemistry does come into play or they are different uh John had a different style of managing and connecting with the players and I think\nYou're seeing the the Latin players and the young players really uh feel more comfortable around the staff that they have and I think court could be responsible for that\nAnd we got a call from Dan in Concord Dan thanks for calling\nTalk of buying thanks for the opportunity I I was curious about a whack elite athletes go through when they're injured for or have had surgery for a long time how is it different from\nYou know is it different from just normally having to be um um red alert and determined to get back um and do you encounter you know you ... athlete or who were injured and wondering whether they're ever going to make it back and need to do\nYeah thanks than a that is or when you're injured on the team you feel like you have a scarlet letter on your head loser I'm big el because you feel like you're not part of the team\nAnd you feel like your teammates you kind of project that out do you feel like your teammates see you in that way and what I tell the players that are injured as the ... you know when you were playing did you look at the end you're player that way and they said no and I said why he's though because I have my own stuff going on\nAnd I said well that's the same thing now they're not worried that you're injured that you're a but what you need to do is focused on getting better and the the anxiety that comes from players that are trying to come back depending on the significance of the injury is real there's a lot of anxiety there's a lot of trepidation there's there's\nA strong hurdles that they have to go through a over time and and I think that I tell players that are injured there's there's three types of time there's baseball time time on the clock and then there's God's time\nIn God's time will determine when you come back you know it's you can't rush things and the players are really impatient because they they don't like being hurt and not being part of the team be they're afraid they're going to lose their job\nAnd that means a lot of money in some cases so all of those things are are the full spectrum for the injured player\nMhm let's talk to rich in Concord rich thank you very much for calling\n[laughter] [noise] yeah Hi thanks for having me and I bought my wife very much very much enjoy doing jazz or size\nLo o lo or is there no thank you rich [laughter]\nUm yeah my question is I I'm\nA little older now but I have done long distance running in my in my life I've even without tracking with a couple thoughts that made it the Olympics the thing that I find is that I can get excited about seeing my self improve for a while you know a year or two\nBut then it's like how do you a stay at such a high level or work past just getting border you know it's the same thing and and may not see the improvement there for a while and that's where I find I lose it\nAnd get more disinterested in and yeah and not gain by\nMy goals well motivation is you know as you get older it becomes difficult to sustain that level of ability I think resetting you know I Would say the quick thing would be to reset your goals so they become more [noise]\nHelp motivation and motivation is what you need it sounds like when you get bored with what's going on um as as we age as athletes you know that we're not going to be able to perform the same way we once did but our mind is always the you know twenty year old athlete and things we can do anything and that's\nThat's why people at my age you know the get injured playing Thanksgiving Day football or pick up basketball is because our bodies aren't used to taking that [noise]\nBut ah so the quick part of that and I'm not sure if I'm answering your question correctly but uh you know resetting goals finding new motivation and and maybe having a different expectation of what you feel like you should be doing versus what you what you really can do\nLots of great questions from listeners in have we welcome more if you've got them the phone number to call one eight hundred eight nine to\nSix four seven seven uh we've been talking a little bit this morning about a statements that sort of re center you mentally or for for for the game we talked about um thoughts are becoming things and we get this question from Wendy who asked\nA Bob de your techniques work for sports other than baseball or are they baseball specific\nUh there for any athlete there for any person any athlete I think\nI've had a a a grand dad for lacrosse player at the University of Virginia or email me and say is is ... ... well this book helped my daughter even though it's baseball and absolutely because of the reason is I talk about the aspects related to performance\nThat you can put under any team or any individual sports team sport concentration confidence using breathing as a tool using imagery as a tool so those are all things that can be applied to other sports are absolutely\nUh we got a question from Greg in Salisbury Bob Bob how do you feel about ah the pressure that is put on kids to focus on a particular sport or and then a follow up question did you play more than one sport in their ... high school\nI did a I played basketball I played soccer for a little bit but basketball and baseball mostly um I don't like the pressure that's being applied to the children now um I understand you know the the new programs all the way through or are\nThe programs that you know they're not going to go away I think but I uh I think players athletes young athletes need to sample different sports they shouldn't specialize until they become late teens may be their last year in high school if they have a career past that\nUm you know I think one of the things that I read the other day that I'm a certain percentage of the first picks and the NFL Draft or multiple player multiple sport athletes\nUh colleges in teams look for the athletes now that played multiple sports because of such things like burn out and overuse especially with pictures a pitcher's those guys that log a lot of innings and as their youth in through college or the ones that are more susceptible to Tommy John injuries\nWhich are starting to happen earlier and earlier so\nUh I think it's a as a whole thing on education the ... of the parents about why do they play specialized sport what's the end result\nAnd not only is it costs but it's also cost and time for the family but it also does put pressure on the kids\nAre we've got a call from bill in where Neal thanks for calling\nGood morning thanks for taking my call Bob it's a pleasure to talk with you Hi Bill and I'm curious if a a a pitcher looking back on and on a finished career with a wall full of awards and accolades how he drank\nFrom University of New Hampshire in Manchester hosting open house on October twenty to explore campus and degree programs details at Manchester ... dot edu slash open house and from a vineyard brands and borders of love the firm winds from the parent family of the southern Rhone Valley\nAvailable to New Hampshire state liquor stores on the Web as Rhone dot net\nMostly clear for tonight will have low temperatures in the thirties [noise]\nThis is at age PR\nThis is the exchange on N. H. P. R. find Peter Biello filling in for ...\nAnd we're speaking today with Bob to spray who pitched in the majors for Thirteen Years\nFor six different major league teams and then he went on to serve as a mental skills coach for the Boston Red site Red Sox know served in that capacity for the San Francisco giants his new book is called Ninety percent mental an all star player turned mental skills coach revealed the hidden game of baseball calling out with your questions or comments one eight hundred\nEight nine to six four seven seven uh we got a an email from from David in Meredith who ah was asking um my son and I wondered what is happening when a skilled and talented pitcher who pitches extremely well suddenly has a game when he struggles to get the ball over the plate\nIs this a mental issue or a mechanical issue and or a mechanical issue that has a mental impact to how how does a picture and staff address this during the game so a lot of questions they're mostly related from from David merits what do you think\n[noise] yeah that's a a sexually question do I I think that it could be both um sometimes it's a mechanical issue it's a flaw or\nA player may have something that a picture may have something that he was doing that it can't quite correct so the dialogue in that case would be the role of the pitching coach saying who got to keep your body closed or go to\nDrive you know stay back over the ...\nA pitch down the middle to the center I'm going to give up runs that's their narrative so so if it's mechanical thing and the guys experience what am I doing wrong okay I can I can correct is making just meant and then things go into play\nUm the pitch if it's a mechanic if it's a mental thing to start with laughter confidence you know sometimes this happens when the first guy that they face reaches base\nAnd now they get anxious about oh my God I got a picture of the guy on first and then so it becomes a mental so both of those cycles happened I think the the goal of the pitching coach is to identify mechanical issues\nAnd often times the players won't their internal narrative is different than the external narrative and so they won't tell the pitching coach that am afraid today I I have no confidence I think I'm going to it\nYou know really stink he's never going to say that but if a player has anchors and that's where a case where I Would help them develop anchors breathing routines things that would help them regain focus\nSo that he changes the narrative and then he goes on and pitches\nIt's astounding how much power a mental block can have you you write in this book about one picture and I forget his name who just all of a sudden couldn't find the strike zone like not even close and it in a ruined his career right do you remember who am I speaking about\nA false Steve Blass having ... killed I mean there's ... there's been a few\nYeah the throwing issues that quote unquote ... I don't know if that's a great term for but people are athletes throwing athletes baseball players softball player sometimes getting those funk where they just can't throw it's like the their uh\nTheir arm their hand is somebody else's hand and that's something that I've actually talking with a couple of players about now\nThat have that it's a really a tough thing to overcome but not really sure the orientation of it uh there's no quick fix to it but it's certainly a an area that mental skills people can help deal with the anxiety and and the the frustration of that\n[noise] ah yeah I remember you also wrote about Chuck now block right the second basement and I remember watching him or in the in the late nineties I think he's playing for the Yankees at the time second base very close to first base for those of you who aren't baseball fans and it's a short throw relatively speaking\nHe kept missing these thrill is yeah and I kept thinking ... missing these throws this is like a little league thing but maybe it was a mental block\nWas deaf and that's why he went to the outfield and and uh because of that because he couldn't throw that so it is it there is a mental block their unlocking that is is proven to be difficult\nYeah so you as a pitcher you weren't known for your your speed not necessarily but you've known for your accuracy and you could get pretty reliably put a ball wherever you wanted it why why was that important\nFor you because I didn't throw hard you know right now if you throw Ninety five Ninety eight you can afford to make mistakes over the plate will say because you're faster than the editor's response\nI threw in the hitting speed so in order for me to have success I had to be able to pinpoint\nMy pictures with accuracy which started back to my childhood in Salzburg throwing balls against the schoolyard wallet solves Salisbury elementary school you know I've always working on throwing at targets because I had to uh that's how I Survived\nDeath in practice to to find find the plate and to have a few reliable pitches yeah there's one scene in this book I absolutely loved it I think you were working with a minor league team in us that the pitchers how many pitches do you have yeah someone raised his hand and said for uh maybe it wasn't you have someone else that this team is working\nNo it was I was that was you know I was when I was a player it was when you were a player and tests\n... we were doing a discussion on pitching and the pictures that he had four pitches\nAnd it goes really and he goes if you can get up and throws you know seven out of ten pitches over the plate will call consider that a pitch will put it in your back pocket so needless to say the guy didn't through his fastball over the plate seven out of ten times so but he had four pitches\nAnd so that's where it gets back to my command I could come in my fastball which made my other pitches better\nYeah a euro I there's a passenger that I really want to quote because it's it it seems to summarize how important it is to to have conviction but also a good\nA good country and pitches and your back pocket and she writes a filthy fastball can make things easier because it allows the pitcher to miss spots and still get people out but it's a two part approach the physical part a step to in the process step one happens upstairs before picture winds up to throw the ball\nHe must determine what pitch he's gonna throw next into which location to the plate and once that part is finalized the conviction must be there to throw it only then when the conviction is forged in stealing resolve either physical odds of throwing a strike to decide location greatly increased conviction plus execution\nMm yeah hey that's that's pretty cool [laughter] have you read that really well I should have had you read the the audio for me I I think that you know we have a saying the ball knows when you throw a pitch with conviction\nIt seems like the ball in those because you can make a bad pitching get hitters out when you throw a ball would timidity and fear\nThose are the ones that get hit it's like the ball and those so you have to be able to have conviction and your picture pitches you have to trust your first thought and that takes and that takes preparation you know you have to know what you're doing I think now we can get into this whole other subject about analytics and pitch counts and all that stuff but\nPlayers today have so much information given to them that they often don't understand why and I think understanding the why you're going to throw a certain pitch is really important and it helps with the conviction\nEspecially because you can sort of imagine that a hitter is trying to predict what you're going to throw next and I I read somewhere years ago that mark McGuire\nA sort of can predict that with eighty five percent accuracy and that was why he was so good as the hitter sure someone's pitcher you sort of have to play this what you call a cat and mouse game yeah he knows that I Know that you never know what you're going to throw next right how do you predict that\nWe've got a call from Stefan or I Hope I'm pronouncing you write your name correctly Stefan in God's Tom thank you very much for calling what's your question\nYeah thanks for taking my call I'm going to ask you about probably like I didn't really think that my mind where mental lapse was great talking to the base when I'm\nOut in how to coach a player [laughter] probably\nTen you know obviously it was all thing um because he was able to do that for years before and then all of a sudden like fog rolling in he just couldn't do it anymore so out of the coaching allow that continue and not just pull 'em and then work on his confidence or or mental\nAh well I'm not sure what the Yankees I'm a you know reasons for that word but I Would say initially you're paying them a lot of money um\nIf you if you are so that's that's not a reason but it is and the big leagues you're paying this guy you expect him to go out you think it might go away if you just keep playing them if you put them on the disabled list a and then you'd have to bring somebody else up\nYou know does that help 'em or does that hurt him I I think that the whole issue with the not the inability to throw is is so complicated that no one really knows\nHe went to the outfield Chuck Knoblauch actually went to the outfield so why the Yankees sounds like ... a big Yankee fan and why the Yankees continued to let that happen I have no idea um maybe for the entertainment of the fans", "show_name": "Weekly NH News Roundup", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "05"}
