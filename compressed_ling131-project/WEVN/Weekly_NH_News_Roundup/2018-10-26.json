ESPY three and it was all over the news this week that's the controversial law that some say made it harder for certain groups of people like college students and homeless people or to register to vote or close to election day\nAdvocates say the law plug the gaps in the state's election law made it harder for people to cast fraudulent votes or this week Hillsborough County superior court judge Kenneth brown ruled against the law sing imposes edition\nSo that's where the fight began but they may be can unpack the sort of timeline for from this week because ... show that that decision was on Monday what was the rationale behind that decision\nWill the rationale behind the decision a chick elated by the judge in his order\nWas a that he was more convinced by the arguments of the league of women voters in the state Democratic Party\nThat the wording of this affidavit that the voters without identification would be asked to sign was was complicated was difficult to follow entire election lines and was unnecessary because\nThe judge said he was not convinced by the state's arguments that such measures were needed to offset the danger of a fraudulent voting the judge was not convinced that there was a real problem\nA big enough to be solved by the measures\nThat were proposed in the law but it's important to note that this was only a ruling on a temporary injunction to forestall implementation of the law a pending a full trial on the merits so it's not like the law was struck down right it was just we are going to put it on hold for now because we have to have a trial so if this is unresolved\nOr we shouldn't put it in effect a because the the plaintiffs have met the requirement that they have a likely enough chance of succeeding at trial\nThat we should allow the law to take effect because if we allowed to take effect and then they succeed or if that would kind of defeat the purpose of the trial [noise]\nAh so it's important though to put this in context for the uh hundreds of thousands of people who are going to go to the polls a week from Tuesday who if they're following the coverage that this might think that there's going to be mass confusion and and that hundreds of thousands of\nPeople are voting process is going to be complicated this law affects a very narrow a segment of the voting population which is those people who\nWho arrive at the polls without sufficient photo identification to establish their identity and their residency in New Hampshire and that's a you know as I've seven hundred and fifty thousand votes that were cast in two thousand sixteen election only nine thousand people filled out those affidavit it's\nA move that are in place now they filled out a card\nThat said this is a test that I live at this location and I am this age\nUh and uh most of those people were sent a card in the mail after the election and all but seven hundred and forty were returned\nA so you know even at nine thousand people were a that may vote without proper ID we're talking about almost ... only about one percent of the voting population that's going to be affected and what this law does is it it tightens up the verification process under\nThe existing law if you go and vote without id you fill out this form and the state's sends a card to the address that you provided if you fill out that card and return it everything's fine you've been verified\nWhat the new law does is it puts the burden on the voter\nWho fills out that for them to come back within ten days with the proper identification or face a a voter fraud charges and a possible fines of up to five thousand dollars and the judge found that was just too onerous and said they need to go back to the old form where they just mail out the postcard\nOkay and I want to just added ... we've been through this law has been uh been looked at for a while now for in a variety of different contacts and\nAh originally as you mentioned if you did not comply with the requirements interests be three were subject to something like five or six thousand dollar fine uh about a year ago I think that part of the law was put on hold so as to be three was allowed to go into effect I think for the twenty set for twenty Seventeen\nUm but not the fine so now this is for the for the rest of it as well\nRight so to get back to your original question Peter about the sequence of events this week\nThrough the courts since shortly after the law was passed in the summer of two thousand Seventeen and there was a trial underway with judge temple in in Nashua\nAnd in fact there was judge temple and just before the elections in two thousand Seventeen who said well we're going to have to suspend the fines while this works its way through the courts\nAnd they would have been set up a to bring this to trial in early ah two thousand Eighteen if not for the fact that the state went out and hire an attorney who has had some prior relationship with judge temple and then he had to recuse himself\nOr earlier this year and so basically they had to start all over again and are really put themselves in a time crunch so it it when the judge a issued his injunction on Monday\nThe state uh later appealed and then yesterday or the judge a frown heard their appeal and uh they worked out some conditions that would clarify exactly how they should proceed using the older documents the state is still a dissatisfied with that they've appealed\nTo the Supreme Court of the state to essentially put a stay on the judge rounds decision and let them move forward with the new verification forms and we'll probably hear the Supreme Court ruling on that later today\nJeff you want it to counter say when I mean I I you know you when you listen to days details on this it at the irony is like if it's possible and palpable it is [laughter]\nBecause ah this is supposed to simplify things and make things easier in this process and it's become just a crazy situation now where we're down to the last two a wire in a lecture in a very important election is everybody's been saying for a long time now and what have the situation while waiting for the Supreme Court to rule perhaps this afternoon we don't know\nIt's it's just it's really it's very instructive him on health why they call like sausage making\nDuring the current compromise that they weren't out or something like you used a new form under us be three up until election day and I did I go back to the twenty sixteen form and then on top of that the secretary of state's office are they ... said well we're not going to do anything right now until we see what the Supreme Court says or does everything is basically up in the air\nI rest my case ... yeah um so I Want to bring in a a interesting voice on this particular issue because ah Durham checklist supervisor ... a said making any last minute changes to the registration process will be a challenge but\nHas to be three she says would have caused even more headaches on election day and she she by the way had testified against the law in court and\nIt's going to be some work to change change about\nSo common thing of course earlier in the week on this but it seems like the perspective on the ground at least from some people is that this is a good thing has to be three would have been a little burdensome Jeff yeah\nI think that's that's the opponents have seized on this really is this case it's kind of say look this is this this is a bill apparently had already had flaws ... you'll find was actually stayed and and now we're talking about this these other problems that that judge brown a scene in this [noise]\nUh it it it does kind of make you wonder was the state putting the cart before the horse by after seeing these rulings and has they've said earlier about you know the delay in it and are getting the lawyer and and getting their debt case set up\nWas was it really necessary to have this law take effect for this election and why were and things cleaned up first before they they decided to go with with what this law said I mean I I it I'm just saying this as as an observer of this\nYeah and it's interesting too that you know this is this particular um ah the evolution of the story this week had to do not with small technical things but with the heart of the issue right is this imposing\nAnd the world affairs counsel

P. R. exchange so ah the the Kennedys met they spoke about a variety of issues ... paid family medical leave keeps coming up\nUh and on the the debate between Molly Kelly in ... new on Wednesday night on an HP are uh they had an exchange or about paid family medical leave\nThe governor when that was that\nA bean that and it wouldn't have to have three ... three times in the house um he had a majority of his own party in the house and Senate if he wanted to put through a paid family medical leave act that was the time to do it he didn't do it he had an opportunity to do it and later\nHi governor will ensure that we do have we're created in ... I Believe when we were going to say when you give you thirty seconds to ... to ... to carry on and I want I don't want to make a ... it's not a vacation with me but it's obviously not a vacation that comment came as part of a bigger conversation of course is not a vacation that's that's silly\nI'm at the end of the day when their plan we realized it was a trap of an income tax we tried to ... ... what we tried to support that that didn't get past I don't control the whole house\nSo I'm a trap income tax according to the governor Jeff you you you want to respond to this yeah I I I find it interesting that this has become a big issue in and actually it's it's apparently Molly Kelly's main issue with me she's been going all over about this thing\nUh it was it ... the bill that uh was was debated and voted on last a term last session was basically a bill that ended up being having what they call an opt in you ... you can you as an employee you could say I want to I Want to be part of this pet family medical leave program and they would take some\nSomething out of your paycheck just like unemployment insurance that have some kind of ... funds for that\nAnd apparently what happened is that uh the ... the department of revenue administration dissent rent some numbers and they said well you know if it's opt in it's probably not going to be as financially viable\nAs it should be that when they raise questions about it and after being passed as as Senator Kelly said in the house three times it goes to the Senate and it seemed like it might be getting through the supporters when we're very optimistic about it but the governor\nWho had been pretty quiet through the sessions said he was against it and that's what what happened was that the uh the bill just you know ... did not make it and uh the the real the real concern though the real problem was that with with this up and provision it's almost like it wasn't enough\nAnd now the governor apparently is saying that he supports some kind of voluntary proposal which I haven't seen any details of really ... it's kind of this idea that he he does support it but it's not clear what he does support you know what kind of family medical leave program he does support because he said he does\nAnd he doesn't support a voluntary one but that's pretty much what the ... then was an ... and I really look at ways it's there's a difference between voluntary enough to well no it's it's an opt in his voluntary as a you have to opt into this program to be part of it\nWas initially designed and this was the heart of the governors concern is that you are automatically going to be in it and automatically have\nI don't know five to nine dollars a week to get it from your paycheck automatically unless you opt out and the provision for opting out required you to have fill out a form that would be notarized\nSo as the governor criticized it as an income tax because it would come out of your check so it's tax on your income\nOr if you did knocked out in the opt out provisions were too onerous and his view and uh using the bully pulpit to make that point these are\nThe bill was voted down even though it appeared on the glide path to passage with the governor has made clear that he supports\nA is a version that was actually proposed in committee\nOr by Republican representative and Lynn over which would essentially be a go to the private market for a short term disability insurance with help from the state uh meaning get local ensure find insurance companies are went off or short term disability or the state will help facilitate the payment of the premium and let the private insurers handle it\nOr what you're going to have then is a very expensive premiums because you know in programs like that people only buy them when they think they're going to use them and we're the only people who buy insurance or the people who are going to use it I guess what it's extremely expensive\nSo uh this is the debate a that is under way on this insurance program and in a way it's a microcosm of the debate we're having an all insurance programs whether it's health insurance short\nDo you want a mandatory program where everyone's in the pool even many people who may never used the program and therefore the costs are low for those who need it or do you want to have a program that's entirely optional where only people who needed are going to buy it and it's going to be very expensive\nBut I think the other out the other aspect of this was using a private insurance is is the is the fact that these people are losing their jobs temporarily and what happened to the employer what's the employers option what ... what is the employee here she's supposed to do when its employees out for a week two weeks a month or whatever the believe is necessary\nWhat happens is that what happened to the physician especially if you're a small businesses was but it has been a concern for a long time how would this actually work\nUh just to take a step back but you know what you heard in that particular clip it's part of a larger campaign strategy by some new to paint a mall and Kelly as a as a tax and spend or using words like income tax Molly Kelly has taken the pledge not to or not to have a sales or income tax\nIncrease but doesn't into his argued if you look at her record in the Senate that she's actually a a a a a tax and spend or that's going to be his arguments up you know more broadly speaking ... who knows you know it was in reasonably good shape use up by about ten points and each of the to the ... and the UNH poles\nOr it may be a little closer than that in the end um but it's got high approval\nOr so this is going to this is a challenge for for Mali Kelly just need some help from a blue wave I think on this one\nYeah let's let's hear a little bit of the exchange that I'm a new and Kelly had about about taxes sooner did criticize Kelly for raising taxes many times during her time in the Senate after she said that she would not support sales or income tax and then she voted to cut taxes for small businesses\nHer own words said very clearly to the teen set no when it comes to a sales and income tax I think everything should be on the table those are her words not mine so I Know it sounds convenient that now that she's running for governor oh well she is going to take the pledge of not raise those taxes but let's be fair I'm sure she didn't tell her constituents she was going to raise them fifty to sixty times when she ran for Senate but she did that\nI mean at the end of the day you have to be responsible I cut business taxes I limited the electricity consumption tacked this is how you drive business and create opportunity for individual because suicide or do you want to respond to that or\nYou know ... let me be clear once again that I Do not support and would veto it fails income tax and in a response to my opponents at um at language here about taxes you know\nEvery every time we're in a discussion I'm at and it comes it has happened to me with my opponent and certainly with the Republican Party that ah when we're not quite sure how to answer certain questions that we don't want to know how to move forward or support policy that we bring up um you know the political\nFear tactic which is taxes and it continues to be brought up all the time\nIn fact I feel that fear tactics I'd be honest I\nI Believe that our voters are tired of hearing that and I believe that voters are much smarter smarter than to continue to hear that same rhetoric which is really a complete political fear tactic\nSo um but ... says bringing up this issue this this tax issue is is a fear tactic those who seems to be saying look you see that your position a little\nBit of a perfect thing ... what I was talking about that's the Republican strategy it's a it's a tried and rude class of ... greatest is absolutely no it shouldn't be surprised about Adams I'm absolutely not get us fill in the blank for the the opponent's name and it's the same ...\nYou should be prepared for them to mine her record as a state legislator to to to be able to deal with whatever they might throw out or in that respect\nIt's interesting we we did we did a U.S up of a questionnaire with the two two major party candidates for governor and and we asked a question about business taxes and apparently a center Kelly who how at one point it said she would would uh get rid of the the in the ... in the business ... and the business enterprises facts\nShe would keep the business enterprises tax tax cuts but still would try to roll back the cuts in the business profits tax and that was you know that was an interesting change in her position that apparently was reflect a little bit slightly in this debate\nBut it it's it's it's apparent that the idea of taxes is moving issue for her she's not she's still not clear on on her positions on it and this is what\nIt's a boy it's that's a tough question you know the reality is that the ... certainly comprehensive immigration reform but immigration\nReform a general has become such a politically polarizing a issue that ah it's just very difficult to see any compromise or a on any of this and as soon as you just get these kind of repeated\nAttempts in Congress by a different different uh you know different parts of the of the house or the Senate to come up with a bill and are just getting everybody to agree and to not use it as kind of a political weapon during the election season which is a good chunk of the time these days because now we're going to get into the next presidential cycle as soon as this\nGoes over to heaven yeah it's just it's it's just become almost an impossibility and it's really driven by the by the kind of partisan makeup of Congress he didn't need one party with a significant majorities in order to really get anything done\nAnd while we had a a compromise that\nCuster alluded to him which was supported by a no less than the Republican presidential candidate\nAt the time and Senator McCain and Lindsey Graham and other prominent Republicans and the votes appear to be there a but a massive contact your congressman campaign orchestrated by anti immigration voice\nMobilized their base and that was shot down and that was the last time there was any people to Congress about immigration\nReform Jeff I'm also not it's not convinced that immigration is at the top of the agenda for typical New Hampshire voters I think there's other concerns that that are out far outweigh or this because it's not an issue that\nWe necessarily live with daily we'd do as David said you know it does affect us economically very much so but I don't think I think things more like obviously the opioid crisis us costs of health care or access to health care or other issues I think\nTo me seemed to be way more on on people's minds than than immigration which seems to be one of these giant a national uh you know what issues that may be\nAgainst it gets people riled up ... on on cable news but maybe not necessarily at the dinner table\nMhm that said let's hear from Steve Negron on this issue or a he was asked what he thinks needs to be done with immigration and he said quote Arbor over arching changes are needed\nI Believe right now we need to look at you know how do we make sure that the people coming into the border in our country whether it's through um the southern border even the northern border sea ports airports you know that that we're a land of laws um there's a right way to do it we're not doing it right now we need to get back to it\nSo Dina let me ask you are your thoughts on the CD to race at the moment sure\nA general you know I just see to it as I as I've said\nIs getting a getting a lot less attention to the news and any other races which is usually good sign for the incumbent when the races and getting a lot of coverage a customer and in most polling is up double digits or\nShe's enjoying some of the highest favorability of her career which at one point had been a little bit of an issue for her she got a big campaign war chest to she raised over four million dollars\nA you know Steve Negron has had some issues with kind of voter recognition and visibility\nUh my other I think the other concern for him is that that second CD is increasingly become more centrist even leaning slightly democratic conquered Hanover Lebanon down to keen increasingly democratic\nUh and he is not really adjusted his agenda uh to kind of meet the demographics of the district is very very conservative on climate change abortion rights\nGay conversion therapy a number of social issues that I just think uh make it a little challenging for him to to kind of a meet up with the demographics of that district so I think for that race she's in reasonably good shape [noise]\nAll right well this is the weekly New Hampshire news round up I'm Peter

visiting New Hampshire this week we'll talk about the the goings on with a Senator David would burn in the Democratic party and cost ... talk about\nEfforts to fight the way fair decision in the next few minutes or so\nBut before we do that I Want to bring in a listener comment about something that was mentioned in the last part of the show we're talking about um wages and immigration and relationship between you know immigration American workers and and they saw him and you brought up the fact that there was a popular restaurant chain\nThat um had to close because they couldn't find enough workers to operate that restaurant was nine hundred degrees and David wrote into say\nNine hundred degrees is unwilling to pay a livable wage for the Portsmouth area rent is high cost of living is high the pay was low no one could work there and survive so they chose to close instead of paying a wage they deem survivable livable for the community they chose to open up and\nEbbing Manchester has cheaper cost of living David says simple math cause and effect day what do you think of his comments\nWell a fancy restaurant has to pay wages sufficient to support a a an apartment and lifestyle in Portsmouth proper I don't think there's any restaurant that could do so except for the highest end restaurants with waiters that make tips in the hundreds of dollars a night\nOr it's the assumption not on the ... a part of a a lot of Portsmouth employers that their employees won't be living in Portsmouth that there'll be commuting there from happening in Rochester and more affordable places are but there's no question about it a Fort Smith is extremely expensive place to live\nAnd opening a business there is a an extremely expensive proposition\nThat is but it's an ongoing or a discussion I guess it's a mild way of putting it in and especially on the seat and see costs but secondly in Portsmouth the cost of housing and the inability to have a workforce that actually lives in the city 'cause it's it's almost impossible unless you have a you know really good job to be living there\nNow we got another comment from Tom in Portsmouth who said part of the reason for the state's labor shortage put that in quotes or the low end stagnant wages paid by New Hampshire employers a Tom cites a number I don't I don't know where he got this number but he says more than ... eighty thousand New Hampshire workers commute to Massachusetts to work because of higher wages paid\nIn Massachusetts so Thanks Tom for your comment really appreciate that um want to get a few more news items in

I Would ask in twenty twenty when it comes time to pick a nominee on the Democratic side for the presidency that you pick a person who has the best shot of beating Donald Trump\nNot the person in your heart that you would think would make the best president team what do you make of his campaign message that\nWill that specific or a statement about picking the person who is most likely be Donald Trump I mean that's kind of standard strategic voting there is a long history and political science that says that the that the partisans often pick the person they think is most likely to win who's most viable rather than the person in their heart who's their their true preference so so I don't know that that's not a particularly controversial thing to say\nBut with the more interesting issue with without having already is that he has made the comments are suggesting that whoever the or whoever the Democratic nominee is going to have to be prepared to to basically\nSupport for an HP our

law does is it puts the burden on the voter\nWho fills out that for them to come back within ten days or with the proper identification or face a a voter fraud charges and a possible fines of up to five thousand dollars and the judge found that was just too onerous and said they need to go back to the old foreign where they just mail out the postcard okay\nYeah I wanted to just added ... we've been through this law has been uh been looked at for a while now in a variety of different contacts and\nAh originally as you mentioned if you did not comply with the requirements interests be three were subject to something like five or six thousand dollar fine uh about a year ago I think that part of the law was put on hold so as to be three was allowed to go into effect I think for the twenty set for twenty Seventeen\nUm but not the fine so now this is for the for the rest of it as well\nRight so to get back to your original question Peter about the sequence of events\nThis week this legal challenge has been working its way through the courts since shortly after the law was passed in the summer of two thousand Seventeen and there was a trial underway with judge temple in in Nashua\nAnd in fact there was judge temple and just before the elections in two thousand Seventeen who said well we're gonna have to suspend the fines well this works its way through the courts\nAnd they would have been set up a to bring this to trial in early ah two thousand Eighteen if not for the fact that the state went out and hired attorney who has had some prior relationship or a judge temple and then he had to recuse himself\nOr earlier this year and so basically they had to start all over again and are really put themselves in a time crunch so it it when the ...\nOn Monday the state uh later appealed\nAnd then yesterday or the judge a frown heard their appeal and uh they worked out some conditions that would clarify exactly how they should proceed using the older documents the state is still a dissatisfied with that they've appealed\nTo the Supreme Court of the state to essentially put a stay on the judge rounds decision and let them move forward with the new verification forms and we'll probably hear the Supreme Court ruling on that later today\nJeff you want it to counter say when I mean I I you know you when you listen to days details on this it at the irony is like if it's possible and palpable it is [laughter]\nBecause ah this is supposed to simplify things and make things easier in this process and it's become just a crazy situation now where we're down to the last two a wire on on a lecture in a very important election is everybody's been saying for a long time now and what have the situation while waiting for the Supreme Court to rule perhaps this afternoon we don't know\nIt's it's just it's really a ... it's very instructive him on health why they call like sausage making\nDuring the current compromise that they weren't out as something like you used a new form under us be three up until election day on Sunday they go back to the twenty sixteen form and then on top of that the secretary of state's office are they ... said well we're not going to do anything right now until we see what the Supreme Court says or does everything is basically up in the air\nI rest my case ... yeah um so I Want to bring in a a interesting voice on this particular issue because ah Durham checklist supervisor ... a said making any last minute changes to the registration process will be a challenge but\nHas to be three she says would have caused even more headaches on election day and she she by the way had testified against the law in court and\nIt's going to be some work because we have to change and change we're going to be about\nSo common thing of course earlier in the week on this but it seems like the perspective on the ground at least from some people is that this is a good thing has to be three would have been a little burdensome Jeff yeah\nI think that's that's the opponents have seized on this really is this case it's kind of say well look this is this this is this a bill apparently had already had flaws in the fine was actually stayed and and now we're talking about this these other problems that that judge brown a scene in this\nUh it it it does kind of make you wonder was the state putting the cart before the horse by after seeing these rulings and has they've said earlier about you know the delay in it and are getting the lawyer and and getting their debt case set up\nWas was it really necessary to have this law take effect for this election and why learn things cleaned up first before they they decided to go with with what this law said I mean I I it I'm just saying this as as an observer of this\nYeah and it's interesting too that you know this this particular um ah the evolution of the story this week had to do not with small technical things but with the heart of the issue right\nAnd H.

in New Hampshire Business Review and dean spill yo to civic scholar in the school of arts and sciences at us and age you give us a call if you have questions or comments about the week's news the numbers one eight hundred\nEight nine to six four seven seven\nOr the major party gubernatorial candidates Mitt for a few debates recently were going to talk about their campaigns their stance on the issues\nPlease do way and if you haven't thought about this one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven or comment on our Facebook page where you can watch a live video of this radio broadcast that an H PR exchange so ah the the Kennedys met they spoke about a variety of issues ... paid family medical leave keeps coming up\nUh and on the the debate between Molly Kelly in ... new on Wednesday night on an HP are\nUh they had an exchange or about paid family medical leave\nObviously the governor when that was that\nA bean that it and it was a path to the house three times three times in the house\nUm he had a majority of his own party in the house in the Senate if he wanted to put through a ... family medical leave act that was the time to do it he didn't do it he had an opportunity to do it and later called it a vacation time as governor will ensure that we do pass\nRecreated ... leaves only want to give you thirty seconds to respond to work with a chemical and then I went I really don't want to vacation or it's not a vacation would be great because it's obviously not a vacation that comment came as part of a bigger conversation of course is not a vacation that's that's silly\nI'm at the end of the day when their plan we realized it was a trap of an income tax we try to ... we tried to support that that didn't get past I don't control the whole house\nSo I'm ... the trap income tax according to the governor Jeff you you you want to respond to the yeah I I I find it interesting that this has become a big issue in and actually it's it's apparently Molly Kelly's main issue is me she's been going all over about this thing uh it was it ... the bill\nThe term last session was basically a bill that ended up being having what they call an opt in ... you can you as an employee you could say I want to I Want to be part of this pet family medical leave program and they would take some something out of your paycheck dislike unemployment insurance that have some kind of ... funds for that\nAnd apparently what happened is that uh the the ... the department of regular ... rent some numbers and they said well you know if it's opt in it's probably not going to be as financially viable\nAs it should be that would they raise questions about it and after being passed as as Senator Kelly said in the house three times it goes to the Senate and it seemed like it might be getting through the supporters when we're very optimistic about it but the governor\nWho had been pretty quiet throughout the sessions said he was against it and that's what what happened was that the uh the bill just you know ... did not make it and uh the the real the real concern though the real problem was that with with this up in provision it's almost like\nIt wasn't enough and now the governor apparently is saying that he supports some kind of voluntary proposal which I haven't seen any details I've really does that it's kind of this idea of it he he does support it but it's not clear what he does support you know what kind of family medical leave program he does support because he said he does\nHe doesn't support a voluntary one but that's pretty much what the ... there was an ... and I really look at where there's a difference between voluntary enough to well no it's it's an opt in is voluntary as a you have to opt into this program to be part of it\nOr they way was initially designed and this was the heart of the governors concern is that you are automatically going to be in it and automatically have\nI don't know five to nine dollars a week to die from your paycheck automatically unless you opt out and the provision for opting out required you to have fill out a form that would be notarized\nSo the governor criticized that as an income tax because it would come out of your check so it's it's tax on your income\nOr if you did knocked out and they opt out provisions were too onerous and his view and uh using the bully pulpit to make that point these are\nThe bill was voted down even though it appeared on the glide path to passage with the governor has made clear that he supports\nA is a version that was actually proposed in committee\nOr by Republican representative and Lynn over which would essentially be or go to the private market for short term disability insurance with help from the state uh meaning get local ensure find insurance companies that went off or short term disability or the state will help facilitate the payment of the premium and let the private insurers handle it\nOr what you're going to have then is a very expensive premiums because you know in programs like that people only buy them when they think they're going to use them and when the only people who buy insurance for the people who are going to use it guess what it's extremely expensive\nSo or if this is the debate a that is under way on this insurance program and in a way it's a microcosm of the debate we're having an all insurers programs whether it's health insurance short term disability or family medical leave [noise]\nDo you want a mandatory program where everyone's in the pool even many people who may never use the program and therefore the costs are low for those who need it or do you want to have a program that's entirely optional where only people who needed are going to buy it and it's going to be very expensive\nI think the other out the other aspect of this would using a private insurance is is the is the fact that these people are leaving their jobs temporarily and what happened to the employer what's the employers often what ... what is the employee here she's supposed to do when its employees out for a week two weeks a month whatever of the leaders necessary\nWhat happens is that what happens if a physician especially if you're a small business this is what's been it has been a concern for a long time how would this actually we're\nDoing or just to take a step back you know what you heard in that particular clip it's part of a larger\nMolly Kelly as a as a tax and spend or using words like income tax Molly Kelly has taken the pledge not to or not to have a sales or income tax\nIncrease but doesn't it into his argued if you look at her record in the Senate that she's actually a a a a a tax and spend or that's going to be his arguments up you know more broadly speaking sooner you know it was in reasonably good shape use up by about ten points and each of the to the ... and the UNH poles\nOr it may be a little closer than that in the end um but it's got high approval or so this is going to this is a challenge for for Mali kills you need some help from a blue wave I think on this one\nYeah let's let's hear a little bit of the exchange that I'm a SUNY new and Kelly had about about taxes sooner did criticize Kelly for raising taxes many times during her time in the Senate after she said that she would not support a sales or income tax and then she voted to cut taxes for small businesses\nHer own words said very clearly to the teams that no when it comes to a sales and income tax I think everything should be on the table those are her words not mine so I Know it sounds convenient that now that she's running for governor oh well she's going to take the pledge and not raise those taxes but let's be fair I'm sure she didn't tell her constituents she was going to raise them fifty to sixty times when she ran for Senate but she did that\nI mean at the end of the day you have to be responsible I cut business taxes I limited the electricity consumption tacked this is how you drive business and create opportunity for individual because suicide or do you want to respond\nTo that or you know let let me be clear once again that I Do not support and would veto it fails income tax and in a response to my opponents at um at language here about taxes you know\nEvery every time we are in a discussion I'm at and it comes it has happened to me with my opponent and certainly with the Republican Party that ah when we're not quite sure how to answer certain questions that we don't want to know how to move forward or support policy we bring up um you know the political\nFear tactic which is taxes and it continues to be brought up all the\nTime in fact I feel that fear tactics I'd be honest I\nI Believe that our voters are tired of hearing that and I believe that our voters are much smarter smarter than to continue to hear that same rhetoric which is really a complete political fear tactic\nSo um but ... says bringing up this issue this this tax issue is is a fear tactic those who seems to be saying look if she\nPosition a little bit perfect encapsulated in what I was talking about that's the Republican strategy is to try ... class of ... greatest hits absolutely so it shouldn't be surprised about Adam ... absolutely not get us fill in the blanks without the opponent's name and it's the same rate as we should\nBe prepared for them to mine her record as a state legislator to to to be able to deal with whatever they might throw out or in that respect\nIt's interesting we we did we did a U.S up of a questionnaire with the two two major party candidates for governor and and we asked a question about business taxes and apparently a center Kelly who all at one point it said she would would uh get rid of the the ... the ... in the business ... and the business enterprise tax\nChanged her mind and I and our questionnaire and said that she would keep the business enterprises tax tax cuts but still would try to roll back the cuts in the business profits tax and that was you know that was an interesting change in her position that apparently was reflect a little bit slightly in this debate\nBut it it's it's it's apparent that ... the idea of taxes is moving issue for her she's not she's still not clear on on her positions on it and this is what\nBoy it's a that's a tough question you know the reality is that the\nCertainly comprehensive immigration reform but immigration\nReform a general has become such a politically polarizing a issue that ah it's just very difficult to see any compromise a ... on any of this and as soon as you just get these kind of repeated attempts in Congress by a different different uh you know different parts of the of the either the house or the Senate to come up with a bill and are\nJust getting everybody to agree and to not use it as kind of a political weapon during the election season which is a good chunk of the time these days because now we're going to get into the next presidential cycle as soon as this\nGoes over seven yeah it's just it's it's just become almost an impossibility and it's really driven by the by the kind of partisan makeup of Congress you need one party with a significant majorities in order to really get anything done\nIn while we had a a compromise that\nCuster alluded to him which was supported by a no less than the Republican presidential candidate\nA at the time and Senator McCain and Lindsey Graham and other prominent Republicans and the votes appear to be there a but a massive\nContact your congressman campaign orchestrated by the anti immigration voices on TALK radio and the like mobilized their base and that was shot down and that was the last time there was any people to Congress about immigration\nJeff I'm also not as ... not convinced that immigration is at the top of the agenda for typical New Hampshire voters I think there's other concerns that that are ... out far outweigh or this because it's not an issue that\nWe necessarily live with daily we'd do as David said you know it does affect us economically very much so but I don't think I think things more like obviously the opioid crisis of cost of health care or access to health care or other issues I think\nTo me seemed to be way more on on people's minds than than immigration which seems to be one of these giant a national uh you know what issues that may be against Pete gets people riled up\nHear from Steve Negron on this issue or a he was asked what he thinks need to be done with immigration and he said quote Arbor over arching changes are needed\nI Believe right now we need to look at you know how do we make sure that the people coming into the border in our country whether it's through um the southern border even the northern border seaports airport you know that that we're a land of laws um there's a right way to do it we're not doing it right now we need to get back to it\nSo a dean let me ask you are your thoughts on the CD to race at the moment sure\nIn general you know I just see too as I as I've said is getting a getting a lot less attention in the news in any other races which is usually a good sign for the incumbent when the races and getting a lot of coverage you know Custer and in most polling is up double digits or\nShe's enjoying some of the highest favorability of her career which at one point had been a little bit of an issue for her she got a big campaign war chest to she raised over four million dollars\nA you know Steve Negron has had some issues with kind of voter recognition and visibility\nUh my other ... I think the other concern for him is that that second CD is increasingly become more centrist even leaning slightly democratic conquered Hanover Lebanon down to keen increasingly democratic\nUh and he is not really adjusted his agenda uh to kind of meet the demographics of the district is very very conservative on climate change abortion rights\nGay conversion therapy a number of social issues that I just think uh make it a little challenging for him to to kind of a meet up with the demographics of that district so I think for that race she's in reasonably good shape\nAll right well this is the weekly New Hampshire news roundup I'm Peter below still to come up Michael ... who in Castro to possible president democratic presidential candidates and the twenty twenty five to unseat president Donald Trump there in New Hampshire this week but do you think of them as candidates give us a call the number is one eight hundred eight nine to\nSix four seven seven email exchange at an H.

Manchester has cheaper cost of living David says simple math cause and effect day what do you think of his comments\nWell a fancy restaurant has to pay wages sufficient to support a a an apartment and lifestyle in Portsmouth proper I don't think there's any restaurant that could do so except for the highest end restaurants with waiters that make tips in the hundreds of dollars a night\nOr it's the assumption not on the ... a part of a a lot of Portsmouth employers that their employees won't be living in Portsmouth that there'll be commuting there from happening in Rochester and more affordable places are but there's no question about it a sports with is extremely expensive place to live\nAnd opening a business there is a an extremely expensive proposition\nAnd that's ... it's an ongoing or a discussion I guess it's a mild way of putting it in and especially on the seat and I see costs but secondly in Portsmouth and the cost of housing and the inability to have a workforce that actually lives in the city 'cause it's it's almost impossible unless you have a you know really good job to be living there\nNow we got another comment from Tom in Portsmouth who said part of the reason for the state's labor shortage put that in quotes or the low end stagnant wages paid by New Hampshire employers are Tom cites a number I don't I don't know where he got this number but he says more than ... eighty thousand New Hampshire workers commute to Massachusetts to work because of higher wages paid\nIn Massachusetts a Thanks Tom for your comment really appreciate that um want to get a few more news items in before the end of the hour or talk about that Michael ... who is the lawyer for\nUm a porn star Stormy Daniels in suits against the president he was in New Hampshire again this week once again addressing questions about as possible candidacy for president and twenty twenty and here's what I wanted to ask the gentleman about uh he was quoted in sea coast online dot com and saying quote\nWhat I Would ask in twenty twenty when it comes time to pick a nominee on the Democratic side for the presidency that you pick a person who has the best shot of beating Donald Trump\nNot the person in your heart that you would think would make the best president theme what do you make of his campaign message\nThat's well that's specific to a statement about picking the person who is most likely be Donald Trump I mean that's kind of standard strategic voting there is a long history and political science that says that\nThe that the partisans often pick the person they think is most likely to win who's most viable rather than the person in their heart who's their their true preference so so I don't know that that's not a particularly controversial thing to say but with the more interesting issue with with Avon ideas that he has made the comments are suggesting that whoever the or\nWhoever the Democratic nominee is it's going to have to be prepared to to basically punch counter punch with Trump or get us down and dirty as the president might on the campaign trail\nUh you know we had the ... the now famous comment by former\nAttorney general Eric Holder who said you know instead of\nThe Democrats had been saying when they go low we go high he's I Know when they go low we have to kick them and that caused a bit of consternation within the party so\nSo ... kind of one end of what the debate is going to be among Democrats about how to deal with Trump do you have to be really aggressive and hit him back when you take the high road or some kind of mix in between and ... has been very vocal about you have to pick somebody who can just\nHit Trump back as hard as he hits even though Trump says he's a famous counter punch are so somebody else who can counter punch in return but but as I said you know it's there's a long history of research showing that voters they made like one candidate but they often in the in vogue strategically for the member of their party they think is most likely to be able to go toe to toe with income but but if you buy the\nThey said you don't have ... ness I pick the person would be the best president\nThat's a kind of a really a", "show_name": "Weekly NH News Roundup", "year": "2018", "city": "Keene", "day": "26"}
