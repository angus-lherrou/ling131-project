I and a an HP has ... only having speaking with the gubernatorial candidates all week on MORNING edition and all things considered we spoke with Molly Kelly and a ... in Mali Kelly said she would support\nThe paid family leave build that recently failed in the state legislature uh and she she commented on that with an H ... n MORNING EDITION\nI Would support that piece of legislation Christian ... said paid family medical leave is a vacation it's not a vacation\nI've asked the governor could he support any version of paid family medical leave bill and he said who happen to be voluntary that would be in a central component of and do you see that as being a a worthwhile compromise you know\n'cause I knew had an opportunity to pass it paid family medical leave in some form that he wanted to do and he didn't so you know I Will I as governor and make paid family medical leave a reality\nIn governance in and he did say that he said that you know sure paid family leave but businesses have to be able to voluntarily do it not be forced by the state to do it um is this going to be an issue that resonates with voters clearly Molly Kelly wants to make an issue of it what do you think\nTrends you know that's a good question just how many people care about it I'm ...\nKelly has really made a central part of of her campaign but I just wonder how many people are going to turn out because of paid family leave\nAt even when the uh the the house and Senate were debating it here in New Hampshire during the last legislative session you know I I think there were certainly people who are very interested in it but I just wonder what you know in terms of the total population\nIs it more than one percent ten percent of people who care uh and and I don't know I mean that's something that will certainly be taking a look\nAt it I think part of the problem is and I and I've heard this from a couple of different voters\nIt's it's a very difficult issue too easily encapsulate for people as a motivation for getting him to turn out it's a little bit complicated to explain what the debate was in the last session over the funding mechanism and\nYou know is it a tax is it an insurance program you know really what is it an hour to work and who would pay for it and also you know it can be present that is something where if you don't want it or you're going to have to pay for it to support for someone else or they're all these different ways you can cut into it\nAnd I just think that uh it it's a little bit of a difficult issue in that respect\nUh to to to talking about concisely that being said Molly Kelly's been running in pretty heavy rotation an advertisement that\nHas a number of different people talking about how critical\nOr that or is or would have been to their particular family issue whatever the medical issue might be so so that's a pretty it's a pretty powerful commercial but nonetheless this is just\nKind of a difficult issue to really hope to your campaign on\nAnd there were some people who were opposed to the funding mechanism that was being discussed in Concord so don't forget will what they were talking about was\nThey were going to take money out of every paycheck to pay for what they would call insurance pool a but opponents called it a tax called an income tax and that's why the governor was against it\nSo that was something that I think people were were afraid of New Hampshire and they weren't they weren't entirely clear about the funding mechanism they would see their paychecks decreased because of the way that this was being discussed\nAnd so I think that they're what I think that I think that if you look at the ... if you look at the polling data people are in support of paid family leave overall the question is just how you find it how you do it in\nA governor Sununu has been a on the campaign trail talking about his success or with the state's economy are getting businesses to expand here getting businesses to come here that is one of the things that I spoke with him about on all things considered this week I asked him about his efforts to visit one hundred businesses from out of state and bring them here and here's what he said\nI sat with a woman from a small company in Arizona I sat with a gentleman with a small company uh just outside of Montreal um he's in Berlin now she's over in Portsmouth um we've had a large companies come in we we talked to businesses in Massachusetts all the time that are are trying to again ... more ... opportunity and flexibility for themselves and their workers they're coming up here\nWe have had businesses that have we're thinking one time of leaving a expanding elsewhere like kitchen or or be there now here and their best to millions of dollars in in a right here in New Hampshire Alonzo a great example international company I decided with the Trump tax cuts they were going to make a very large investment and one of their facilities around the world they chose fortunate\nSo in this conversation a definition any sort of pivoted from companies that he visited\nA and try to lure into the state to companies that were already here that expand that which is you know for one could argue is a good thing not necessarily the same thing uh but but dean ... how would you evaluate governors any news record when it comes to that campaign promise he made two years ago yeah companies to come here\nRight and I think it was a you know it worked well as the ... campaign promise and kind of a way to kick off his governorship by I think there was some question about you know in the end what would the data look like and uh\nUh you know he has the ... I think it would be more problematic if we were in some sort of recession here in the state uh you know the economy's doing really well here and nationally so uh when you're the chief executive and the state or the chief executive of the country when the economy's doing while you typically get credit for it or even if maybe the record kind of below the surface is a little bit more on clear but\nSo she's at a good point in her career she has more money uh she's been more season now as a legislator and I think those are just challenges that that that the Steve underground has to has to deal with in terms of being more visible and figuring out you know how to fit with the the dynamics of the second CD\nOne of the things that struck me in that poll with that Seventy five percent of voters said they didn't know who Steve net Ron ... is and that's ... that's got to be a shocking numbers so you're you set three quarters of the electric don't know who you are and you're up against a candidate who has four million dollars I I mean that's those are some difficult numbers\nSo we've got a question from Michael uh he wrote in to\nAsk which major party suffers more from a libertarian being on the ballot Republican or Democrat and seems like this is what Michael is saying seems like Democrats could lose votes from people who vote on social issues and Republicans could lose voters concerned with fiscal issues what do you think ...\nI think neither party suffers I I think probably if yeah if you look at the if you look at the polling data doesn't seem like the libertarians are or stealing many votes I shouldn't say stealing the but they're they're not taking away many votes from either party um and so I I you know I Wonder if\nPeople in this election just don't want to I think there are some times where one party will be doing so well that people say you know I'm going to do a protest vote I'm going to go libertarian I just don't see that happening in this cycle\nWhat do you think yeah sorry excuse me it's hard to know at this point\nYou know I think that's certainly a reason the the the emails certainly lays out a reasonable reasonable hypothesis or the we have had congressional races in other races over the years where\nYou know the libertarians is a maybe a well known in that particular district or has a long history of kind of being involved in electoral politics and get a few percentage points and the and that makes a difference but yeah\nThe debate next week a and I I I don't think the libertarian is included in that debate don't hear it on HBO so that sort of symptomatic of why it's so difficult for these parties to get any traction mhm\nThis is the weekly New Hampshire news round up on the exchange on HBO or speaking with dean spill yo to\nCivic scholar in the school of arts and sciences at us in each you and the author of the website and each political capital and trends winner of the union leader coming up lawyers list this is a list of police officers with so called credibility issues media organizations in the ACLU of New Hampshire have gone to court to get the list released state says\nNo way what do you think should the public's see this list give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven or email exchange at an H.

I think that if if he wins Manchester you know he's from Manchester people know him\nUm and and if he gets big numbers here that's going to be a difficult race friday Edwards\n... or some other comments made during that debate um or the foreign rather the A. R. P. form a Democrat Chris Pappas says he was for paid family leave intended to paid time off policy for employees had his own family restaurant spirited\nYou don't want people choosing between being with their family had a tough time and losing out on work and I think as a country and we should treat everyone that way\nSo that was ... stance on uh the the paid family leave again seems to be a big issue for Democrats this time around a Eddie Edwards responded a that paid time off it should be at the discretion of individual businesses like ... business ... they made a decision that should not be a according to Edwards the government's choice\nIs absolutely right he made that to us as a business person another because it may not want to make that choice they may not have the same dedication loyalty from their employees that he may scar by doing that that the free market solution not a governmental\nSo you've got one candidate Chris Pappas pushing for a government solution and the Republican pushing for free market solution not entirely surprising trying\nNot entirely surprising this has been a theme of a number of races that we've been watching the cycle almost all races\nAre and so you know I think I again and they said this earlier but I just wonder how many people are going to turn out based on paid family leave\nThat something that that you know I think I think as dean said earlier it's it can be a complicated issue for people to understand I think if you look at the numbers people are supportive of it but they just don't ... I I don't think that there's a clear vision among the electorate at least on how it should work mhm\nYeah and you know just to take a step back a moment you talking about the the larger context which I Believe is very important in in particularly in U.S House races\nOr you know this is uh the first midterm election after a new a new president and President Trump's approval has picked up a little bit uh recently I think is up to about forty one or forty two percent which is still low by\nBy historic a stark standards are and you know these first midterms are typically a time when you get a little bit of a backlash from the party out of power we've only had two or three\nTimes in our modern history where the party of the president in ...\nA at a midterm election the most recent was two thousand and two and George W. Bush ... sort of a rally around the president effect in the wake of nine eleven and he picked up some seats but it's a very rare you typically have an expectation that ah that ... that the party out of power in this case Democrats\nShould pick up seats whether it be enough to take back the house we don't know but in that kind of swing district\nOther states and the governor has said that um\nYou know the the state has more money than knows what to do what they said this recently I think it was a hundred and fifty million dollar surplus for at least this year was a ... do you remember yeah see I didn't like that so would this health if like let's say he is he wanted to use some of that for the pension fund would that would that work I think every little bit helps but it's\nIt's a bigger it's a bigger issue which is that they they back going back\nTwenty years they can they use numbers that were just too rosy they thought that the pension fund would grow by a certain amount and that just wasn't a realistic number for them to use and so uh over Twenty years\nVis vis a difference has has grown because they just could not meet those ah you know numbers don't forget there was a there was that you know the Internet crash\nAnd then then the great recession in two thousand eighty thousand nine and so there's been this headwind for the pension fund that they have not been able to overcome and they're just in terms of what people are trying to do now is just make sure that over the next twenty or Thirty years that doesn't continue to grow okay\nA listeners give us a call if you have questions or comments\nSupport for an H ... comes from you our listeners and from service credit union supporting businesses throughout New Hampshire from the generic development projects to fundamental thanking needs programs and services designed for businesses who are ready to grow more I grow with SCU\nDot com and it might\nBe there was in the it was in the story we'll talk about it\nGive us a call if you have questions or comments one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven email exchange it N.

P.

I was not\nUh and it was that we use that as our headline and that was our number one most red story of the entire week because that got so much national attention what he you know his hit the words that he was using\nA so I you know I think that if if that if the readership of the story or had any any bearing on how people are feeling and turn out I think that's probably a good sign for Democrats um so but we'll see\nOK few more things to discuss before we wrap up the show here today chief days the Manchester Police department has ordered has been ordered to develop a better policy on granting police pay days off\n... ordered an internal audit into these so called chief days those are paid days off for police that they don't count towards vacation time what was the issue with the chief days ... so this was an\nIssue that had not been public before before before the union leader reported on it or the Manchester Police department was giving 'em at the discretion of the police chief what was called a chief day so if you're a police officer who went above and beyond or you volunteered at the foot race for the falling or you were the officer of the month\nThey're all kinds of reasons to get a chief day which was basically you could you could cashing your chief day for for a day off\nUm and so the practice was had been approved back in the nineties under under a previous police chief\nBut it was it was very small and they have to be approved by the police commission that group there were more than a hundred chief Dave chief days given out last year\nAnd Ottoman were surprised I think when they read our story to see the number of chief days and and to understand that there wasn't actually a formal policy in place for how these chief days were were being used or how they were being being given out a so there was an eternal audit that ... that the city went through or they found that the practice had been expanded\nUm there was no cost that they said he couldn't couldn't determine how much this cost taxpayers\nA and police have said that it's actually a beneficial thing to be able to give out of a ... a chief day if somebody does do a very good job or something but Alterman were concerned that you know if you're if you're a police officer and you're volunteering at at a at a ... foot race um that you shouldn't get a day off because of that\nSo they're the ultimate have asked the police to come up with a formal policy and bring it back to the board so they can vote on it everyone has the understanding of what exactly is in place and there's something in writing to determine how you get a chief day\nYeah 'cause the current police chief said that he liked to maintain the ability to do this is just a matter of having proper oversight for it\nAnd the and the cost is an issue any bad done it by something like a four hundred and sixty or four hundred and sixty five\nChief days in total that over here in Ninety thousand yeah yeah but what since two thousand I think that's what it was the original policy you can correct me wrong if I'm wrong ... was it the mayor Craig's father who was a father in law there in la rather right that's right father in law who was the original\nA creator of this is interesting little political tidbit there\nOh okay well survivor law bringing bringing it back around okay so what's so what's the next up we're just waiting for the city council to to vote on whatever policy where the yeah the\nYeah the police are going to bring back policy and and police chief ... says look it's beneficial for state when somebody used when a police officer uses a chief day they can't bring in somebody else on overtime\nSo they actually say that this is a beneficial thing to help them with with staffing um and so they want to be able to use it they want to be able to continue if everyone just says we need to see something in black and white to understand\nHow these are being used we didn't need to understand how many are are are happening what's interesting about this is that a before this um you know be before the union leaders are coverage of this\nUm alderman the mayor nobody said that everyone said that they didn't even know this was happening\nIs anybody saying like cheap days in general are bad thing because I mean it seems like there's an argument to be made\nAnd and no one has outright said this is a bad thing people what people are saying is that the way it's being done is not right and that that if we at the city for the city wants to do it it needs to be done in a legal way it needs to be done in a in a way where there's a policy and that it has been voted on\nOkay or listeners give us a call if you have questions or comments about the week's news one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven or send an email exchange at an H.

businesses have to be able to voluntarily do it not be forced by the state to do it um is this going to be an issue that resonates with voters clearly Molly Kelly wants to make an issue of it what do you think\nTrends you know that's a good question just how many people care about it um and it's something that you yes you're right Molly Kelly has really made a central part of of her campaign but I just wonder how many people are going to turn out because of paid family leave\nAnd even when the uh the the house and Senate were debating it here in New Hampshire during the last legislative session you know I I think there were certainly people who are very interested in it but I just wonder what you know in terms of the total population\nIs it more than one percent ten percent of people who care uh and and I don't know I mean that's something that will certainly be taking a look\nIt I think part of the problem is and I and I've heard this from a couple of different voters it's it's a very difficult issue too easily encapsulate for people as a motivation for getting him to turn out it's a little bit complicated to explain what the debate was in the last session over the funding mechanism and you know is it a tax is it an insurance program you know really what is it an hour to work and\nWho would pay for it and also you know it can be present that is something where if you don't want it or you're going to have to pay for it to support for someone else or they're all these different ways you can cut into it and I just think that uh it it's a little bit of a difficult issue in that respect\nUh to to to talk about concisely that being said Molly Kelly's been running in pretty heavy rotation an advertisement that has a number of different people talking about how critical or that or is or what have been to their particular uh family issue whatever the medical issue might be\nSupport for any ... life's dream comes from you our listeners and from Congress

independent in your home and live life to the fullest\nDid it the RV an A. dot org\nWere were afraid of in New Hampshire and they weren't they weren't entirely clear about the funding mechanism they would see their paychecks decreased because of the way that this was being discussed\nAnd so I think that they're what I think that I think that if you look at the ... if you look at the polling data people are in support of paid family leave overall the question is just how you find it how you do it\nIn a governor Sununu has been a on the campaign trail talking about his success or with the state's economy are getting businesses to expand here getting businesses to come here that's one of the things that I spoke with him about on all things considered this week I asked him about his efforts to visit one hundred businesses from out of state and bring them here and here's what he said\nI start with a woman from a small company in Arizona I sat with a gentleman with a small company ah just outside of Montreal um he's in Berlin now she's over in Portsmouth um we've had a large companies come in we we talked to businesses in Massachusetts all the time that are are trying to ... again ... more ... opportunity and flexibility for themselves and their workers they're coming up here\nWe have had businesses that have we're thinking one time of leaving a expanding elsewhere like Kitchener or be there now here and they're investing millions of dollars in in a right here in New Hampshire Alonzo a great example international company I decided with the Trump tax cuts they were going to make a very large investment and one of their facilities around the world they chose fortunate\nSo in this conversation a governor she knew sort of pivoted from companies that he visited\nA and try to lure into the state to companies that were already here that expand that which is you know for one could argue is a good thing not necessarily the same thing uh but but dean ... how would you evaluate governors and in his record when it comes to that campaign promise he made two years ago yeah companies to come here\nRight and I think it was a you know it worked well as a ... a campaign promise and kind of a way to kick off his governorship I think there was some question about you know in the end what would the data look like and uh\nUh you know he has the ... I think it would be more problematic if we were in some sort of recession here in the state uh you know the economy's doing really well here in nationally so ah when you're the chief executive in the state or the chief executive of the country\nWhen the economy's doing while you typically get credit for it or even if maybe the record kind of below the surface was a little bit more on clear but uh but but certainly it's this is a much easier issue for him to finesse given the current economic system scenario than it would be if we were in in in a tough shape and the state\n... ... people are gonna be upset with me for saying this but the way that the governorship was set up in New Hampshire at a lot of it is you're kind of the biggest cheerleader for the state\nAnd that's what he's been doing um you don't have a story I mean you can't wave a wand and get a business to move here you can't wave a wand and give them a tax break I mean there's so many steps to go through but you can't give us some businesses tax breaks and get them to come sure but you can't just the governor of the way it's set up\nSo we've got a question from Michael uh he wrote in to\nAsk which major party suffers more from a libertarian being on the ballot Republican or Democrat seems like this is what Michael is saying seems like Democrats could lose votes from people who vote on social issues and Republicans could lose voters concerned with fiscal issues what do you think ...\nI think neither party suffers I I think probably if yeah if you look at the if you look at the polling data doesn't seem like the libertarians are or stealing many votes I shouldn't say stealing the but they're they're not taking away many votes from either party um and so I I you know I Wonder if\nPeople in this election just don't want to I think there are some times where one party will be doing so well that people say you know I'm going to do a protest vote I'm gonna go libertarian I just don't see that happening in this cycle\nDean what do you think yes our excuse me it's hard to know at this point\nYou know I think that's certainly a result of the emails certainly lays out a reasonable reasonable hypothesis or the we have had congressional races in other races over the years where\nYou know the libertarians is a maybe a well known in that particular district or has a long history of kind of being involved in electoral politics and get a few percentage points and uh\nAnd that makes a difference but yeah there's you know as you mentioned you know there's the ... the debate next week and I I I don't think the libertarian is included in that debate here at an age so that sort of symptomatic of why it's so difficult for these parties to get any traction and\nThis is the weekly New Hampshire news round up on the exchange on HBO or speaking with dean spill yo to civic scholar in the school of arts and sciences at us in each you and the author of the Web site in each political capital\nAnd trends winner of the union leader coming up\nLaurie is less this is a list of police officers with so called credibility issues media organizations and the ACLU New Hampshire have gone to court to get the list released state says\nNo way what do you think should the public see this list give us a call one eight hundred eight nine to six or seven seven or email exchange at an H.

I think that if if he wins Manchester you know he's from Manchester people know him um and and if he gets big numbers here that's going to be a difficult race friday Edwards mhm\nOr some other comments made during that debate um or the form rather the A. R. P. form a Democrat Chris ... says he was for paid family leave and how did the paid time off policy for employees at his own family restaurant period and\nYou don't want people choosing between being with their family had a tough time and losing out on work and I think as a country and we should treat everyone that way\nSo that was ... stance on uh the the paid family leave again seems to be a big issue for Democrats this time around a\nEddie Edwards responded or that paid time off it should be at the discretion of individual businesses like ... business ... they made a decision that should not be a according to Edwards or the government's choice\nQuizzes absolutely right he made that towards other business for another visit may not want to me that's what they may not have the same dedication loyalty from their employees he may gar by doing that the free market solution not a government\nSo you've got one candidate Chris Pappas pushing for a government solution and the Republican pushing for a free market solution not entirely surprising trying\nNot entirely surprising this has been a theme of a number of races that we've been watching the ... the cycle almost all races are and so you know I think I again and I said this earlier but I just wonder how many people are going to turn out based on paid family leave\nThat it's something that that you know I think I think as dean said earlier it's it can be a complicated issue for people understand I think if you look at the number of people are supportive of it but they just don't ... I I don't think that there's a clear vision among the electorate at least on how it should work mhm\nYeah and you know just to take a step back a moment ... ... talking about the the larger context which I Believe is very important in in particularly in U.S House races\nOr you know this is uh the first midterm election after a new a new president and President Trump's ... you know approval has picked up a little bit\nUh recently I think is up to about forty one or forty two percent which is still low by by historic uh start standards are and you know these first midterms are typically a time when you get a little bit of a backlash from the party out of power we've only had two or three\nTimes in our modern history where the\nParty of the president in power has picked up seats a at a midterm election the most recent was two thousand and two and George W. Bush had are sort of a rally around the president effect in the wake of nine eleven and he picked up some seats but it's very rare you typically ever an expectation ah that ah that ... that the party out of power in this case Democrats\nYou should pick up seats whether it be enough to take back the house we don't know but in that kind of swing district\nA turnout is going to be very important and even though Trump won that district by a couple of points\nAre in the general against Hillary Clinton can text Julie speaking this is just a better year to be a democratic candidate running for a U.S house seat in New Hampshire other certainly other things that can intervene uh but you look at kind of the patterns over in recent history and expectation is Democrats should do well\nListeners give us a call if you have questions or comments about the week's news one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven but let's leave the politics aside for a moment to talk about lawyers list because a group\nTwenty years they can they use numbers that were just too rosy they thought that the pension fund would grow by a certain amount and that just wasn't a realistic number for them to use and so uh over Twenty years\nVis vis a difference has has grown because they just could not\nMeet those ah you know numbers don't forget there was a there was that you know the Internet crash and then then the great recession in two thousand eighty thousand nine and so there's been this headwind for the pension fund that they have not been able to overcome and they're just as to what people are trying to do now is just make sure that over the next twenty or Thirty years that doesn't continue to grow\nOkay a listeners give us a call if you have questions or comments about the week's news this is the weekly New Hampshire news round up on an H.

I was not the advocate in any kind of violence or anything\nAnd it was that we use that as our headline and that was our number one most red story of the entire week because that got so much national attention what he you know his hit the words that he was using a so I you know I think that if if that if the readership of the story\nOr had any any bearing on how people are feeling and turn out I think that's probably a good sign for Democrats um so but we'll see\nOK few more things to discuss before we wrap up the show here today chief days the Manchester Police department has ordered has been ordered to develop a better policy on granting police pay days off mare Joyce Craig ordered an internal audit into these so called chief days\nThose are paid days off for police that they don't count towards vacation time what was the issue with the chief days trying so\nThis was an issue that had not been public before before before the union leader reported on it at the Manchester Police department was giving\n'em at the discretion of the police chief what was called a chief gay so if you're a police officer who went above and beyond or you volunteered at the foot writes for the falling or you were the officer of the month they're all kinds of reasons to get a chief day which was basically you could you could cashing your chief day for for a day off\nUm and so the practice was had been\nI'm a previous police chief but it was it was very small and they have to be approved by the police commission that grew there were more than a hundred chief Dave chief days given out last year\nAnd Alterman were surprised I think when they read our story to see the number of chief days and and to\nUnderstand that there wasn't actually a formal policy in place for how these chief days were were being used or how they were being being given out a so there was an eternal audit though that the city went through a they found that the practice had been expanded\nUm there was no cost that they said he couldn't couldn't determine how much this cost taxpayers\nAre and police have said that it's actually a beneficial thing to be able to give out a ... a chief day if somebody does do a very good job or something but Alterman were concerned that you know if you were ... if you're a police officer and you're volunteering at at a at a ... foot race um that you shouldn't get a day off or because of that\nSo they're the ultimate had asked police to come up with a formal policy and bring it back to the board so they can vote on it so everyone has an understanding of what exactly is in place and there's something in writing to determine how you get a chief day\nYeah 'cause the the current police chief said that you'd like to maintain the ability to do this is just a matter of having proper oversight for it\nAnd the and the cost is an issue I think they had done it by something like a four hundred and sixty four hundred and sixty five\nChief days in total that over here in Ninety thousand yeah yeah but we're since two thousand I think that's what it was the original policy you can correct me wrong if I'm wrong trend was it the mayor ... father who was a father in law father in law rather right that's right father in law who was the original\nA creator of this is sort of interesting little political tidbit there\nOh okay well survivor in la ... bringing back around okay so what's so what's the next up we're just waiting for the city council to to vote on whatever policy where\nThe yeah the yeah the police are going to bring back policy and and police chief Carlos ... says look it's beneficial for state when somebody used when a police officer uses the chief day they can't bring in somebody else on overtime\nSo they actually say that this is a beneficial thing to help them with with staffing um and so they want to be able to use it they want to be able to continue it but they just everyone just says we need to see something in black and white to understand how these are being used we didn't need to understand how many are are are happening what's interesting about this is that\nA before this um you know be before the union leaders are coverage of this\nUm alderman the mayor nobody said that everyone said that they didn't even know this was happening\nAs anybody saying like cheap days in general are bad thing 'cause I mean it seems like there's an argument made that this would be good for morale\nIt right and and no one has outright said this is a bad thing people what people are saying is that the way it's being done is not right and that that if we if the city for the city wants to do it it needs to be done in a legal way it needs to be done in a in a way where there's a policy and that it has been\nVoted on okay or listeners give us a call if you have questions or comments about the week's news one eight hundred eight nine to six four seven seven or send an email exchange at an H.
