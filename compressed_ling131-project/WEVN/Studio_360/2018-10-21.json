Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow hey everyone pay us money they either the narrative has changed so many times it's election cycle or are we just seeing a normal tightening\nIt was like early September just after the summer when everyone started tipping where people were starting to look at Arizona Tennessee Texas all my goodness everyone wants to talk about the Texas senator yeah this is the right to do right well you know solve that has fallen back to political gravity and political reality\nYou know a lot of people will get to the cabinet confirmation battle and the fact that Republican enthusiasm spiked\nBut a lot of this is just natural tightening and in states like Tennessee and Texas they're just happened to be more Republicans there\nWe started the cycle with Republicans very hopeful that they could pick up three four five seats because the Senate battleground is full of red states where Donald Trump is extremely popular\nAnd to me what's been the interesting thing about the cycle is that those dreams have gone away that yes there was that blip of democratic hopefulness and the fall that oh maybe they could pick up a couple and hold their own everywhere and maybe even the perennial pipe dream of Texas\nCame up again but now we're back to where we were and Republicans are doing worse I think in the Senate battleground than they should be given the map and given the great economy that they've got\nWe've entered that final few weeks of an election that's kind of the dark side of the moon where there's not many firms data points but suddenly you see wild shift in how a political observers view things the Democrats might be fine after all the Democrats might be totally screwed and I think it's just hard to tell especially in\nA midterm where it seems legitimate that enthusiasm is higher than before and we just don't know what that means in terms of who shows up to vote compared to typical midterm\nThis is a politics you from NPR I must of my ... and it feels like every week there is wide and major news story that dominates the headlines and because of that other important stories I can get overlooked\nWe dive into one story this week they did not get a lot of attention and to do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here I'm going to be with us around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week as white\nHouse counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise and why it matters that he left\nThe bare bones of these years already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House down again is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney pets baloney or who is well known in Republican legal circles but while simple Loni is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay and Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for a vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush\nAnd President Bill Clinton so he is a veteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe all of this and that this feels Harry inside already to me right in terms of who's who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in a pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks um is that a fair assessment\nIs a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be hurting when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton card in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election\nThat's a report that it's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court of appeals court levels over the country and a lot\nThe trumps highest accomplishment that take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier I mean there Robert Mueller and McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed he did and that was apparently can don't within the White House is part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation\nOr in a year if at all possible uh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending trumped nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of than twenty sixteen Trump campaign\nOr does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood she has been\nHandling much um the mole or met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nAnd do you want to ask you about the job itself did die again represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what does he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that's ambiguity which has really been with us for very long time and it created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity ... speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about this grand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution and the tradition of the office or to the humans who have held the office where it is one in the other begin drawing that lunch never been easy but it's never been more important\nWell thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up I tend to the headlines that we may have missed because of all the other news it's been happening things you write fiction [noise]\nThis is the politics show from the NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back\nIt's the politics show on HBO or it's eleven twenty five good morning support for an age PR comes from you our listeners and from ... freedom plan and northeast elder dental a partnership created for better or lean overall health right here in New Hampshire more teeth to toes dot com\nAnd from pushes strata more a new set of an Eighteen black came in with a two liter turbo charged engine and night blue metallic jet black or a silver metallic weights more Porsche strata ... dot com\nI'm Jeremy hops in the abduction of more than two hundred and Seventy Nigerian girls from a school by the terrorist group Boko Haram grabbed the world's attention and twenty fourteen an HBO documentary profiles some of the girls who made it out\nThat you ... who had taken lead actually just the tip of the ice that there are thousands\nOf dollars in Nigeria have taken by that have on that next time on here and now [noise]\nThere are no tomorrow at noon here on an age PR\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from twenty three and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio\nFrom the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities and the United states and globally for more than twenty five years learn more\nAnd from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation uh R.

H. Y. Y. Joe thanks for joining us great to be here do you mean you can start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basics of who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare and won support from House Republicans of course it didn't become law and\nWe'll talk a little bit more about that he's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on national security council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district so talk to us a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more urban MacArthur has but MacArthur is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it was a little bit more\nDetail about who lives in this district I mean it's uh\nRight when you look at it on the map it kinda goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out\nThat way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThe Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter this time I mean given to go talk to us a little bit about why\nDemocrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you saw MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort and this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of seat that goes\nIn general is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nHealthcare has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country that I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district\nIs it kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed the current health care structure you can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip from twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats\nDemocrats this time around her using it in their favor as the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half\nOf all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those were pro a CIA and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions\nA line that we might not have heard say four years ago it's amazing to see Republicans on their back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place that NPR ... thank you so much You're welcome and thank you Joe Hernandez from NPR member station WHYY you gotta\n[noise]\nThis is the politics you from
