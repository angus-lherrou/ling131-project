the other side of dirty politics\nWhat you want to do is destroyed this guy's alive hold this seat open and hope you win at twenty twenty\nNow just weeks before voters head to the polls Kavanaugh is

became clear protestors warm\nCouch [laughter]\nWhat a lasting impact of this on the court on the national mood on the mid term election to talk about all of that we've got congressional reporter Kelsey Snell White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political reporter Tim Mak everybody hey there right\nSo it's pretty clear by these slim midst of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking that she was going to be supporting cabinet\nAnd then just a few minutes later Joe Manchin the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cabinet and that brought us to very clearly locked in yes votes\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment but fifty one forty nine is how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nIt did look that way there was a ... a few moments where we were chasing around Senator Tim and I were standing and different hallways different parts of the capital trying to find people like Senator Jeff Flake a Republican of Arizona and counting we mentioned the mansion\nTo see if they were going to stick with their votes\nUm flake with a little bit cryptic we didn't really know what was going to happen and then ... and had lunch with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and he came out saying that he felt pretty good about things and from there it seems like we're heading in that direction where the fifty one votes were going to quickly come into place\nTim friday was a really tense day on Capitol Hill it's been a really tense week on Capitol Hill scenes Jeff Flake negotiated this delay this one we\nGet these people will tell her and these are held we will never know why and if we\n[noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme laying out races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate race ... with us as well as the ... and Dominican so walk us\nThrough what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where the Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson is facing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman carrying yes wise I actually had met her before\nDuring the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump he told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning when he was governor for electing\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had her she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane but\nHe's showing me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nStill you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now\nAnd the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within this community have said hey look maybe he does\nSupport for an HBO ... comes from you our members and from Dartmouth Hitchcock imagine nationally ranks healthcare in your community was convenient location throughout northern New England world class providers are closer than you think\nIs at Dartmouth Hitchcock dot org to learn more starting with Hitchcock is here\nLike you noted has been there a number of times so this is a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week asked me you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate he should point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station he was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and bill now saying basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hard line on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill Nelson really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country that's really the case here in Florida as well because this is not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact\nOn the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls or he's letting last for ... for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said is the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and was killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line\nOr an incentive to Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay an arrow race between now and election day this is one of the most fifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country or Dominican mountain are Oh

broadcast through the mid term elections so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it being the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans and suddenly talking about a backlash to all of that the ...\nJihad against this innocent members grew to be married\nWe're finding now that the the the viewer a white male it's okay to be against white guys you're out you're\nDoing this old garbage and pay for them in this poll showed male voters are suddenly\nEnergize because I think it could easily as well turn out to me the era of the man who feel like the target is on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person was never meant\nThat I just things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job I don't know what to do [noise]\nMom what do I do what do I do mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks\nWe've got White House correspondent Tamara Keith political correspondent Asma Khalid and political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody\nHey hey there I was going to ... we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this you saw President Trump act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nBut certainly she was a very credible which says well\nGuess what that changed in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a\nTwelve point uptick enthusiasm among Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election it was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that's eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men yeah what stood out to me in in that poll was\nIn what's called the generic ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow they were more likely to vote for Republicans than for a Democrat just in the past week yes they\nAre just going in the past week and that is absolutely has everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash\nThat has taken place you know they're so much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus following the hearing was on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and that there was a big surge in campaign donations\nBut there was something else happening two men were angry\nTam we just heard all of those uh clips of President Trump over the last few days you just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump\nNot only is it not a new thing from President Trump it's not a new thing in American culture and politics so President Trump really ran on some of this grievance and and some of this\nFear among people are particularly among white Republican men that the culture has shifted beneath them that you know that\nOf energy among Republicans and then it goes well or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of liquor python and anger as ... as a motivating factor is much stronger in the moment than it is among them\nThat's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks everybody You're welcome You're welcome [noise]\nThis is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed and to do that\nWe always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you got some of the things we're going to talk about what had been big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett\nKavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nAuthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum coverage is giving a bigger seats in Congress has not giving you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nTo do that also to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for each cigarette you might not have thought they were allowed but they haven't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAnd another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated this Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week perhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott as ...\nBig big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority they're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment and they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller okay\nShifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base it that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send to investors and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences\nYou can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world but and fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a\nPlan for for people who live in a country with that same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt around that's\nNPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics
