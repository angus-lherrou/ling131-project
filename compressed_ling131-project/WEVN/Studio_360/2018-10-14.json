left wing mob Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern Republicans believe in the rule of law not the rule of the\nMob vote Republican exclamation exclamation point yeah and\nAnd I just say that line in his speech it was not improvised that was written down\nThis is very intentional right this is coming from them and it's it's kind of a strategy I was talking to Frank Luntz\nWho is a a well known Republican pollster and he said that he has advise Republicans to uses language he says because he feels like it's an accurate description of the protesters at the Kavanaugh hearings and all the way that they were behaving\nAnd Kelsey Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is also using this language and particularly upset about those protests um and you know people following senators in the hallway to to try to make their point in the lead up to the the cabinet vote\nYeah that's absolutely right and well he's been talking about a lot the past couple of days\nThey all consuming and I'm also very toward Islam and independent of all the book\nAt all the buildings go\nBefore the law is loaded up\nAnd it's something that he and I talked about when I sat down with him in his office\nYou've called Democrats an angry mob essentially even to use her mob\nEver since that upset it has been in play Republicans every two years have run a campaign that have come close to winning\nThey're very optimistic this time around because Donald Trump last Minnesota but one by almost sixteen percentage points in the eighth district they think this area is one of the best if not the best chance for them to flip a seat\nYeah I mean this district is heavily union white working class it was actually the largest wing of any district in the country from President Obama to President Trump\nAnd the demographics\nTell a lot of that store owner and they do and the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing with it with Donald Trump's blessing the president was here in June campaigning for him\nDemocrats on the other hand were taken by surprise when Rick Nolan said he wouldn't seek reelection earlier this year they fought a primary battle resented which came out on top but that was just mid August so stoppers had a significant jump on Democrats at least when it comes to campaigning\nMark what are the issues at play mining is a big\nIssue up in the eighth district the third party candidate is talking about opposing the mind he says it could threaten the water resources that could have a

[noise]\nOn the air with a special broadcast\nEvery week through the mid term elections breaking down the major themes we're seeing that\nI Need you to get your friends your family get your ... your coworkers did vote Republican\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm is hot bed of history as a guide most Americans won't vote in the mid term even when they're eligible one of the reasons why I haven't looked at as soon as I say that I'm always busy\nBeing away from home I don't feel connected to the political system I don't believe that it actually is effective\nToday we're going to look at who isn't boating why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR's Dominican ... and ... holiday hey guys\nThere hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority well not the right and that's the whole thing it's between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off a between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base ...\nWas because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut ... why aren't they voting the it's complicated right like some of it is because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is rigged I mean I can cook kind of on and on it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also is\nThere are some people who actually just obstructed from voting like they they want to vote but they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of not feeling like their vote matters but also not really\nCaring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerged and that's what I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for the audience sure\nSure I mean so the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundits talk about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it's even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a writer on the Las Vegas strip and\nWhy it went there in particular was it had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen\nAnd is it Eighteen to twenty five or twenty nine year old is how they oh wow that's not even that young and it was a young guy I met his name is ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd you know he basically was very confused with the system he initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nOr never voted before Moore has a somewhat on voting is on your show up to the whole place and he's all but I don't know what I Need to bring on an even knew or happens during or\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think to him like he wasn't the only person who expressed this confusion with how you vote\nWhich I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies this is\nSort of things that we assume people knew but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy\nEighteen to twenty nine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections and mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year olds Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen than spike back up to Nineteen percent\nDuring the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nWhy is that I feel like I've heard a couple of big theories one being that a lot of young people are very transient so they don't feel attached to that particular place that they live in and she'll be Mavis actually mentioned this to me he's originally from Missouri he thinks he registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached\nTo Nevada and he felt like he didn't know much about Nevada politics and this is something that I Would say we hear a lot about the other big thing I've heard a lot from young people about its transportation and just sort of logistics of trying to get to the polls and they may not be stakeholders either younger voters\nAnd that they don't have kids in the schools like ... there are things that happen later in your life they get you more engaged in politics even at just at the local law but there's also this belief that they don't think that they know enough which I Wonder if the if this is a factor of just being young when you look at surveys you'll see a large percentage of young people say that they don't think they know enough\nYou could have this for three months as a kind of absolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement\nOf the Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd uh so they said why just three months or let's let them go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations remain in place\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans\nThese plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get\nPerhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars in patients from the larger insurance pool that makes Obamacare worked so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law that they couldn't reveal\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we might have meant because of all the other news is

going to be here with a special broadcast breaking down the issues on voters fine [noise]\nWith James just figures sex\nIn the history of our church\nRepublicans once thought the major tax cut they've had we'd be their best selling point headed into the midterms\nThink voters are on their side on this issue it's an all out looting of America\nThe wholesale robbery of the middle class we're going to dig into the policy of the big\nTax law and how that's affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered this more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are you going to be with you\nSo Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed this thing let's talk about what was in it can you give us a quick recap of what was in this big tax bill\nYeah the big top line thing that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate for thirty five percent a Twenty one percent they also made things a little bit simpler for individuals they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes\nAnd they doubled the child tax credit\nBut they also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction it's that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments\nThey can deduct that well they were Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill and check they put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write some of that off\nThat is also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread on evenly across people with different income brackets\nJust got this has been the law of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact you\nTo say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing story\nMost economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month [noise]\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economists and the c._e._o. forecasters they think this is a short lived sugar high that people are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional Paul\nYeah they're the non partisan officials score keepers for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House saying no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings put that into new plants new equipment\nNew machinery that's going to make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nSo basically we're going to go into the midterm elections we're people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kind of high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the deficit is expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about it either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans wanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to use\nAnd so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means the government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats as they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to re people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed also campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for this tax bill for months and months and the polling average that they use of aren't real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nIn you know the tax cut it had kind of a a momentary\nHigh watermark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers are and and for a ... a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval\nBut that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent or lower and that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut\nIs that where it's going to be a as we approached the midterm elections they would be disappointed no that's where it wound up\nIs the tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nWell again Democrats are going to continue messing ... messaging tax cuts as the binary to win the no Republicans wanting to cut other things that Democrats like like health care like Social Security like Medicare they will continue to message it that way and you know Republicans may be hoping\nIn twenty Eighteen but maybe twenty twenty\nI think you're going to continue to hear competing narratives Republicans will talk about this\nAs an investment in the health of the U.S economy that will pay for that will pay dividends in the long term Democrats will talk about it as a deficit ballooning give away to the rich that's going to put the squeeze on entitlement programs
