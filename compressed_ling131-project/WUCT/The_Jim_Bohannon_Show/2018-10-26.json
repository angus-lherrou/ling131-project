[noise] well\nThere's a reason I have a new council now and I'm looking at all options to fight this and are really as I said on a TV earlier with you I just want to make sure that what happened to me never again happens to any American and if I'm going to fight this was not just for myself it's for any American citizen who might be targeted lawfully Ron lawfully by our own government\nSo you're looking to possibly overturned that play up to get back absolutely that is a risk with that\nThere's a risk but you know what it's a it's a it's a worthy of risk because um my reputations on the line I think the integrity of his entire investigations on the line and sometimes you have to think of the greater good and not just yourself who's your interaction with the Mueller probe like bomb I really can't get into too many details about my exact interactions with them but um as I said I'm looking to fight this right now so\nAh the the ... going to come out with a whole bunch of indictments evidently after the midterm elections if it's based on George Papadopoulos and they build from there what's your message to the ... um I have\nAbsolutely no idea who they are looking at or what they might be doing all I Do speak for myself and the um if ... as I stated earlier I was targeted by western intelligence or was absolutely no reason I should have been prosecuted here is a Mark Meadows cuts thirty for\nWhat's troubling for me is today a there is even a greater confirmation in my mind that there was inappropriate behavior on behalf\nOf the FBI and the OJ as they initiated this investigation is they continued with the investigation and as they continue to not give information to [noise] or whether it's Mr path adopt list as counsel for the American people are Congress\nBecause you have to put this together and you're you're not giving you information about you\nA ... blood if it wasn't for the great work of a certain reporters [laughter] I to this day I don't think anyone in this country let alone me or any council of mine would have known that there was this exculpatory evidence\nYou see a very interesting that this myth seated at the helper a downer or the one thing in common they don't like President Trump and from ... myth seed work to seems with Christopher Steele to on earth to corrupt\nHow Cruz to steal got the trust of the FBI and now they're working together to get you into Trump\nIt's insane I mean it's absolutely crazy how what I wandered into and I'm just surprised a you know I wasn't looking at a lot worse charges because probably my\nMy I got was right on a ... a lot of these meetings George I really love that you came in here sorry you had to go through that will talk to you again soon done much start to our next we'll have you back so much\n\nTime to begin filling their shoe boxes again for operation Christmas Child this is an international relief program whose mission is to provide gifts are small toys hygiene at him and still supplies for children affected by poverty natural disaster famine and to just fill the shoe box with these Adams and bring it to First Baptist\nSo the GDP it when it was a four point to last quarter and a half three point five to two very good numbers\nBut now you have the tax cut and the original premise was hey are Republicans running the tax cut and the new one is we could this caravan and the immigration and this is what we're talking about and it's not a ... it's not a what if it is it's happening\nThe Republicans running on the right thing\nWell look this election is all about Donald Trump just like a Michael Steele was suggesting\nMaybe not the way he was interpreting it but Trump has placed himself at the center of this election he was going to be the center anyway Democrats would have made in the center of it if he had made in the center of it\nAnd most votes are going to be cast in reference to him that's not to say that issues don't play a big part they do for Republicans or immigration has been at the top of the list for three years and that's why the caravan you know what I hear people say the Democrats funded the care of it\n'cause it's helping candidates it's putting immigration front and center right at the critical moment of the campaign the final days of a campaign so Kavanaugh the caravan\nAnd Trump himself that is that's what's driving the Republican side and to some degree the Democratic side\nWhich drew down on this is what Democrats have been saying some current trouble exist in the majority of non white districts were Democrats worry about turning out the Hispanic vote they have largely given up hope of an seeding will hurt you know who goes against the president on the wall and other things in these uh CIA guy remarkably competent and diverse\nBut and and and another uh now into a over also in California\nSo what's going on for your numbers tell you about the Hispanic vote in America\nWell there's great concern I Know on the Democratic side about getting a good turnout because they didn't get it and twenty six teams I mean it was Hispanics African Americans\nAnd millennials who did not turn out it anywhere\nClose to the ... they were expected to and of course that made the difference so they've detected relatively low interest among Hispanics in the mid term election and and normally frankly\nUh minorities and millennials don't participate in the mid term so that's kind of a built in structural advantages for the Republicans [noise] uh so you've always got accepted as you mentioned will heard what parties need to do and they have done to a certain degree is to allow the district to dictate the nominee\nAnd in the case of will hurt that's a moderate district relatively speaking closed competitive modern district and will hurt has played that correctly he's he has used the issues that help him in avoided the issues that hurt him and that's why he's the favorite\nDoes that make sense and by the way we need people like this who are going to you to have the lucrative security careers I got a chance to know I'm a little bit but they go back in the service where it's pay okay but you go to places on a regular basis\nYou know you it's truly service and for Republicans to criticize will hurt I'm thinking to myself what do you want in a candidate they all can't be speaking from the same him she then you're not serving the country do you agree Dr ... well\nYeah and also you can actually get a majority if you insist on that you can't have everybody looking and sounding exactly alike this is a very diverse country and so you have to adjust the nominee to the district and and really vice versa during gerrymandering but\nAnd you're right look people think that Congress Miller very well off and so and it's all of them are some of them are very wealthy before they come in\nBut for relatively average people of modest means and they're quite a few of them in Congress it's a struggle to ruin a household in DC and another household at home because frankly Brian not everybody makes you kind of money\nRight uh exactly except not even close not even close brown and you know how did he gets goes up and smell handling yeah well\nWe're not he's probably doing just a little bit better so he owes you\nRight now yes and put it this way my helicopter is not a new when he gets a new helicopter he leases them online I bought an old during an refurbish\n... for me I insist on a new job every year to contract\nAll right so having said that when we leave transportation for just a second and again I blame you for getting us off track and add to that I'm a hundred percent correct yes Peter\nPromised means go cut that part of who is ever have a record of who is Peter I got to meet him he's yeah he's he's one of your of hundreds of assistance exact they're running some machine\nTom ... runs the DNC tell me if he's playing a game or is he really worried\nWe will look at their ... and it was going to be close I I don't use the term ... I I always talk\nTalk about this blue wave and all that so I don't believe I happen to think\nOf a lecture night you're going to find a very very close situation in maybe a handful of votes determining whether Democrats\nAre getting control of the house and so\nAre they just plain down expectations Bernie Sanders ... just a pushing aside the blue wave trying to motivate people\nAnd it well it's both really I mean basically they're saying ah I'm having flashbacks twenty sixteen I'm afraid\nThe other half of it is a they have to insist that the election is very very close to get there are people out because many Democrats aren't used to participating in midterms so it's it's a bit of both are in the middle of the night there having the twenty sixteen flashbacks\nDuring the day they're trying to motivate the Democratic party constituencies\nIt's hard to comment on breaking news but we found another package on this one to James Clapper in New York City when I started the show walking upstairs they found they looked like another package was heading to Cory Booker\nI Do hear that they are close to an arrest but so far that hasn't stopped the packages that were seemed to have been put in a put in place some point this week when you look at this and we hope no one's heard and they seem to be a bomb making material but no there's no neither there and know blasting cap thankfully\nBut having said that who does this play more for the the the Democrats who say that the president's language is causing this or the Republicans who are security a party\nI Want to see who it is and maybe it's a person maybe as persons that you gave me some good news I realize they were close to an arrest I'm thrilled to hear that\nBecause this is intolerable I God Knows I Hope that one hundred percent or maybe Ninety nine percent knowing knowing our country as we do Ninety nine percent would agree this is absolutely unacceptable this goes way beyond the bounds of of anybody's definition of a discourse in politics\nSo let's find out who did it let's find out what the motives were then we can assess\nThe damage if there is any maybe there won't be any effect at all politically but we have to know who it is and what the motives were\nSo how could a president and I asked this question yesterday without creating a great answers to all the pressures on you\nA president who's had three uh three hit books on it from ... to Michael Wolff to Bob Woodward he had an anonymous staffer write an editorial talking about how incompetent tea is he's had multiple people like Tillerson and reportedly Kelly basically Komen idiot\nBut yet he is now at forty seven percent of the wall Street Journal NBC and forty four percent according to CNN approval that just about just above President Obama how did and now he's ... and now he's trying to nationalize this election and making about himself\nI Know we have to rewrite and rethink everything in the Donald Trump era but can you make sense of that\nSure he made that connection with his people the people the forty six percent who voted for him that has endured of course you also have to say he made a connection with the people who didn't vote for and that is also endured people made up their minds about Donald Trump a long time ago this additional information you just mentioned the up much of it\nIt makes no difference if you're for him you're really for him if you're against him you're really against him I've yet to meet anybody in the middle\nYou do need um you polled them I mean independents are undecideds you know did they say\nNo but they're they've already made up their minds about Donald Trump they may not have made up their minds about who they're going to vote for in this midterm election because after all while Donald Trump is is center\nThe candidates matter their issues matter the ah the states in districts matter so uh you once again you're over generalizing Brian and I guess this is leading back to another discussion in another plug for your book\nNo I think that you are becoming more belligerent than Chris Wallace on the show and I didn't think that was possible this is really a blizzard as Chris\nWhile I asked well I'll tell you I really didn't give me a run for the money that hits them getting and really hurting my self esteem I don't know I've had the confidence to have a good weekend we'll\nGive it over to your staff let them have turned out the Mike I'd like to see how they do\nBut you know I I don't if I knew who they were it would definitely how is that right now if you look at your crystal ball how how many seats are sure how many are up for grabs in the house\nWell we don't have either party over to a team we've been very very cautious\nAnd that means the remaining tossup as we think twenty twenty two remaining tossup that's where the election will be decided I don't see a suit me I don't see a big blue wave I said that for a long time I've been very consistent\nNext news in one hour or online news talk Ninety four one dot com [noise]\nYou see the news on the hour sponsored by Sarah works relief I'm Jim jailer

streaming and I also do the Facebook Live some part during\nAh during Fox in France So a lot of people comment on that house maybe get some comments up but let's go out to Scott listening on Facebook or watching it on Facebook ... got\nA Brian how you doing good what's your name on\nCrime and if I Am a a Desert Storm work that I Am black I Am a conservative and I am a national is just like President Trump cause I Believe in marriage in first and I don't understand why the Democrats don't they say why\nThey're there to serve the ... that there are served this country\nBut yet they create chaos confusion in the fight ... fight getting married you know could have done if he had their support anything\n[noise] I I agree I mean at all I'm going to I mean it's got to\nJust to push back a little bit I Love when the president brought those cameras in and go get it on camera especially when it came to guns and we came to immigration\nAnd a lot of people going to be mad at me but I Would not have minded if the president got his twenty five billion for the wall and exchange for giving the DACA or the DACA kids now young adults a ten year path to citizenship\nI Would not um I did that because then you go back and you realize the chain and lottery or something even Democrats aren't very they aren't necessarily against blue in the beginning of possibly a cascade of deals now I'm being optimistic\nBut they said the Democrats they feared he was going to start with infrastructure why\nBecause that would have made them play ball\nInstead it was his fourth or fifth thing and they said well you know why we we just we don't like what he's doing you know with this tax plan and everything else so we're not going to participate Scott if you get old house and Senate I think they're going to get stuff done I think they're going to get stuff done if they could hold the house and Senate by any margin\nI think so too I think so too I mean just the first time since I guess since\nReagan that I've been optimistic about America and the benefits of marriage is that like a week you know the president is doing these amazing that that in there were just took desire to do right and he put a lot\nWhen I say she didn't hurt is great equal here will do a lot to do this and what people being able to cope with their own special one heat and you only want ... ... oh he's doing we built this world\nIn so many different ways Greek we should feel our sovereignty to anyone because you're ... your book about Andrew jak yeah even though I agree with a lot of ... was about when it came to cross the line but I Love the way he attacked the ...\nI Love to write this ... thing is he was about America and there's no question about that he was not for his fame and acclaim back in a moment thanks great call\n\nTake off your Saturday here coast to coast nothing but football all day long for\nAlmost immediately whether something is a viable device or not unless the authorities in New York have said these are not hoaxes these are potentially viable devices um but not one has\nGone off and apparently none of the packaging the way that normally they would expect something like this to be done if they actually want to hurt or killed people is it the packages booby trapped to go off when you open it they said that wasn't part of it either so\nHe's adjust to strictly in the work quote terrorizing me to instill terror and people to frighten people\nOr is it actually about harming people I mean these are two very very different objectives and I think they know a lot more about that then they're saying at this\nPoint you're talking to show to remove by the way as those who were attorney handles or legal stuff here not my personal stuff you will notarized anything and that bothers me\nHe won't hey I'm Eric stance are free\nDon't you feel bad uh charging as a notary\nI don't I don't know like anger that I Need that four dollars and it makes a difference for me so if you want your document I'm going to need the four\nDollar does fun so a lot of people are saying the president should have taken a more conciliatory tone a stump speech when he said he's fighting back and he's saying listen maybe if you weren't ripping mean Ninety two percent of the time going just at CNN and MSNBC you wouldn't create so much heat usual Rush Limbaugh said coach his team\nGoes there or not they are trying to pass responsibility and there's lots of Donald Trump in and trying to get us to shut up\nIn response and in opposition to we're supposed to sit here is that oh no no no and we know the facts recap comment while they comment left and right and start ragged on Trump for his supporters or what have your while we're supposed to sit here and be polite and have good manners and not say anything about it\nAnd the the for the most part I Am stunned I thought on the Sunday show to get a lot of opinion and talking about President Trump's tone and Maxine Waters and the horrible comments Eric Holder said we're going to kick 'em and the mixture you know this was happening hours after the packages were found Shannon\n... so you're going to get worse until we find the guy\nIt's interesting because guide Benson a wrote a piece in town hall yesterday and he pointed to some um [noise] video of Nancy Pelosi after the shooting that nearly killed these ... and she was in a press conference and it it must\nHave been within a day or two after this had happened the shooting it happened and she asked about those who are trying to link this to potentially someone on the left or somebody who was upset by the Democrats which we now know exactly\nHow that played out and her comments where this is outrageous how dare dare you go there this is disgusting this was a terrible event how dare you make any links between political\nIdeology or try to blame this on anyone but for the president for the White House they feel like that's exactly what's happening to them by now I mean we had a guest on last\nUm who was the deputy chair of the DNC or vice chair and Michael I'm Blake and he started immediately saying with the president bear some responsibility to this and I said wait a minute what exactly are you saying I mean the person who put these devices together and mailed them and put them into the stream to try it frightened people or wherever the objective was\nThat's the person who's responsible for this\nAnd the president actually did this I said but what you're saying is the president's bears some responsibility for this and you have to be very clear about that because you know and those conversations in the weeks a after ... was almost killed\nThere were a lot of folks who are objecting and saying it's not fair to tigers to a particular party and the truth is it is the individual who pulled the trigger or makes device that is ultimately the person that is very troubled and has a problem and they're the ones\nUh left or right or center or if they're just disturbed in some way they're the ones who's made who have made this decision to um put these things in a place like\nI said the uh that that's a big topic or the other topic of course the midterms and the caravan but I Want to bring into the robber mode of education because on radio and TV we had George Papadopoulos remembers the twenty eight now thirty one year old who was a unpaid foreign policy advisor who pled guilty to lying to the FBI\nNow he's starting to put his whole the series of events together and he believes the D. O. J. and the FBI along with three separate countries combined to set him up\nBecause they didn't want to be president only did become president they wanted to hurt him and he uses evidence of actor John ... of his original contact those original contact in England it was a multi professor and now we find out a working for British Intelligence\nAnd then we find out to the ambassador down are avid says Clinton ties also supposed to be linked to Australian and British Intelligence\nAnd now we also find out that stepping help or an American who worked for the FBI all targeted him while he sat in house arrest in Chicago apartment watching all this money go out the window\nHe wants to know over a overturn a overturned his conviction in his ... he's with Mark Meadows said after going after hearing what he had to say behind closed doors yesterday and the committee hearing cut thirty two\nI can tell you that I Am very trouble that his Fourth Amendment rights may have been violated in the way that this was conducted was certainly inappropriate and not what we would believe to be standard protocol for the FBI\nDidn't like it and he went on cut thirty three\nYou know listen I have if he testifies publicly based on what we just heard today uh I think the American people would Woodside with George Papadopoulos uh uh regardless of party or when you hear it and and yet I don't I don't see a public hearing happening just to be Frank\nNot happening but he was pretty move by what he heard behind closed doors what are you hearing 'cause he's starting to realize that all these people were setting them up\nI think it's really interesting your interview this morning I'm which of course that was on a wait to see it but I read the transcripts or he lays out a very interesting set of events and circumstances in people and timing that rain is a lot of questions I think for anybody who had a real desire to know exactly what what's happening with it\nThat's the case and how it got started\nUm who the players or what the aim was I mean what he lays out he makes a good case for himself and for the you know his theory that he was being set up in an effort to um to then be able to go after the Trump campaign in some way or the president himself said he when\nI'm I think people should listen to what he has to say and and make a judgment about it but you know he's drawing some links and connecting the dots a in a way that I think raise a lot of very very serious question\nAnd I'll paraphrase shine and he said that one of the tweets that Peter Struck had\nA was a that he goes we are beginning to what our source or or or Russian source or or source in England where in Britain is beginning to talk about Russia connections\nIt was the same day that ambassador down or a it was the day after he met with the ... down and he ended up being a tape conversation to somehow Peter Struck get that\nOn the Russian source original source I Know rushing connections to mix it came up to me an approach me and asked me if I if they told me that Hillary Clinton's emails were about to be released\nSo then he gets an information unsolicited and then these asset by donor who turns out he's a British asset who gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and Australian of more than just an ambassador\nSo he chose you not and he says will data was even nice she goes he was he was very aggressive towards me told me as you walk away from Trump these horrible person that we've never going to get elected so\nI'm listening to all this they're all connected together you know it's something else to this cruise to re steel made his name by investigating the world cup and exposing corruption right\nGuess who was a member of the world cup community ...\nYears who do not get charged lifted and he's one of the few not to charge so there's a relationship there before Donald Trump was even running for president so yeah I mean it's a it's a drama that you can't believe that that actually probably took place\nRight if it was scripted as a movie [laughter] I keep all might say like this is just too fantastical I mean it's just all of the different links and all of the different connection and you think about this guy twenty eight years old at the time I mean thought he was doing a good thing by\nUm you know helping out at a campaign and the candidate that he's very much believed in it sounds like he's still very much does do believe in\nUm the ad but feeling that now that he was a pawn in this situation and that's that's highly possible I mean when you think about\nThe level of sophistication of the people that he was interacting with and their connection to each other\nUm it just raises so many questions along the way I'm sure you've thought as many Americans have thought I'm with things that have been uncovered you think about what would these people thinking at the time some of these key players and it's only can be that they just assumed like most people did there was no way that Hillary Clinton wouldn't become president\nBecause some of these things are so sloppy and questionable you think they could not have ever thought they were going to have to answer for some of these things right\nHe's the insurance plan he believes anyway so here he is when he realized just a couple of weeks ago that according to his lawyers mistreat is a British uh works for British Intelligence listen\nTo saw infamous professor Joseph ... professor that are just a couple of days ago a multi\nDecember the ... were living in London and as a professor exactly\nI'm living in London tied to all these western intelligence groups but then uh you know he starts to present himself as a Russia Insider and basically a couple of days ago his own lawyer one public and stated that he was working for the FBI not Russia so it's very confusing I don't understand why his own lawyer would make such a statement if it is false I don't believe it's faulty\n... I mean his his his head is spinning mhm so because", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Algood", "day": "26"}
