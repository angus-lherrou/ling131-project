go to AA meetings or get a morning show and then you have\nAnd a bit but there's rarely a morning where I don't get up not happy they did to be at it I mean because I Love doing this so much and there's so much news it's just a ton of fun\nRight so what does your does but how much does a immigration illegal immigration legal immigration how much does it matter that people to Florida to the people who listen to you it because they say it's a three to one of the three big issue\nIt's I wouldn't say it's the largest issue here because we don't see it but it's definitely high on people don't like the a lack of security on the border more than anything is not we don't see the immigration problem is you're likely due out west\nRight you know I was out there ten Fifteen Years ago to go into a a ski resorts and and I I saw them people from all over the world these different groups of folks coming in and I was telling people here in Florida I say the west coast is not look like Florida and it's coming this way\nAnd so people are hearing about it and the news right now and the lack of security along the borders everybody gets that ... that's a big issue\nSo you got to two races that have the whole country looking you look at a governor Rick Scott wants to be centers gotten take notes and seeing it looks like a virtual dead heat can you give us a sense on the ground in Florida how you think it's going\nGovernor Scott started out very unpopular in slowly become popular he's he's he's been at it in a people like him he's done a great job with the economy is said let's get to work and he spoke laser focused on that and then he's shown himself to be a tremendous administrator\nDuring hurricane recovery and his polls have started to come up he suspended his campaign in his ... started to come up because he's getting this great free advertising showing what he's good at hurricane might he's he's he's handling a he's doing a fantastic job of there\nSo you have a round to say it as soon as making his name a military background making his name on Foreign Relations really ah like Jim Jordan and others are taking on what's going on the FBI and the investigation of Donald Trump but then he says I'm going to run for governor and the president says he got my I got your back\nBut yet he wants to continue more of Rick Scott's policies that has this a state really rolling and killing doesn't the mayor of Tallahassee he's got an FBI investigation Tallahassee is not a smooth during operation but he's got a lot of charisma and poise on the stump why do you think this is a dead heat [noise]\nBecause we're a purple state no other reason than that I was talking to congressman Dan Webster is one of our two main Congress and for the major coast area yesterday and I asked him that same question I I that I said why is going to ask me there's what do you say and he says because we're a purple state that's the only reason\nBut the word is getting out on what Gillum stands for and I said at the very beginning forget these polls\nThis guy's a socialist and AIDS the war's going to get out into the saddest will be able to just tell the truth about him and his poll numbers have come up and get almost will go down I think there'll be tight but I think the Santa has it\nBut one thing about Florida I thought it was Democrats or Republicans were coming here because of the tax situation yeah and that's a little change or ... made it clear on raising taxes\nFor retirees come down here from New York and they don't want to pay taxes on I don't blame and things are a lot cheaper here and he wants to raise the prices make it more expensive ...\nRight and I'm surprised that resonates in a state like this\nI don't think the issues are resonating at all and I think it's just that we are fifty fifty Republican Democrat and there is course across the nation\nAnd a lot of states they very anti Trump right man coalitions not everywhere but it it's you know Florida is fifty fifty now I'll be I'll be honest with you I don't know anybody that is a liberal that that is like the ones we see portrayed on TV Now maybe that's because of the circles by running but I don't know where those people are here in Florida\nRight you're saying that uh the people that support Gillum you don't know them at all so that I live in an area where they are they're all Republican right so that All right\nEnd up here we are very conservative here but I'm I'm moving to Alachua County University of Florida and uh they're liberal up there and I don't hear in a big buzz prevail I'm but I Would imagine there is more so than here great time to be a talk radio host in Florida absolutely sure it's always a great time in Florida is a great time regardless\nWay like

Cumberland if France had cameras and she died um\nGators peacefully found off on their team all find bomb news talk Ninety four point one [noise]\nSo as rally overnight in addition to the glorification of violence against journalists\nNothing alike glorifying violence against journalists nothing like making a joke at a body slamming reporter what another journalists were dismembered his fingers cut off three weeks ago\nAnd that is John ... who does that happen to the president was talking about energy and forte\nThis guy a gene for taking these congressmen who took Ryan Zinke he seat\nWell before the special election he body slammed her report which we know is wrong but the president referenced it last night and they're saying wow how could you do that no one could show he was killed and he was a reporter to\nDo you know the president he's not looking at the relation between the two weeks working a live audience who waited a long time to get in and he was just talking about what a local politician did there was a bizarre but I don't think he was supporting it that's the way he\nTalks that's the way he rose he wasn't thinking ...\nDo you believe it was inappropriate on another note let's go to the phones Bob listening ah news Ninety six Wagner land do hey Bob\n[noise] hey I got five things a George Foreman I worked with George Foreman for two weeks they fought Scotland too\nAnd he is a real man he said he's just a way it comes to costs on us and just like you Brian you know and I really didn't like that of course I was talking about honesty one aide said\nA ... and oh I'm In Leningrad when he was really in St Petersburg remember that\nYes I did but he was trying to win the lottery booting over\nTen after him was eight and a half and here's a ... has had a quick Saudi thing you're you're ... you're right about that is terrible about killing women and show\nBut looking in the sixties John McCain was a baby killer and they were screaming about em dropping bombs on on on the Vietnamese you know everything's just same Brian I've been on a street for Thirty years you're going to find out a show and all the Paso or chair you're sitting in\nHow you come across\nWell thanks a lot of ... what happened is of course the Vietnam War there was a draft there was a lot of resentment for that war and they started getting mad at our airmen the air force members as well as a our army they say well you're killing kids because a lot of the video images brought back with that but that wasn't the reality on the ground things that happened were casualties of war\nAnd hopefully we got past that period but they were talking about air force pilots as doing that\nBut no one ever thought um is is that I cannot justify what happened Saudi Arabia that's not going to be okay they will receive ramifications for this and on top of that the president's already made it clear um that he died they know it so now we've got to figure out how the Saudis are going to\nOwn up to it when we come back we're going to be joined by Katie woman or the the spokesperson for the department of homeland security she knows the loopholes in the catch and release other reasons behind this caravan in so many problems that are ...\nHim out and support the peach tree Christmas market place for North while not avenues and cook them each\nYou find is relatively aggravating because don't focus on the care of and the care of it is just one issue you're dealing with that on the border on a daily basis and your bill helpless\nRight now you know we're seeing a caravan coming towards the United states\nOf about four thousand people right that's what the news is reporting we're apprehending about two thousand on the border each and every single day that's where you know the men and women have CBP and border patrol or apprehending them but there's not much recourse they can do wants to apprehend then were forced to release because not only are detention centers\nFilling up but then even if we do you know keep the family and it's in detention we can't do anything with them since twenty days is too short of a period to be able to adjudicate and removed from our country the best attorneys removal and we don't have that ability right\nNow do you do you think the word is out on these loopholes in central and South America\nOh these smugglers traffickers no our laws better than members of Congress\nI mean it is the most shocking that I've seen recently\nUm is that you know from two thousand sixteen to now more men are coming across the border with children than ever before\nYou know and twenty sixteen it was about six thousand men came across the border with children today it's up to sixteen thousand which says that people know that if they bring a child you will be released in the United states and there's little or no chance for a move off\nSo I Want you to you David to forage did on TALK of the other night he's a former President Obama's State Department official\nWe're talking about illegal my immigration right and illegal immigration has gone down for Mexico and it couldn't go down for Honduras and Guatemala and other countries in Central America we improve those economies we only give a little bit of money so let's help improve those economies are they really are going fully employed employed there and we need to pay more\n[noise] so you heard Tucker sarcasm but that is the feeling that if we just gave these people more aid they stay home\n[laughter] you know the number one and number two reasons that you know border patrol has found when they interview folks at the border to come to the United states you know what's driving them number one is reunification and number two and economic opportunity\nThat is not because they feel unsafe than not because the economy is not great they really want to come to the United states you know if if you're truly seeking\nYou know ... if you're ... persecution and your fleeing no reason why you cannot remain in your home country why not stop and Mexico but they don't stop and Mexico they continue on to the United states you know I was just at the border a couple of weeks ago\nHad a chance when we apprehended a family unit you ask why are you coming to the United states I'd like to meet up with my brother who's living illegally in Richmond, Virginia\nWell so we're seeing that's what you're seeing so drawn um oh good good year is is um he he is Mexico's investments in the United states he was on our general yesterday I Want you hear what he said about the Caribbean ... to\nHave evidence that or this carbon is also very much politically motivated so we're not we all lose your sense of the humanitarian situation that we encounter and we're acting precisely what we we have also made very clear that there is no legal ground on which\nThey'll go through my school board so you know I think so but they do they let them through and the care of in some of that has been sponsored by some enemies of our state but on both those issues first off who put this carbon together\nI mean this camera and is being put together by NGOs and others\nUm mainly for media attention I mean as I said we're seeing caravan side every day at the border you know we've heard reports of these folks getting on buses and then getting off and walking for the cameras you know they are getting a ton of media attention and it is at least putting a spotlight on a loop\nHole the serious loopholes and us immigration law that once again is you know at least being slashed on everyone's TV screen to know just what a crisis it is at the border day in and day out\nCan Mexico do more\n[noise] you know Mexican ... Mexico's definitely taking steps to address the humanitarian issue but yes you know these Mexican cartels control the entire U.S Mexico border I feel comfortable saying that you know predominantly\nYou have to pay a smuggler or traffic or about five thousand dollars is the going rate right now to get across the U.S border\nSo there is a two point five billion dollar industry for these traffickers they smuggler these cartels to get people across the border illegally that it's happening in Mexico right now\nYou are speaking to know a kid he's dealing with this on a regular basis or we have a duty woman here the spokesperson so Dianne Feinstein does not only does she not regret the two thousand a law that pushing for central and south Americans to come here and stay\nShe says if she if she gets her party gets empower the she put on fixing the law or or and bring it up\n[noise] you know I'd have to say that we really do need Congress to act in a closed these loopholes because if not if you just continue to see more of the same that is four hundred thousand you know I just said that a hundred thousand people apprehended at the border last year they're all here today we're going to continue to see it as an influx\nOf family unit an influx of unaccompanied alien children because if you keep screaming work does emptying you from the law were exempting you from any consequences you're gonna continue to see people come in and it's up to Congress now to close loopholes\nJudy I just don't understand if the if the Democrats see this happening it's not good not a good issue for them to let people think that people can fought our borders and get into our country so why don't they want to fix this I understand that they have this thing for the wall they don't want to get the prisoner victory but why don't they want to fix catch and release\nThis seems like common sense to me but maybe it's just a fundamental misunderstanding of the way US law works I mean to me it makes perfect sense that if you have a you know a crisis going on at the southern border you'd want to fix it but that's a great question for Dianne Feinstein\nWhich she says that you would like to even make it easier for people to come here illegally right\nI think so yeah\nWell and you feel as though this has been defined well in this in this political process in this election season\nI think we need to as as much as you can and much as your listeners can\nReally get out there and educate on what actually is happening at the border because it's not just four thousand people today it's two thousand people every single day and it's people we can't remove and then it's either going out\nYou know into communities and putting themselves at risk and they strap a gun to their head every day and go out there to keep our community say keep drugs off the street and it really is an effort\nAn educational effort to help everyone understand what is happening at the border and why we really do need Congress\nAnd three there were three border patrol soul to over the last five days so the the danger is real and last week for people listening for those who say well you know Katie ... to ... to me they're talking they don't have big hearts these people are horrible lives and we should just give them a shot how much of our tax dollars do you want to pay\nWho are worthy of help from the government\nHow can we possibly sustain our country if we have to pay for everybody to come here it's just not sustainable we will not be the beacon of hope and democracy because when it collapsed from within were running on a angle basis a deficit of seven hundred and fifty billion dollars\nHow much more are we willing to spend for people from other countries\nThat's the question that has to be asked just tell me do we all have to work an extra day for people in other countries when there's people in this country that need so much\nFor\nThe now Bryan we spent thirty three thousand dollars a year per unaccompanied alien child in that country they're Thirteen thousand unaccompanied children ha chest coffee right now\nThat money could be going towards Pell Grants that money can be going toward inner city schools that money can be going toward an advocate [laughter] so many things in our country and closing loopholes doesn't cost a diner taxpayer dollars\nIt's frustrating I Know for you especially when when people don't understand the issue and they make it personal and they're trying to go up in the polls when you're just trying to solve a problem Katie Waldman thanks so much\nThanks for having me on you got one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine that's a comprehensive look at the reality at the border we put politics aside your
