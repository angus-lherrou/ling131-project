I had been expecting the Republican Party to stand up to what the Democrats have been doing\nWhat they did years they did this and I don't think they finally did you do\nYears for years they have not no no no but that's what's causing me to go out and vote\nThey do their job they stand up All right I Will vote and everybody would vote\nFor the fascinating Ricardo and that's what's surprising even pollsters I've been listening to the rallies with President Trump I've never heard him like that ever they are so emotional and the numbers are moving and it may be saving the Senate\nBut the house might have an opposite effect do explain when we come back who tend to grow out west [noise] minimum\n\nIt's going to be the target of town for a minute we saw four point was\nTo stop we have to let people know that\nYou cannot politicized and weaponize things such as sexual assault in order to you know have political\nGain or political advantage to what the end with with Brett Kavanaugh getting on to the Supreme Court this this that and and I hope that people understand that\nA couple of things you know there's a there's a few things going on out there and one of which were going to be talking about more next week at the ramifications of the midterm elections it seems and now Republicans are over the top two Republicans on the one energize how did that happen [noise] what\nHappened very simply because you you know I wrote a piece about this call the the rule of law versus the mob rule and when you look at what is happening on the on Capitol Hill where senators of being in a cost that you you just had Sheila Jackson Lee one of her ... got arrested\nBecause that person was putting out the personal information of Senate Republicans we know what happens is ...\nReport that Planned Parenthood has come out and said that they're going after every single Senate Republican votes Ah yes for Brett Kavanaugh the ACLU has come out and take a stance against Brett Kavanaugh so now the ACLU was supposed to be about American civil liberties it's just so politicized organization\nSo what Republicans and I think you know Americans we're seeing\nIs that you have a mob awkward to see that is taking over the United states of America and it's being led by the Democrat Party and their accomplices and the liberal progressive ... that is repulsive\nIt is in a couple of things are happening right now you had a Senator Grassley I think it's been great do this using an impossible spot but he's been very strong\nAnd as it as has Lindsey Graham and you know corner has been good too I think Republicans need to shout back being shouted on I think see Jeff Flake just sitting there docile being yelled at you know he was kind of stunned but I think Republicans but from Cassidy\nTo attach to Grassley has started to uh Lindsey Graham are starting to push back a little bit when you talk about uh being energized listen to a dance scene or set on CBS this morning cut forty two\nI think it will be a I've never seen more since ... really has been elected I've never seen more unity among Republicans conservatives than right now so there is a segment of the Republican electorate that's either anti Trump for ambivalent about trauma\nAnd those folks for particularly suburban districts some suburban congressional districts in certain states there's always been in a sense of lack of enthusiasm among those Republicans I Would say couldn't distinguish between Donald Trump and the Republican Party the whole thing was cast so then the whole thing was frustrating to them and they don't want anything to do with it\nFor the first time in the last ten days I think the cabinet dynamic is transformed that brought all Republicans regardless of what they think the president\nAnd Lindsey Graham said the same thing I mean you didn't need convincing you don't see down Trump's perfect but you you're bored [laughter] well\nI Want to reiterate the exact same point this this is above and beyond Donald Trump this was about the rule of law in the United states Barrett has about due process\nIs about the future of our constitutional republic and when you're up against this that we are seeing I mean just look at what has happened since two thousand six said that\nThese antifa mobs the mobs that we see up there on Capitol Hill when you have a personal like Maxine Waters going out and telling folks to to go after people in restaurants or wherever they are people being told they have to leave restaurants being accosted in restaurants America people see this and they see the folks that are in charge of it\nThey saw how you know senator Spartacus Booker carried on and\nKamala Harris or you look at someone like Richard Blumenthal you know I'm here at Fort Sill Oklahoma with the first than for true the vision or a artillery reunion with men who served in Vietnam and yet we have a personal I Richard Blumenthal sitting up there talking about honor and integrity when he lied about sort of Vietnam\nThis is what is causing people to come out and say enough\nIs colonel is so interesting your book coming out now hold Texas hold the nation ... ... dead reverse to ah William Travis saying that's the message he wrote will you know we're gonna we're going to fight to the end against the Mexican army who barely out numbered them or we will died they died and were burned alive\nAnd that is the mantra but you talk about more politics you you worry that taxes could or Republicans could lose taxes and in ... lose the country\nWell what I see happening has is is a repeat of what happened in Nevada and\nArizona New Mexico Colorado you see the left coming in and they take over major urban population centers and successful red states and then they let them but what is so amazing is that people are coming to Texas which is uh\nThe constitutional conservative policies are taxes regulatory environment\nAnd you know they're thriving but yet they want to have the same failed economic policies an ideology\nThat they uh ran from from California from Eleanor from New York New Jersey and I think that if the the left can take a state like Texas effected competitive\nAnd they go on the thirty eight electoral votes there that does not bode well for our country and that is what you see the strategy of the progressive socialist left all across the United states of America is to go into a major urban centers in red states and places that are economics will set a successful\nLook at Florida Andrew Gillum and Florida look is Stacey Abrams running in Georgia both of them to be governors\nTheir beliefs their principles of values are the antithesis of what has made Georgia and Florida and then also you look at Texas successful so we have to sound that clarion call\nYou well yeah and by the way the first person could be against Ted Cruz although he has about four or five point lead a low over Mr O'Rourke who wisely the President Obama did not endorse that would have helped a cruise because he is not popular in Texas so whatsoever\nYeah and but about upon further review or rock shouldn't be popular he's talented he's got charisma but he's certainly doesn't reflect what I thought outside Austin, Texas represents a but we'll see Ted Cruz has got to step it up and maybe as a I look forward to your book it's going to be great uh and of course when does it come out\n[laughter] it comes on October sixteenth you can pre order right now I ...\nI go get it whole Texas hold the nation victory or debt who tend to colonel Allen West thanks so much\nAnd thank you for your endorsement of the book right\nAbsolutely great how when we come back we're going to be taking more of your calls when they take six for all eight seven six six nine\nOr the meeting started there on the Senate poor hundred strong Ninety three nine thirty it began eastern time at ten o'clock to begin to welcome and maybe the ranking member center Feinstein a terrible speaker who usually nods off in the middle of her dresses she'll come out and say some things against Brett Kavanaugh on how bad the investigation was which we both know are not true\nAnd we know that if she wanted a big investigation she would have done told us about it when she heard about it in July ... reiterated when she pushed it out in ... in August in states you wait until late September and she wants to believe she's a book titled how we really got her name at the last minute we had no idea\nAbout this when she had every idea about this totally disingenuous when we come back we'll give you a
