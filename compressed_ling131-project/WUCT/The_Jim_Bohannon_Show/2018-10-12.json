S. had been at loggerheads really for the last year or so we don't like the direction of that country their economy is crashing\nSo they want to keep their pride at the same time they want to rekindle relations if not economic relations have everything else\nSo do you think that they would benefit from a crashing of a Saturday American relationship\nI think they probably would feel they would benefit but I don't think that sense of benefit or could even possibly explain a the notion that they have cooked all this up I think that is really a A N the never never land a fear right\nNow I think we have to believe what they have provided\nA their intelligence services are among the best in the region um\nWe have a many contracts with them and despite the fact that relationship is not perfect with them right now we still have a a major airbase at ... uh they are still a NATO ally or and I think we have every reason to believe that they are coming forward here ah with curries\nSo I Want to you Bob Corker said yesterday cut Nineteen\nJust will change the relationship the warmth well dissipate uh it'll be far more businesslike and certainly there are going to be put at\nAt arm's length on many issues that we deal with them all and there's an arrogance that has developed with them over the last year and a half a an entitlement there's just something about the way they deal with us now that is very very different\n... and ... to ... explain the city because this crime prints did his American Tour trying to tell everybody that women are going to be able to drive going to try to give people additional freedom try to be more tolerant try to allow more demonstrations why go give us that toy dog and pony above pony show but yet you haven't changed\nThe crown prince is anxious for foreign direct investment foreign direct investment since she ah\nImprisoned his cousins and uncles that rich Carlton a year ago\nHas dropped off the cliff or it has a gone from a seven billion a two one billion dollars so he is anxious for foreign direct investment\nOr he is trying to put a happy face on it but bear in mind that at the same time he was allowing women to drive his imprisoning women who had a demonstrated or eggs agitated for that right he's making it clear that every privileged they receive in Saudi Arabia comes from him\nAnd not from any kind of sentimental rights and that's a very important distinction so yes she can he can point\nTo reforms which we welcome them and even ... complimented him on those reforms\nAnd laugh at the time\nFor a conference I Do not I think a lot of the treasury secretary should not go ... I think American business leaders should not go Jamie diamond should go Steven Schwartzman should not go\nWe know Richard branches already canceled a thanks so much invested Robert joined appreciated Ed Rollins next\nNews talk Ninety four point one they are the early riser so hardworking neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for the next\nYou know he talks about health care for all universal Medicare so does that something that should be resonating with Texans as he takes on Ted Cruz I mean he was within a few points and now he Ted Cruz beginning to pull away here's with Karl Rove said cut thirty seven\nPeople are waking up to the fact that Beto O'Rourke\nRobert Francis O'Rourke is a very liberal guy in favor of impeachment wants to government run health care are in favor of free college universal job thinks that the ... said that he can think of nothing more American he said then taken then decided to take a knee or at the plate of the national anthem\nThat's not a very to Texas guy the more you get to notice a liberal the less as a moderate or the the stronger it is but people have strong opinions about Bedouin strong opinions about that but at the end of the day it's gonna be a red victory\nYou ... do you think two calls right there\nAt the number of those car no one knows for the country better than Carl is certainly Texas a which is where he lives in where he basically built a reputation Ted Cruz is a very strong candidate people forget that he actually ran a very very strong campaign against Trump last time it probably the best campaign operation\nI'm going and he's got a lot of those people in there again any so\nAnd I think to a certain extent he's going to have one that won that fairly easily\nI think like you know what they say it reminds me a little Bush forty one he when he was a successful businessman made the transition into politics he lost a couple of races including a Senate race but they said while\nIn a democratic state of Texas this Bush guy did very well and he was tapped by the Nixon administration somebody they could join there and and begin to make his name known and they're seeing the same thing in beta O'Rourke even if he loses am I correct\n... they they see him as a future a national candidate a you know he's ... he's attractive the raised a lot of money on the Internet or you know Democrats are desperately looking for young candidates are they're very old very outdated party\nA and clearly their message a which is higher taxes more spending uh is is meant totally rejected by the Trump people and I think to a certain extent will be rejected again\nBut you know the trend uh and you've tried to push against the trend when you were with Reagan the trend is a go back and push back on the party in power and so that's what the uh Donald Trump is fighting against what did the cabinet or a ... confirmation do for this race\nI think I think it was such an outrageous attack a man of great the credibility in grade a reputation that I think we realize a ruthless and and the without discipline or the Democrats will be I mean there's there's no no end to what they will do\nAnd I like [noise] we now know that uh I think what we're going to be some people don't realize is is we have an extraordinary ground game by the congressional committee the national committee or some of the superPACs ordinary people on the ground and there's racists these competitive races so I think if you don't\nSee that you know national report that Democrats have done very little of that and I think a certain extent they're going to be a very very\nInteresting and Florida you're actually going to earn the wind or not and governor Rick Scott is chief strong\nWhich he always seems to be very organized guy and Ford and knows how to do hurricanes that would boost to Senate prospects\nAnd then somehow Rhonda Santas has the congressmen who wants to be a governor show himself competent in this situation how would you invite advised the Republican are running against a Gillum\nWho has got a lot of support and even though he seems to be a failed mayor in Tallahassee how ... how would you tell them\nI think the key thing here is don't don't over in don't miss represent dealings record just talk about what he's done what he stands for because he is a socialist uh uh and I think the reality is that he he is not a credible candidate\nBut if you go try and go overboard you have a reaction to ... that I Would probably not ever on dissenters just sort of stumbled out of out of the box up\nMy he's got a good campaign manager there ... or ... comes campaign or a her as they used to work with me in the White House many years ago and she is as good as anybody in Florida a you know as I Am very confident the Scots gonna land Scott has a very strong candidate he does very well\nIn national crisis of this is a big crisis down ... this is going to clearly give him some advantages of ... very tired or has been underestimate in the past when people try to beat him but I think this is just on the east coast yeah very optimistic\nWhen does it do anything but I just put it this way when you have Rick Scott as governor who did so well for two years in won reelection and has that stay growing in in the black\nUh besides the red tide which he has no control over this would be a Republican to lose so far you have to say that this at this has not done enough to win I mean a ... any such a low profile right now I don't get it\nI don't get it either you know he was a guy who basically a up built a very strong reputation\nI mean you down they run a different kind of a campaign and I think there's some disappointment a you know there's still time to go a lot of the key thing there's it'll be as a very aggressive at the ballot program 'cause that's a very important enough they people are already voting down there and he just hasn't quite caught fire or I Hope he does ah I like him and I\nBut I think the key thing here is just exposing\nThem for what he is what he wants to do was to raise taxes or he's he's very socialistic and is\nThis approach a being mayor Tallahassee is not what it takes to be later the governors' states so I think that race will come back and again Scott Scott I think what is the ... but the Senate race and and if he dies himself to that that race or whatever\nThe a and Fitch got does when he'll be like the one of these Lindsey Graham senators he'll be part of almost every issue he's not going to be quiet and it's just not why he doesn't\nListen if he sees a very strong candidate a also has the resources to its attendant and media markets state it's it's not about organizations all about the your message on television and Scott is always run a very effective campaign dissent those real\nAnd round is with us now Lou Dobbs allowed me to talk to you I Know your own you know that many hurry to I'm very jealous of but I'll tell you I mean I I knew what they do and uh but I'm I'm fascinated by what's emerged and that is healthcare number one the through the entire process the controversy that Michael Cohen situation\nThe Russian situation now the cabinet situation when you ask the American people what matters most to healthcare it's a mess right now and now comes Bernie care Bernie comes out and writes a column where he says we have to get Medicare for all\nAnd guess what they're worth thirty nine states that rely on a ... will will go along with Bernie care but you know in ten years is going to cost thirty three billion dollars do you know they tried that in Vermont they had to bail out of it right away because it was on a unobtainable are unsustainable do you know that doctors will get less reimbursement\nSo you're talking about a lower quality care spread out through taxpayer dollars no longer have it from the offered from the job\nAnd the Donald Trump or to calm or somebody on the Trump staffer to come and say do you realize what everyone's proposing which leads Donald Trump to do something I think they'd Ed Rollins would support tell Democrats you can vote for him listen\nI think a lot of Democrats are going to vote Republican because I have many friends that the Democrats\nThe main base of the Democrats at this so far\nThat will end up being Venezuela\nGuy would end up being Venezuela I think a lot of Democrats are going to be voting Republican\nNaturally trying to say is I'm not telling you have to be a Democrat but I'm telling you Democrats have left you\nHave an ... that's not a centrist democratic part is not the party of Bill Clinton party basically of ... it it was far left as any I've seen in modern times uh let me this is that this is the Howard Dean the Bernie Sanders this is the ... the you know the party that basically lost to the government to do everything for you which means you're going to\nPay more taxes I mean the premise was very simple\nOr we're going to reduce the tax cuts a lemonade and spend more money that's what that's always been the formula and Trump basically is you know some of the in the dike and stop the excessive spending and basically a failed lowered everybody's taxes or\nWhich has got a booming economy and I think is the last two days\nOf this in the economy has benefited every American gr effectively\nAnd just go out and spell out would

... people realize that and plus unlimited spending no control whatsoever\nIt it just won't work or you know I think we have to fix the healthcare system I think we could halfway there last time\nWe need to come back in the fall and then next year and a ... a modification we need to do something about pre existing and what have you um but I think the reality is that what they're advocating have struck ... program\nAnd let me just tell you they tried it and Bernie Sanders Vermont\nThey had a payroll taxes up eleven point five percent income tax a nine point five percent and they still were
