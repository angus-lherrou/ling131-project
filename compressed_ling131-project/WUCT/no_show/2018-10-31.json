Williams wrong about intent my argument is that you're wrong about intent you're both right you're absolutely right the problem is they wrote it in plain English that's easy to understand\nAnd it doesn't say it in there they should have made it longer they should've included not of course not including foreign dignitaries and and uh and aliens and so on I mean I bet it would be spelled out it would be clear and not one person can make or maybe the problem is the way they wrote it\nWas too as something they assumed that we would know what the intent was when that is the job of the founding document the founding document is meant to say these are the laws these are the rights these are the restrictions on government this is the way it is and if that doesn't cover everything amen to me um the liberals are the ones who actually want to\nYou mean that's not what it is it's a chiseled in stone foundation and and I think that you and I understand that what was mad at me you've been on hold long time you heard that call he was mad at me because I used to not read the English I just read what it said\n[noise]\nWell I understand that I think too though that um when it was originally written it was ... in regard to the slaves I don't think the time they were thinking in terms of babies being born here\nHad nothing to do you have all you are a hundred percent right it was about slavery under President only\nAt some point someone came along 'cause that's what lawyers do and interpret it that way and had it backed up well the possibility exists to reinterpret because it was once and interpretation and self\nThat it was you know you're you're right the Supreme Court interpret it I think an Eighteen Ninety six Eighteen Ninety somewhere around there and they they are the ones that said yes this applies to anybody born here of yeah not not only do I want it to be reinterpreted I actually wanted\nTo be rewritten I wanted to be altered to say the original intent not including foreign dignitaries not including aliens and including fill in the blank make it clear because the founding documents should not be interpreted in my opinion you read and understood I I don't think that's asking much\nI don't think yeah I think you're absolutely correct yeah I think Trump that will bring that out by pushing that she's going to push it out there whether or not he was and I probably will is you know but at least he's bringing it up and I'm going with that but it only got one other quick\nPoint I think you'll like this is um I Do believe that William will be happy because we are if it does get reinterpreted we'll be right in line with France they did that nine to them did away with\nThe Internet I says well very well thank God we we didn't want the laws are afraid to be our laws I guess are I'd appreciate your bread appreciate your holding let's see there is a nice conversation now when you look back and he pretty much\nHas the same exact stances William without getting all mad and frustrated in many got right to the point here is that they intended here's what it said here's what we have to do and and also you know the reason why President Trump brought it up I think he's probably right and I said this earlier\nThis president has shown the ability the unmitigated ability ability to to start a conversation in this country I don't care if you're on the left and you hate him you're on the writing you love them or are you in between a you're not sure about\nHe can through one tweet or through one quick age or of a question in an interview\nSay something that will get us all talking and I think that's a good thing I don't know anybody on any side can say that's a bad thing that we're talking about the constitution and what the meaning of the fourteenth amendment is ... you know what I'm saying I think that's a good thing to\nBuy back to the phone lines is going to be a let's see your line one's going to be rained on what's going on McCain does rental high\nYeah are you doing limited dream of rounds up\nOn the fourteenth amendment I think ... is pretty plain and simple for me or not just solely for slaves I Believe if a woman coming here to the legal process as she happens to get pregnant along the way and then all of a sudden she gets in and then as the baby a few months later debate\nIt gets to stay that way I look at it\nWell I agree the baby gets to stay with us she came here legally or illegally I she should leave the problem is and the reason why we have the issue that we have these chain migration and visitation I'm I'm a I'm a travel as Ted Cruz talked about\nWe need to get rid of chain migration the babies born here I agree it's a citizen because that's what the fourteenth amendment says to me the mother isn't it the mother is a citizen and wherever the hell she came from your baby on day but I don't know I I agree with you the baby can stay she's got to get out and\nWe start making that the deal just what they're not going to be coming here and having babies and leave their babies here in ...\nYour baby back with you to Honduras even if the babies the United states citizen I don't think so I never leave my baby abide I take it back with me\nWell why even have the legal process law if people are able to just dump their kicks off whenever they want you\nKnow I I wouldn't know listen I again the fourteenth amendment says what it says\nThe dare I say it carries should I say it oh go ahead get is what it is ... ... ...\nTo hate is what it is ... so I it it is what it is and uh again I've I've made this clear several times over the years who said again for those of you were new to the show 'em and those of you are going to try once you leave on 'em\nYou come here illegally you drop a kid it that that is the the medical term right ... ... ...\nNo no\nDrop the kids slap land and then there it is it's an American citizen congratulations\nBrave drop the kid where go your ass back to\nMexico to me [laughter] that's the way it's got to be done to spell it out I'll spell it out as simply as I possibly can\nYou come here you have the baby the babies are citizen you've got three choices but the baby up for adoption leave the baby with with somebody who's in the United states it was a relative that easier legally or you take the child back with you the idea that you had the child here and it's now a citizen which again I agree there's fourteenth amendment says so\nBut then you get to stay and the dad just to come here from wherever and then the grandparents gets gum and then the deal and the DEA get to come and everybody else forget it dude no you had the baby here three choices take the baby back with you which is the humane thing to do as a parent leave\nThe baby here up for adoption you never see you again or give the baby to a relative of yours who's here in the United states legally that's very simple we should make that the law and you'll see a decrease\nIn people coming across the border and dropping the kid um and and getting all these benefits that will stop that magnet will go away but instead we're having an argument about the actual fourteenth amendment\nIt says what it says\nNow let's do something that makes sense for the safety and security and for the future of our country at the same time we work on possibly altering this amendment aids or editing nine for one pack editing nine four one Seventy four seven Joe ... dot com he wants to be the next governor of the great state of uh of Michigan\nHe's a Republican attorney general bill ... and he's a real shootout we come back we're going to hear from him right here on the Joe ... show\nThe ...

Michigan families and small businesses are eight billion dollars since\nIt was according to a fat and uh well uh we're going to say to that and getting ... and the big pay ...\nAbsolutely ... and again and you brought up automotive a simple question has to be asked of the residents of the voters of Michigan do you think these planes would be coming back had the corporate rate not been lowered these bonuses that went out to workers these increases in pay that went up to workers those are because of reports\nAnd do that if government gets out of the way business can flourish employees can flourish more people more jobs more stuff why is that lost on people bill\nBut you know it's part of this communication and I try to remind folks remember eight years ago Michigan was on the map where on life support emergency room\nWe've rebounded a but now we've got to build on the success of the last eight years and go forward and ... are there to draw a radically different or drastically different people I Want to take us for getting cut taxes and lower auto insurance rates and then you Gretchen ... she wants to raise taxes wants a government run health care which will mean ...\nA beer or cats or choose your doctor and how do you pay for a a government run government dominated and healthcare by your taxes so she's here she Jack up your taxes you won't be able to choose your doctor uh that's the road to the last decade part too\nWe can't it's too risky it's too risky and that's why we're going to go forward with Bill shoot\nI Lived there fulltime when John England was the governor and you're right he he won by very small margin but when he left there was a surplus\nIn the government taxes have been lowered he was talking about\nYou know having people drug tested before they get some sort of a social handout from the government he was actually looking out for our tax dollars are being taken out of our paychecks is that the kind of governor you want to be used while you're looking for a tax dollars make sure that we give a climate and the great state and the great lakes state of of more employment more business was coming back\nSo you got it and I'm running for governor because I Want to Michigan to grow and this is about us being competitive and winning a again and beating the other states in America that have more growth and more people than we do uh I don't want Michigan in the smaller shrinking a less significant state we\nOnce had Nineteen members of Congress will have Thirteen and after the next census phone that's evidence that to\nOther states are growing faster than we are at our expense and uh you know that's not sustainable I Want Michigan\nAnd the place where people are they called their home or not a vacation state of place they visit so we need to grow our economy grow a population a and a and improve our demographics so we go forward that's that's what it's all about\nAnd the reason people are living as ... it's not because it's not a beautiful state it's an amazing staple that people are leaving because the jobs left\nIn ... as the jumps come back and they had been slowly but surely doing so and as you get more conservative policies for people like you I Believe they will come back one last question ...\nM.

not everybody expected that\nUh and there were some sectors which definitely didn't look very bright business investment which was up ... percent\nOr in the second quarter was up in a modern very modest amount and the third quarter\nMaybe that's a reporting issue there's been some indication that a lot of things are being revised upwards kind of going forward but that is a critical issue and I think something that people are going to be watching very closely but when you take\nA slow down and some of our overseas trading partner markets\nAnd combine that with the fact that the fact that the Federal Reserve seems intent on jacking up interest rates pretty aggressively for the United states\nBy the way not happening anywhere else around the world uh I think there's just been a concern that they're going to basically take the top of the gross off our\nCountry and that and that we are going to experience more of a slowdown that we wouldn't be otherwise I I think there are a number of things going on that that should be mentioned one is\nIn the context of that everyone is concern that the trade skirmish which China in particular a is going to impact growth\nAre a lot of companies

economy\nThe republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass in this region well worth exploring we go immediately to a region that at this moment is on determine that is Florida the state of Florida has a column up\nAbout the contest between Ron descent to\nThe Republican Andrew Andrew Gillum the Democrats\nAsking from some very good questions about who is Andrew Gillum and is the state of Florida that voted happily for Donald Trump is about to move towards the Obama part\nOf the Democratic party or are they going for the Bernie Sanders even more radical than that part of the Democratic party Liz can we read Florida is it just going to be a different state every time there's an election\n[laughter] that's a really good question\nAndrew Gillum that democratic candidate was a surprise winter in the primaries that were held at her to win that was six weeks ago or so at no one really saw it coming he's the mayor of Tallahassee and\nA really there hadn't that not a whole lot was known about him he's an attractive African American a good speaker he is kind of a nearby la channel I guess you'd say\nOr or mold a but really no one knew a huge amount about this guy a\nAt including the fact that there was a corruption scandal swirling around Tallahassee where he is mayor ah for the last year or so and it's a pretty serious one and one of his former campaign workers\nA has been subpoenaed to it a a peer a ... he was um [noise] caught up Gillum to an FBI\nA investigation and where they ... it ... it's it's complicated but basically Gillum was has not been named in any indictment or subpoena but he's pretty\nDarn close to a lot of\nSeeming bad stuff that went on having to do naturally with real estate development and pay off a ... and honestly I I have no idea what the outcome of that will be as I say he is not personally been mentioned but it's very close to his office which I think is\nTainted his um his run but more importantly I think for the voters of Florida I I have to say I sort of shake my head about this Florida is a booming state one of the fastest growing states in the country one of the lowest unemployment rates\nAre under Governor Scott they've created an enormous number of jobs more than the country average uh and it just unimaginable course from New York as I Do need to tell you there is a steady exodus heading to Florida because of the low tax\nRates there and the fact that it's a great place to die forgive me but the low inheritance rate and all the rest of that stuff\nUh you know a lot of wealthy New Yorkers make it their business to move to Florida and when they retire so why Florida would want to change all that and that is what Gillum is promising higher taxes higher taxes particularly on corporations\nAre but higher taxes nonetheless this is a fellow who is funded heavily by George Soros and by organizations funded by George Soros he is not at all and the Obama lyrical old and in fact his way left of Obama honestly it is astounding to me that he has gotten so much traction in this race\nLook at the big picture of the Democratic party being astonishing successful in other races where the logic escapes me for example were were needed jobs because of the economy will affect the frustration here uh for me to figure this out with political\nThree point five percent following four point two percent of GDP that that is to post to to to dominate the conversation but it's not instead the conversation is turning obsessively about the conduct of Donald Trump\nIs that the Democratic message is that is that the closing arguments Donald Trump that's it\nWell yes and I I mean that's exactly right if you can come up with any kind of coherent democratic platform that they're running on I really love to hear it because I don't think it exists\nA instead what you have is anti Trump fever and and the problem is because the president is out there a\n... presiding over these enormous boisterous rallies day after day after day weighing in on all these contests in a sense that Democrats are responding to his presence in these races now I\nThink he's doing the right thing I think he does those turned out I think he's out there reminding voters that voted for him you know our work is not done\nOn on the home of the doubt and twenty ten do you recall those rallies in Philadelphia and Chicago he was always on the campaign trail with feverish attention talking about I remember particularly one don't give him the keys back big round the car into the ditch don't give him the kid back\nAnd he wouldn't ... he was extremely popular and the keys came back okay fine do so and so but I don't remember making Obama the centerpiece of twenty ten that was entirely about Nancy Pelosi and healthcare that was the ... done\nAnd in twenty four team or the Republicans held up quite firmly it was about jobs jobs jobs jobs I was the last midterm it wasn't about Obama although it was his administration the puzzle here is what does the Democrats promised to do\nIn the closing argument I guess all they promise to do is remove Donald Trump that's ... that's the campaign promise\nWell actually as you know times dire a wealthy Democrats backer has put a lot of money and is this race candidates who promise\nTo pursue impeachment the minute there in Congress I think there will be an effort to impeach the president a Maxine Waters is going to be head of the financial services committee and as a committee chair she will have the\nOpportunity to subpoena records and financial transactions all kinds of stuff\nFrom the president's so she has promised to move to a an impeachment uh hearing process as quickly as possible and I'm sure she'll do that I think that that this ... thing a little bit John is new and I agree\nThat Republicans should be out there talking about the growth of the economy would tax cuts that deregulation but the Republicans are doing it they are so cowed\nBy than demagogic with Democrats particularly about the tax cuts how it was all going to the corporations and to the wealthy people that they're really intimidated and they and and maybe some can't connect the dots I don't know but it's very disheartening that they have this weapon of the economy and they're not using it\nLose peek a columnist at Fox News columnist up the hill I'm John bachelor this segment of the

add to that about blue collar Larry because I Do small business reporting all the time and what I'm told repeatedly these last weeks is a small business confidence has never been higher and these were the first people\nTo endorse or embrace wrong a Donald Trump early in the campaign cycling I've puzzled about it what did they know that every all the smart guys don't know\nThey're still very confident about the economy and they're the ones who are the majority of hiring and all the jobs in America and the job creation\nAll I think you know going back to the campaign\nA candidate Trump argued again and again that the war against businesses over\nAnd the war against success is over and if you keep more of what you earn or risk or invest or you will be rewarded rather then penalize that's the beauty of the lower marginal tax rates and you know two years later that's what we are seeing\nAnd it's investment please I wanted to ask about this because I was just at a at a conference today and it's on the campus of recording now a lot of the good news that letter was talking about some of the skeptics Larry and I love your kind of response to this\nOr saying well gee you know there there were some really bad news in this latest report and the things that they say because that we could never get that for example that you know basically four percent growth now\nThat they were saying they were very disappointed with the business aspect numbers that and that shows that the corporate tax cut isn't working and so on and and I don't know if I handled that question very well but I Wonder you know what you'd say to that\nWell you know I think there were some glitches in that number I'm which will probably show up in a much stronger number in the fourth quarter in my show up in subsequent revisions um for example uh in the core kept ... core business investment spending\nShipments and cute three were up seven point seven percent and orders were up eight point five percent boat that ad rates\nNow that doesn't really jive with uh the slow down and business equipment which was only the euro coin four percent and I think that which will be straightened out a in a

all\nNo no I don't think so only in this quarter only in this quarter John I'm In the\nPrior quote if it was business investment in fact most of this expansion of the Trump expansion is coming from the business side uh although it was sloppy in this quarter and you're right a consumer spending was stronger but actually when you look at the statistics um\nHis investments fixed investment up six point four percent over the past year a consumer spending a three percent so this really is a business investment driven and that's how the U.S because we have not seen this since the mid to

includes the\nEfforts by the Kremlin to shed ISIS and the shed the cutthroat seven Syria while siding with the U.S side\nWe're also looking at the possibilities now of Russia working very closely with

fictional event the invasion of Asia by a foreign power interested in taking over the Korean Peninsula\nThat fictional event most recently that's all in the new Cold War tonight however even I turned ourselves to anticipating the mid term election in twenty Eighteen you will recall the allegations\nAgainst Donald Trump that he was a stooges the Kremlin and twenty sixteen well not only have those outlook a allegations continue but also there's a fresh round of allegations about how the Kremlin is seeking to undermine or wrecked democracy one more time in a congressional elections\nProfessor of

in Ukraine to Trump and Russia gate we're dealing with Russia gate right now 'cause it's a week before\nThe midterm election where the allegation goes\nThe Kremlin will once again be in the field to corrupt democracy we're dealing with the ironies of history how in the old Cold War they didn't tell them Margaret Thatcher that the Kremlin really had an agent in the election was their opposite number Michael Foot in labor party and in the new election\nOr they did they the Obama administration their intelligence apparatus their FBI their D. O. J. shouted to the rooftop Hillary Clinton shouted that Donald Trump isn't it as a Kremlin agent with no evidence that the world we live in the new Cold War is a ... and with farcical elements but\nThere is damage here and Steve I Want to begin with legitimacy what does the allegation a week before the midterm do for the legitimacy of the American government\nWe talk we talk about the potential and put a implications ramifications of this Russia the allegation that the Russians were manipulating the outcome of our elections in the case of Trump in two thousand sixty\nAnd as you say the media's pushing this now in regard to the house and congressional elections\nIn on November sick so we you and I talked about this a little bit and it is a subject in my book war with Russia as a question mark after it\nThe more I think about this I don't see this going away in the sense that as you said damage is being done we need that\nSince a process so here's what I asked myself and it's it's more question that an assertion but I think our folks listening ought to think about it or if you say\nAnd you say it for two and a half years\nEven though you can't produce any evidence that the Russians may have put Trump in the White House what have you done to the institution of the American presidency\nBecause it won't end with Trump because the idea that the Russians could do this the Clinton could do this and now they're saying\nCould choose our president\nPotentially de legitimize is the presidency as an institution it\nCast a shadow of wine or let's go to what's going to be the normal reaction the next Democratic president is going to get the same kind of stopped thrown at him or her that the Democrats have been throwing at Trump it isn't gonna end so what we have to ask ourselves is first we get a\nAlmost a deal agenda ... of our elections as a process\nBeginning with the presidential one and two sixteen now going into next Tuesday these questions have been raised so I have no doubt that if the Republicans hold the house a\nRemain a majority that segment of the Democratic party and its media will be saying that the Russians were behind this or that the Russian to you know tip the scales because they wanted to protect Trump so when we didn't have a shadow over the presidency and over\nThe next Congress that's fairly serious in my my mind John's and then that raises another question in my mind\nThese people take this seriously\nWhat are they saying about American voters\nAre on the American people now in democratic theory\nAnd you don't have to be a political philosophy notice the bedrock a representative democracy is that the agency\nLies with voters that voters will make a rational a functional democratic decision and you live by their decision you would agree with that I didn't look like you had a loss for yet to begin with that premise that go on from there to talk about\nInstitutions of representative government but you can't have\nInstitutions are representative government ah unless you had people to elect otherwise and some\nAuthoritarian systems have outwardly democratic parliament for example correct but they're essentially appointed and control\nIt's called managed democracy but ... democracy\nAnd representative democracy is the one we know how you need the voters but if the voters are said to be as they are in these Russia gate\nAllegations forever susceptible to a hundred thousand dollars worth of ads out of about forty billion ads bought or whatever it was a by some Russian wacko social media operation in St Petersburg what does that thing about the American people\nI mean we got to think this through and about uh people you and I John who've lived are higher life inundated by advertising on television that we don't believe for a man that I mean I Know that if I buy that beautiful car\nIt is not going to get me all those beautiful women that are leaning over the car I mean we had been raised to be\nIn tune of skeptical\nOf the things that come to our attention I I think that's fair to say I mean advertising agencies try to manipulate us but we know what's going on so to say\nThat the Russians are capable of manipulating American voters\nYou're saying something less about the Russians than about our own people but that is what these Russia gate allegations\nAre saying it is striking to me Steve remembering the election and just I was participating as a ... er and I was watching on Twitter I could tell when the Russians were on line because it was morning time in Petersburg so I Would often wish them very good morning in Russian and they would never respond because they didn't have a sense of ...\nFred it was kind of sharing that they were so keen on trying to influence us with awkward statements like Tennessee for Trump you know that kind of thing right\nFor like ... a very thank you very much picked a real hard state there for the Republicans imagine his day so I I it never occurred to me that it would be\nIt would be concocted to be a threat to democracy it seemed it seemed kind of sweet of them that they want to get it that they that they wanted to get in on the process because they don't have anything comparable\nHenry cars we talked this I won't go into it but historically whatever meddling or interference in the Russians did in to sixteen was

a bit from our subject so people know\nTwenty years ago Thirty years ago the major TV networks had major news gathering organizations on her own abroad that big bureaus in Moscow for example that's not the case anymore they don't generate their own new stories they take them from the New York times in the Washington Post so\nThe answer your question is is ... who I mean it's preposterous that this guy if this book and soul down in Florida\nDecided some were you for some reason to post a story about sure yet what are they care about Syria we don't know yet what matters is is he got out of the New York times Washington Post\nI I Want to look at it shapes on media and ... and when people walk up to me in the street and say stings a is putting gonna decide is putting gonna throw the house\nTo the Republicans the Democrats they aren't kidding and whether they get this they got up in the New York times the Washington Post or they got it from cable TV which gets their segments from

million viewers a\nBig country and a lot of people do believe this stuff\nNot I want to go to what is to be done with these allegations a one version of what has to be done is censorship how we see that underway right now in all directions because the social media sites are acting uh intermittently and\nAnd non transparently to censor or weed out Russian interference there are other things they're doing but we're ... I'm concentrating on Russia right now Russian interference\nHow that actually affects the election I Can't tell you but I Do know it sets up the possibility that whoever loses on Tuesday is to blame the Russians\nIt also sets up the possibility that there is never going to be a safe space for elections in America in perpetuity if this if this theme continues Steve are elections are always going to be vulnerable we can't shut the door fast enough\nAnd we have to find another way to go forward as the government which means distrust the mob trust the leadership that's where we're headed Steve trust the people who know best\n[laughter] that's what worries me among other things and that's a theme and a Bible\nAll that whereas this leading up to me and he got to get the language right\nRussia gate has been an elite project yes and one of the things I Do in the book is I trace it back to the CIA and Brennan maybe even before to sixteen and the story to the extent that it's known I put in the book I don't\nClaim to know at all because you never know everything that the intelligence services do that's why they're called intelligence services I guess but the problem here is that they set into motion these narratives about what's going on people leave them there\nFor one week away from the election and as you say are the losers are going to blame the Russians they will we've already had that in off year elections\nSo ... how do we get our elections back now one thing we do you and I talked about it I won't go into it a great line that I heard something the other day that reminded me of it [noise] we do the broadcast maybe more than one on the long history of American meddling in Russia and elections are Russian politics\nSure nine and six Nineteen Ninety six we throw money at it\nWhat we could start with Woodrow Wilson who sent troops to ride a bike ride Russian so I ...

find is a jumble had a show dot com you can follow me on Twitter had jumbo talks in the middle of all there is much in this world\nTo talk about which is a big extremely serious major we thought it would be only right on what he is as we speak live all Hallows eve eve\nTo uh take note of of Halloween in particular to a talk with Hollywood executive president and chief data strategist I'm headed media twentieth Century Fox Julie ... to talk about her book but ghost photographer thank you Julie\nWell how are you came up to tell you something where I come from which is rural Oklahoma I grew up with about thirty Jim both\nAh yeah well I grew up not far from you in southwestern Missouri and if you grow up with the named Jim ... have him in that part of the country are you going to use the jumbo real fast [laughter]\nOh yeah now you're now that that makes all the difference in the world I think in your community status if you're a gym\nOh absolutely oh yeah the elevated me I think it may be a point that bought me stood quotient there so you found your way to uh to Hollywood\nAnd the subtitles or the goals photographer Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of uh make believe published by a Adrian in live in I Believe\nYes which is a part of Simon Schuster\nYeah ah ... what exactly are we talking about here in terms of the ghost photographer\nYou know I I Will tell you that at the heart of the book\nActually a transformational a journey through grief\nUm because when I lost my mom to all timers um I was devastated and even five months after that I lost another very dear friend and tragically in a car accident and not long after I started seeing ghost and photograph\nWhere you know like you were we come from this guy to sound like you know hocus pocus and and I wasn't much of a believer I was actually you know I was actually the honest I didn't believe it all\nI I was very skeptical and that when it started to happen to me things really\nReally shifted they started to change 'em you know I think that when you are grieving\nUm that you know you're in a in a bit of a chaos and and your belief systems can shift and I think that's what happened and then not long after that is when I started getting some of the psychic powers or I could see them and hear them and feel them and even smell them\n... one of the smell was crazy I one of the one of those smell like\nWho has written a preview book the ghost photographer Julie ... our guest and uh she has to put some considerable fought\nAnd to imagination into this bill what's the uh the most uh I guess a scary or realistic doing you've ever seen in this particular brain\nWell at the really great question because there's certainly things that have been scary that I've seen and um and there's things that are scared that experience that actually didn't see\nI think that I had I had at one point I'm In the house they ... me back out I think after if you will the door kind of crash down into the other side for me\nUm had a lot of goes if you will that I'm kind of entered the house and we had\nHeaters turning on by themselves light of and computer rated it was it was absolutely and and um and so that was probably more frustrating but probably the scariest thing was the first coast that I I I took a picture of\nBecause it was the idea of it actually scared me and this is where the Hollywood comes into play where students that they hold her guys\nAnd so I'm thinking to myself oh no have I open the portal\nAnd am I going to get sucked into it and you know start screaming out for Carolyn or something I I I really was petrified\nUm I have I have seen um some some scary scary goes that look like they've been beat up a\nLot of girls but I had no idea [laughter] I didn't I think there will beat up before they cross our lives yeah and so they had a black\nGuy and like a a fat lip time so yeah there's been some scary things for sure\nBut I think that first one was more scary for me because I don't know what the heck it happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this now you had this return to the Halloween the movies with\nA Curtis jama Jamie Lee Curtis is are we going to see a return to those good old days of a of a scary this and the Freddie Krueger and that sort of thing\n[noise] you know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy's face symbol on um have figured out how to make 'em really commercial um horror films\nOn and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we view these things anymore but days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading in the future\nAs far as I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and um my answer was I Hope not because the way that we respond to storytelling at home is so muted it compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy at home you might smirk might have a smile a crush of faith but\nIf you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud\nYour body chemistry changes it actually it releases endorphins and say you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything's not just download and we sit and watch things by herself [noise]\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various a revenue streams of theaters for example uh get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do\nNot think so they do\nYeah does Hollywood kind of data but if you're showing a blockbuster movie in the theater pools in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and the and the can be a twelve dollars a candy bar or does the ... the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nNot that I'm aware of what you'd be where I Would I Do yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't\nYou know All right ah in terms of of the uh\nThe the creativity the that goes into a Hollywood production it seems to me the some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days go not into the TV shows or even though this was certainly feature movies seem so to me that sort of the highest levels of creativity at least\nPer per second of air time if you will go into music videos in commercials\nYou know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon the film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCosts for second on something like a star wars movie very expensive Avengers very expensive so it's really more I think about the effects than it is anything else\nDoes do those Hollywood been too much on affects how we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but boy we've got the great ... computer graphic or a a special effects here as long as you're on the grill light and magic on your side can you sell the public anything\nIt now you can't you you can't sell it felt like I think I got to tell you consumers are so smart they are so smart which is why you know I started digging into that the data side of things is to is to understand the customers more and there was a day when you could just make them moving in but he said\nI'm ... this was probably more like twenty two and baffling\nPart if they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that I listen I from what I've experienced and I and I had to put it you know to kind of start with that because I think ... I ... everything in it for every movie in Hollywood but no movie\nNo script ever starts out to be a bad movie\nYou know and all gone with the wind or Citizen Kane storage\nRight I mean and sometimes you might have a script they might ... not totally confident in but it turns out to be a phenomenal film [noise]\nUm so you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't know do we rely too much on special effects and some of our most successful movies and the ones that I've personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a single ... a special effect in any of those films um you know Slumdog Millionaire was a an Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect I you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I still think there's room\nYou know for those films that don't at least I Hope so because those are some of our our best stories\nGet in an article of faith among the good people in this country that anything that comes out of Hollywood is automatically the left wing of politics preaching to the rest of us you disagree\nOh God is it preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me um you know I I Do think that that is fully accurate I think that\nMaybe some of the stories that come to us might might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these rooms every day and you know I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up at his ... and a Republican household um but I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my heart is helpful at a sized stories had become because movies like hidden figures should never be considered politicized because there was nothing political about that movie\nWith a anyway a fascinating tale and we thought that on Halloween or virtually Halloween that we should hear from Julie ...\nWho is a president GPA this rather just ahead of media twentieth Century Fox to talk about the ghost photographer Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it is published by age ... and it's a it's a fascinating tale we'll be back with more in just a moment to\nJoin the boundaries for three weeks of working it's November twenty six thirty in trial all the services that we have to offer the private meetings and one of our conference room make copies or just weren't from our co working space mentors\nAvailable throughout the week for you to learn more about the values of the foundry and the passion we have for new leadership in Africa I'm really be sure to find something new Disney and time limits on me and this is where the upper humbling talk and cares\nEver consider what you were ... water by far down now we're there and I do ride back up again\nMaybe you'd saying side I Need some work done maybe I've lived here and then in fact that I Know around\nOr is this your garage door dude I haven't worked in years\nRight on the road to you Roger ... told the ugly or busted didn't open the door to higher property value and bitter curb appeal with the junior when the original overhead door we've been the leader\nRacial upheaval only about on certain three year fixed rate loan Scott across information in conditions people having liquor licensing office he takes animal is number three thirty visual conditions exclusion may apply\nThat can't believe that we're playing foreign for basketball with the barbershop quartet\nAs the ball a bad\nUh\nNo I Can't believe how easy it will save hundreds of dollars in my car insurance with Geico\nShoes you know ... percent and more car insurance\nDay we're another step closer to Halloween and at some other group does mine the deals are filled good downright spooky finds rightfully low prices on high quality certified ... cars trucks and asked me you know payments\nStill twenty Nineteen with approved credit drive into the night in any sign all to nine or a Honda Civic checkered shading Shaun White Silverado en route to get away from his knees in and\nDo you mean like the award winning Ford and every time we own vehicle on the line has gone through our one hundred flashpoint inspection hunting summit certified free own certification\nWhose tenure unlimited miles power train warranty seed dealer pretty pale scare some savings would that great selection of life on science that shows all under ten thousand dollars or whatever is on Miller avenue and cross now across from regions ...

I don't think the American people honestly told that what they were engaged in which nationalizing some a significant industry\nWent ahead as if they use the healthcare system in the United states is similar to the legal system in the United states has lots of problems our legal system has lots of problems ... and the healthcare system has lots of problems but when we compare it to other parts of the world\nWe thank God we have it because it's the best in the world right well that that the\nBasically the system was demonized\nUm man that was that they were just a lot of ... going on in order to achieve is again the engine advised demeans the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy of the Democrat Party we look and we you know the terms looming we have a series of candidates who are posing as something other than what they\nAre ... years we've been hearing a number of things about the people that are most notably a Christians similar from Arizona Claire McCaskill of Missouri are quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at least made public in which they indicate there are a lot more to the left than the than the\nShall we say they portray themselves to be we have a number of people who would like to speak with James Harrison and they lead off with David and Creston, Iowa hello

party to solve a A N barreled a goal\nAnd that was the first day and then the other one\nIs that I think the the ... entire Congress is going to have to stick to fill their ... and\nI'm Sorry you're kinda skipping in and out what was that last comment David and then I Want our guest to comment\nI I think we need to hold a statement for the uh the Congress up there to put this on their forehead so that each of them can read it and says are a little respect would ah tore each other if you'd want respect you have to give ...\nWell they're certainly that's a that's a would be nice to add I think at this particular time your thoughts James ... about that\nYeah and I think that sums up what David is trying to say and that's something I I think all Americans would like to see 'em a little more decorum and dignity among each other\nBut basically you know with that the kind of commentary this collateral damage commentary Hillary Clinton saying you don't have to be civil um\nAnd the\nThe basic um atmosphere I brought up the Kavanaugh hearings to see these mobs of people and they are ... percent that caused you know the president to come up with the slogan jobs now biopsy\nWhich I thought one billion by the way but it was ... you know he is like really slow down here\nBut we take 'em if the Democratic leaders have not called out they haven't called out and he thought yeah always willing to go after the president's\nLatest rhetorical excess by the president is is a test them out to a stabbing somebody in the heart but when people literally go out and vandalize and then ... perform arson and and the like\nOh they they they they're not say anything and of course they don't because they're they're scared to death of the Democratic right there is good at what happened to uh

late to go there well\nIf your if your morals and ethics of lead you to break the law I Would would thoroughly concur lesson admitted to go here ah your response James\n... well you know brings up this idea when he talked about his movie analogies and that is we were talking about a political party that has made it their position not to accept the results of an election\nUm they've they've tried every way they can with their allies in the media to essentially not only undermine the president to remove him from office using governmental agency so and it's all failed\nAnd yes there there are any mental state\nOf kind of the uh the dealing with these when someone deals with that\nThere is still in well we're we're we're coming up with a break that doesn't move and do we will take that

good point because we had a previous caller who said the very same thing I don't know if you remember this story and I I Would suspect it's still going on in Los Angeles\nThe way that they were they set up entire homes in LA for that express purpose to bring people in illegally to have their children here and it was an industry\nYeah yeah\nYeah and here's the thing that where I go against cherries rationale it's first of all there is no clear jury could is on the fourteenth amendment with regards to given citizenship to illegals here because of that we have to go back to eat regional intention\nAnd the writers of the fourteenth amendment were very clear and specific this will not apply to everyone this will not apply to people more than any use the example of the Indians are being born in America but it doesn't cause for automatic citizenship the strategy I see that Trump is going to do is\nHe's going to sign the executive order because he knows it's going to be challenged sits a chess game right it's going to go to the ... where are the reason why is because he knows Congress is too scared to act on it and if we named the constitution\nIs gonna be a long trial this is one of those states that we need to take it into by before it goes out of control\nMen will I I couldn't agree more and I think you made it a very good point and I agree with the strategy thanks a lot for the phone call from Sacramento, California I think that this is all part of the plan the executive the signing of the executive order is designed so that it does it get to the Supreme Court and he he believes he has a much\nBetter chance uh at the at that level than to try to get it rammed through Congress who I mean who knows what's gonna happen in the mid term first of all so maybe that's the timing issue here too before we go to the break I Do want to get in one quick sound clip here this is a vice president Mike Pence\nInterview today with political says yup the president of the United states is considering an executive\nFrankly birthright citizenship is a part of that and what I think the president's made clear is\nThat we're looking at action\nThat would reconsider birthright citizenship we all know what the fourteenth amendment says wheelchairs the language of the fourteenth amendment\nBut the Supreme Court of the United states has never ruled on whether or not the language of the fourteenth amendment subject to the jurisdiction there of applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally and I think the president's looking at executive action\nTo get it to the Supreme Court to rule on that very issue what was the intent in the Eighteen sixties when it was passed the fourteenth amendment and have we been following that or has it been applied in a different fashion or in a more liberal base\nThat's what the issue would be for the United States Supreme court this all happening by the way\nAs the caravan rules north from southern Mexico\nAnd

United States going to have eleven appearances in the next six days I've never seen anything like it from a president who's not asking you to vote for himself he's asking to vote for the people\nTo me the biggest mystery so far of this election is what's happening in the Senate seat or the race for the Senate seat in Arizona Jeff Flake seat\nMartha ... he's a fighter pilot a Republican conservative or trying to replace a conservative\nThat she's going against Kirsten Sinema who every day new revelations come out that shows her questionable character questionable life story and now you have a

things happen you know the person is doing a pretty good job on changing the subject to what he wants to change it to and getting the outrage all around I think that we're\nNow I don't know if he's really doing that I feel like we're watching these images of thousands of people trying to get in our country and heated and calculate that he's just talking about it and it's resonating with his voters\nShow when you hear some of the outrage is raging about the president would for example here's a Joe Biden due to this was his campaign screech cut twenty six\nAm sick in a jar\nOf terrorize our for all Americans for political beliefs phones this is not who we are\nA couple of things do we did uh we as a country ... bomber for Sandy Hook that Gabby Giffords got shot\nOr what happened in South Carolina church those were voices of hate hateful actions so you might not like do you might not like the way the President Obama handled it or the way we are blaming guns you might not do as President Trump handled it who tried to be diplomatic and then gets the backlash\nTo networks just teeing off on him saying he used to blame because he sets the tone of the country that black job a body builder what job who's on Instagram singing rubber duck you in the ocean whose family said he gradually got crazier and crazier how do you blame him for that\nTo me is is is you have to suspend logic\nI've heard psychiatrist say that because of the direction of the leadership and the rhetoric that's being spoken\nThat you have people that are already crazy and so then it just taking them off the deep end and they think it's normal I'm like why they are crazy you can't you can't kill someone unless you have something wrong up here\nHe just kept who could take someone's life\nWho would ever want to walk into a synagogue where you have innocent people eleven people and just gunned them down you don't do that this guy's crazy he's evil is evil that is what evil looks like an evil exist and this guy had with hated people just because they were Jewish\nBecause they were Jewish he hated on and now people want to blame the president the president's\nDaughter is Jewish his uh one of his advisors as daughter works there his son in law works there I'm at the White House he has these beautiful grandchildren they're Jewish I just don't the president has supported them he doesn't care about that is not anti Semitic it didn't stop this\nWe have a problem and we have a president who doesn't seem to believe he has a role to play and dealing with it I Would put specific responsibility on the president I think what he's done\n'em over the course of the last few years is helpful Mathis at the center and unapologetically incendiary president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nOkay so if you listen I'm not blaming anyone other than the person who pulled the trigger and who did that that crazy guy I'm In uh in everyone's angry at him for doing this\nBut if the if the left wants to blame the president are they okay with Maxine Waters saying what she said are they okay with Eric Holder saying what he says are they okay with Hillary Clinton saying there's going to be no civility unless her party wins but they're okay with that and they don't put blame on those individuals I don't but\nIf they're going to blame the president they've got to blame their party to\nSo ... and the New York times says these shows exactly why the president's so upset that President really upset because she cannot believe he's being blamed for this got thirty for\nReality is that his ... and six days now they can be very difficult for him a heading into next year for Republicans list control of the house and I think that he is feeling pressure quake it left\nFeeling pressure possibly but no more pressure than George Bush go when he lost the house no more pressure than Brock Obama when he lost everything to where was he was sure lacked\nYeah I mean I couldn't imagine being the president of the United states that the job that most people would never want because they all walk in with regular hair color and they all walk out with the gray right it's a and I would not just president he will walk out that she might know my point is um is that it is a very stressful job and you can't\nYou can't Google yourself without seeing everything just all these negative articles I don't know how they survive I don't know how to eat or to president of the United states if you Google our names uplifting they hate us just don't do it but my point is like the the the left hates him so much they attack they attack they attack\nPresident the United states when he says it's fake news how frustrating would it be when you say one thing and you know your heart and you know your mind and you know what the meaning of your words are and then they construe it to mean something\nElse though in the ... or you would handle it you would say so I could I'm very upset about the way I've been portrayed on a different areas of the media here's what I think\nBut you're not Donald Trump it I'm not Donald Trump ... he comes out and says you're the prop I'm not the problem you are the problem so then these people say well we're not as though you're not a not only is he not contrite\nNow that he's attacking me and then they doubled down I watched a panel last night I stayed late to do more to talk about Andrew Jackson America neurons out in paperback products they literally\nAnd I'm watching and it's just silly put on CNN the five people in the penalty all hated Donald Trump ... almost as much as the host so what how does that seem very\nThing that people love about him other people hate about him and that's the fact that he's a fighter and the country I think a lot of people in middle America and voted for him that the Trump supporters they like the fact that he fights back they might say I don't like that he says one thing or this thing called the girl death\nBut ultimately they like how he fights back because they're tired of watching them air the what's the question of America and I think he stands for something bigger and he's a fighter and that very quality a lot of other people don't like because they don't think he's a presidential but our country got here because I think his base feels like\nThe country was getting weaker and weaker and more global and more global and he fights for the country\nAs hard of a larger national offered to rejoice divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil to\nStop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nSomething wrong with that so they could the false attacks ridiculous you it kills me is not a

crazy argument it's a legitimate one honest people can differ and you don't have to hate the person or labeled a person who we come back Karl Rove on this debate and of course keep your calls coming\n\n[noise] news talk Ninety four point one they are the early riser so hardworking neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for the next\nWell ... ... ...\nYeah yeah he could do a lot of good and you can do not so much good it really depends on how he handles himself in what he says look the president was at a high point last week and then the uh the IDs\nBeing sent to Democrats and then there was this anti Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh\nOr hurt the president's ratings because of the way that he responded he said the right things at times\nAnd he said some things that rubbed people raw and I can see it and the data it's affecting people around the country this is an election is going to be over so very close and because of that if the president says something good and handles himself well and and it keeps it puts his numbers back up to where they were like Tuesday or Wednesday\nOf last week that Republicans are going to do better than if they stay where they are because there has been a slight diminution other presidents standing largely because of his responses to these events\n... help was his response to the other day right so who who use response is one thing I Do a scripted and they were fine but when he started when he looked at the television and I know George Bush really never did when he moved to cable news and so I was being ripped and blamed he went back at him\nDo you think he was being um do you think it was he was being fairly treated windows IDs or whatever you want to call them went to his enemies by that deranged character living in a band in Florida do you think he was being a a adequately characterized oh\nNo no I think it was being unfairly characterized the question is how to respond to respond by taking it to buy for going after your critics or do you rise above it\nAnd cause people to say well you know what I hear what I hear what Schumer and Pelosi you're saying but I see what the president is saying when he goes on television and I I hear what the critics on CNN and MSNBC and other places have their say blaming him about it but he seems to be focused on\nConsoling the victims and setting the right tone so it's the contrast that people arrive in their own minds rather than necessarily\nHe what he has to say look people you know he's the president when he punches down at the media he's he is the most powerful person in the world\nAnd he is picking an argument with ... with somebody who has a lousy ratings on cable TV so I Would much rather have him be the person that we saw at that rally in Wisconsin who spoke so eloquently about what was going on the the president who called for unity\nThe man who raised the tone I'd rather see that and I think the persuadable voters voters who are up for grabs this very close election they want to see that person rather than\nThe guy who's taken a slug have somebody who's mouthed off on some panel on on a cable TV show but the\nList of targets was right on a Trump's relentless rhetorical playbook bombers enemies where his enemies he has said so again and again and again\nEveryone should stop pretending that Trump doesn't really know what he's doing\nUm when he when he says these things he knows exactly what he's trying to encourage\nDonald Trump failed the country he doesn't just failed Democrats he felt Democrats and Republicans and all of them it all Americans in between he\nHe you in any way acknowledge what role his rhetoric may have played in cultivating the current political\nThat ... on reporter the president has created a culture of comfort\nFor violent rhetoric and an actual violence\nAnd this has been a boy got a point I've been watching some of it there is for people for all have the same view he's horrific responsible and he basically everything's a pulled the trigger\nThe let's let's let's look at a thought experiment here\nLet's turn the clock back a year and let's substitute the word Bernie Sanders or the Democratic resistance or Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer for ... and have those people say the same things about the Bernie Sanders supporter who shows up at the Republican congressional baseball practice with weapons and bullets\nAnd enlist in his pocket and kill and almost killed ... and if it were not for the accidental presence of to a Capitol Hill police who who accompanied squeezed\nAs a member of the leadership we could have seen a dozen or more Republican legislators assassinated\nAnd and and could any one of those people did any one of those people say Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi or the resistance or Tom star in with their hateful language about the president and then you know it Clapper calling wasn't Clapper or somebody else renting gives them a treason\nBrennan what what did anybody step forward out of that group\nAnd say this is this is inciting people to violets and they're responsible for further Bernie Sanders supporters showing up and trying to kill Republican members of Congress plays for God's sake put our country first and stop this\nI agree I I was done by the president got his man to be better if he had to do that if someone like you actually do that exactly\nEspecially somebody that's not all lean on him but somebody who's calling balls and strikes like you to be honest so Carl a couple of things that he's going to go over some major regions it surprised me first off why is me love struggling in a in Utah\nWell first of all this is the most democratic district in the state it includes the city of Salt Lake people think of Utah as a conservative state and it is but the city of Salt Lake\nI grew up part of my childhood and Utah that if you're a liberal you live in the city of Salt Lake or and so it's it is the most democratic district and second she's never been effective fundraiser so she's got a she's got a ... a former mayor or who's capable of raising money\nThen they got him she struggled there\nYeah and she's she is she struggled but it's it is the most democratic district and in the year like this hum and remember we'd have a weird thing going on in the Mormons the Mormons are conservative by nature but they also have a certain set of\nStandards are at the core of if you will that they expect of their elected officials that is why Donald Trump brand so poorly and\nIn Nevada actually in Utah and and a third party candidate got a significant slug votes from nominal Republicans who said I Can't support the president's personal behavior so\nI think she's okay at the end in part because it's it's it's Mitt Romney time in in Utah but she is she's in a bigger\nRace people expected yet\nRight now the last polls hazard down by six defined stunning we'll see where that goes by the way that has a lot to do with why flaking Ann Romney for the most part can't stomach him\nA and even though Romney says yo suck it up and go along when he can we now have new Marsha Blackburn seems to have solidified elite over ... over\nI I don't think so uh Bredesen is running a very smart campaign they're attacking Marcia unfairly\nHere at the end of but um you know she's she's she's made some you know she is irritated some of her fellow Republicans over the years in the state I don't think it's over I think she wins I'm involved with the superPAC that spending a vast sums of money to help get her and Senate leadership\nIndia to execute they've got to continue to execute a there's the question is going to be our suburban Republicans in the Nashville area\nGoing to are going to turn out to vote and vote for Brett us\nOr are they going to stay with their party and vote Republican and then our\nShe's got a a an awkward relationship over in the western part of the stay with the Shelby County Republicans and are they going to turn out the numbers that need to I think at the end of the day this state is the president's approval rating is pretty darn good at the state and I think at the end of the day they pick her but I don't think it's over\nSome of the ... has her up fifty one forty six we'll see how that goes now the biggest mystery to me what's going on in Arizona\nHow could more than ... judging by what is the fighter pilot in the first female and the me too movement a Republican looking to replace Jeff Flake aggressively campaigning why she wrestling against Christian sooner in the last poll she's trailing by two or three points\nAnd yet she is come on strong and send them has been exposed to somebody pretending to be a moderate who isn't who's like stories not holding up\nYou know well cinema has worked the last five or six years to convince the Phoenix business community that she is a business moderate and uh she's joined the blue Dog Democrats she said the right things she hasn't voted right that much\nBut she said the right things and she has cultivated that crowd and she comes from Phoenix\nWhich is where most of the voters are [noise]\nAnd ah and mix Sally us from Tucson which is the second largest media markets but but pretty pretty small I Will say this again looking at the early vote as of last night four hundred and sixty four thousand\nFour hundred and Ninety One Republicans had voted early versus three hundred and fifty six thousand Democrats and two hundred and fifty two thousand independent other party voters that's actually as a Sunday night this represents a increase in the GOP share of the turnout versus twenty sixteen and a three point five seven points\nAt a democratic decline of almost two points so it's a five and a half point swing towards Republicans in a state that they want it twenty sixteen by three and a half so that's good news for mix alley and do see as long as that includes ... Republicans who are coming out to vote for mix alley and not to just cast a protest\nLast we we only have a few minutes about a minute but I Want you to hear Hillary Clinton got twenty five\nHere that that child quite know how long I adore what do you think of anything that can get to that kind\nA lot colder air ... now I Know they all look alike\n[noise] ... first or would you is that okay\nHour or online news talk Ninety four one dot com\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by their works relief and\nI'm Steve Case in President Trump heads to Florida Today just the start of a final days blitz before next week's mid term elections CBS was dancing Curtis is in Miami\nPresident in France is campaigning for Republicans here in Florida Today he's been trying to change the conversation to immigration and issue where Republicans think they have the edge\nOf a campaign stop for Democrats in Iowa former vice president Joe Biden\nThe single greatest fear between Fifteen and twenty five is being shot in school\n[noise]\nThat's a fact political corresponded ... says if Democrats want to seize control of Congress there's work to do\nThe only way that happens this year if Democrats need an exceed turn out that we've seen in previous mid term or non presidential elections and that is a high bar in several of these states\nIn a tweet President Trump defends his intention to sign in order to design do end birthright citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants she says it will be ended one way or the other White House press secretary Sarah Sanders\nShe's laid out a number of different pieces of legislation that Congress could have easily address these problems and helped fix our system and they failed to do that\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is among the critics of the president's plan ten Chinese intelligence officers are accused of hacking their way into American jet engine companies trying to get turbo fan technology\nThan a statement a U.S attorney accused China of trying to steal the information for commercial gain saying that China I wouldn't use the information to build their own engines instead of buying American\nCBS Jeff ... says Thirteen companies in the U.S and other countries were targeted more funerals today for victims of last weekend's synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh city but it's beginning to get back to normal\nBusinesses are open along Forbes and Marie avenues people are returning to work navigating the police do tours in the media trucks and school has started\nAnd to that end local Taylor altered ice high school which is just blocks from the synagogue when the city's football championship last night beating rival Westinghouse Eighteen to aid to defend their title a moment of silence was held before the game which was supposed to have been played on Saturday\nThey'll re cops CBS News Pittsburgh\nThe payroll from a deep peace says companies had a two hundred twenty seven thousand jobs this monthly economists believe the Labor Department report on hiring later on this week will show one hundred Ninety thousand worker game Wall Street right down to die\nIt gives up one fifty this the CBS News\nTo experience relief or muscle cramps and your legs in feet used their works really fast acting foam get their works released today and the pain relief violate your local pharmacy or their works relief dot com\nTo experience relief or muscle cramps and ... used their works relief this fast acting boom has proven to prevent and relief footed leg cramps get their works really today and the pain relief via would Walmart CBS Rite Aid at Walgreens pharmacies or their works relief\nDot com zip recruiter the smartest way to hire zip recruiter post your job to over one hundred job boards with just one quick and then they're smart matching technology find the right candidates try for free at ... dot com slash CBS News\nIt's time to time to join the millions of people that need happy with his view video conferencing assumed gives you flawless video crystal clear audio and instant sharing\nAcross any mobile tablet or desktop device but the best thing about them which is worse to ditch the distraction and joined the movement and happy new video conferencing visit zoom die us to set up your free account today that little dot US view video conferencing\n\nThere's a new development in the legal case against him and accused of a mass shooting six months ago as we hear from CBS is Jim Crow Sula\nTravis Ryan king has been found mentally competent to stand trial the twenty nine year old man it's accused of using an assault style rifles to shoot up a waffle house restaurant to Nashville, Tennessee in April for people were killed police say he was nearly naked oldie wearing a green jacket\nWhen he allegedly opened fire outside the restaurant and then stormed at an odd arm to customers wrestled the gun away from Brian cake Jim ...

like you can't discuss that everyone is horrified all across channels\nThat are all over America instant harder right that this is some kind of um you know just like mean degrading take on how the ... as you should be handled me while I mean I I'm pretty sure I haven't seen pizzas on other networks about\nThese places in San Francisco where there have like you know places where people can calm and have babies just to have them in America I remember this whole story that was done about these sort of nice kind of apartment\nPlaces that people come and have babies\nMostly from Asia with that story that was dealing with it\nSo that they can be American citizens we all know that you know the anchor baby which is a controversial term meaning a child who you know whose mother came across the border specifically for the purpose to be born or we all understand the inclination that desire to have a child is born in America and have them be an American I think everybody understands that\nBut the problem with all of these immigration issues is that we've lost the process that's involved here and the thing is I feel for people who want to cross the border and have their baby born in the United states I understand that motivation\nThe problem is that these people have become ponds and they're very vulnerable and they're being used in that situation by Republicans and Democrats who refused to come together in order to build a process and pass legislation\nTo save and help these people in the process and nobody wants to confirm absolutely I forget the ocean and the caravan and I feel that as a country we have let them down and we've let American citizens down because we have no\nOrderly process for doing for taking care of these before we could open up the refugees are we have room\nTo

careful about how they're doing it and then when the he locks up all are all these other Saturday family members into the Ritz Carlton he seems to be a guy that is a little volatile let's say the least\nSo I asked the the secretary of that you just told me you're not going to break but are you going to reevaluate that relationship because of his recent actions\nAnd brown we we've got to see where the facts ultimately lead us ah we we we truly have a responsibility to America to the American people to ensure that we have a good relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nAh to general Hayden point to the people of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm are an important partner for the United states and World War working to make sure we have the right the facts right I've spoken to the king a couple of times I spoke with\nMBBS spoken with their foreign minister my direct counterpart out to bear on numerous occasions I think the Saudis share our view they understand that they've got to get these facts out in the time is not on their side and doing so\nSo the facts are ridiculous ... comes out they strangled him for the minute he walked in the question is what did he have the most thought about what did he had that Saudi Arabia besides being a critic did he have something specific\nThat the Saturday So they can take this type or risk and risk our relationship to kill them in this ham handed way\nAnd Britain tend to file and destroy his body maybe burn it with that said\nWell you know I mean to me that question is is it because they're on the ...\nYoung leader of being a reformist that this kind of behavior really stands out and is this you know Middle East justice that has been carried out\nMany times before without any other country really batting an eyelash I I think it is very interesting it feels like there must there was a very deep personal dig against ah the crown prince that may have led to his really divisive action against this individual if indeed he was aware of it\nUm there's this is an amazingly fascinating character or on the Saturday seeing here who has gone on her so much attention\nFor being so forward thinking when it comes to allowing women to drive and women to the theater but then when women rise up they're cracking down on them as hard as ever so it is um I think this is this is someone who in some ways um pull the wool over a lot of people's eyes in terms of of what kind of leader he will be um\nAnd I think that we need to be very very careful we cannot you know if if you want to be a a reform around the world stage and then you have to give up you know that this kind of brutal activity that is not indicative of the kind of leadership that we we can really obviously be on the side of\nThe ... forget how better relations was in Saudi Arabia and the administration of President Obama\nTo basically you couldn't have been worse and allowing a Mubarak to get out did when he sewage second if you're going to allow that to happen you know what I'm going to watch your back and that was a bad message said with the Arab Spring the Arab Spring was a disaster this president said\nUh was in a I'm not on buddy you hope for the best\nOf whoever you want to lead lead we're not fighting your wars and that this person is pretty being consistent on that would open a to stick it around and Syria who's leaving would be a disaster weaving right now in Afghanistan would be a disaster so he's instincts were to get out but the reality is he can be convinced are you seeing that Martha\nYeah I mean I think that when you look at the situation it's clear to everyone that not having a good relationship with Saudi Arabia is not an option\nAnd obviously the crown prince or if he was aware of what happened to democracy so he knows that but you know I think that that when you listen between the lines of what secretary of state Pompeo is saying I'm you know this the relationship is evolving and it needs to be clear that we cannot abide this kind of horrific murder\nAnd that that needs you know that kind of relationship needs change but as you point out the dynamic that we had under the prior president was a you know a very Iran leading dynamic and we have had to recalibrate back to\nThe alliances that we had in the middle east over over a century over hunting decades\nAnd um I think the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel is is also one that really\nCannot be jeopardy or it was going to do more to know but it's Martha needs to lighten up going to be all serious\nWe're trying to keep our nose to the

the county in central Florida you'd want to build more of a permit a dwelling of that size and what other things are they going to require but if if I were thinking of building something really affordable\nI Would also like you to think about a potential for resale in nine hundred square feet which is fifty percent larger than you're thinking about you can within an efficient building design you can build a three bedroom\nOr one or one and a half bat home\nAnd then you have something that when it's no longer where you want to live you have something that has a much\nLikely or market value to sell to someone else or as an ideal size for a rental property\nIt would go with the idea is that what you're saying\nI Would not go as small as six hundreds okay but if it were me I Would try to go a little larger even if it meant thirty thousand becomes a forty five thousand\nOr to the side of the ... you\nKnow it would not would not fit the definition of a tiny home but six hundred doesn't really eat their\nKids ... and it will be on wheels rate\nIt would not be on wheels are you thinking staying on wheels six hundred\n[noise] thinking about it yes\nSo that's a different kind of

rise\nSo I took three hundred dollars is what it's going to cost me\nYeah so I Would rather see you buy a a shredder that will allow you to do what we might call medium volume shredding I have one that I bought for I think it was like fifty nine dollars that I can cram like twenty sheets and the time and it make are awful racket\nAnd my kids have gotten too old now but I used to pay my kids to shreds for me and they thought they were making a fortune when I'd give him a dollar to to do it\nBut yeah so do you have any kids you can rent [laughter]\nIs it twenty five year old so I don't know if it's close to her house but ah\nYeah that's a that's not an aging pay a dollar or two [laughter] so I guess ... or ... you need to have some mindless TV on and just sit there and shred stuff one after another\nSounds like that's a shame because you said you had hundreds of pounds right [laughter] yeah at least two or three other adults yeah that's 'cause\nThat's hundreds of dollars you don't want to\nPay that kind of money to pay a commercial try to do it sometimes credit unions will have a ... day try to attract new members where they'll shreds stuff for free but I don't even know how you find out when credit unions are doing those free shredding days what a neat idea\nTim is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tim how you doing\nVery well our thanks\nWell great to have you here you have a question for me about home insurance is that right\nYes I Do I like to purchase a condo or town house and the Los Angeles county\nLike concern and fear is that showed an earthquake happened and the entire building complex isn't covered by earthquake insurance via the homeowner's association that I could possibly lose all my equity in my unit and even not have a place to live as well\nYou are correct so we didn't usual in a condominium that they would go with euphemistic early called self insured to rebuild the buildings for uh the aftermath of an earthquake\nOkay so when you're looking at a condo you can request from the seller ... they provide you all the documents on the condo association and they have to supply you that if you request it including you want to see what kinds of reserves the condo has\nAnd if it's not disclose do you want to know what kind of insurance coverage they have in in addition with that there's a crazy thing with condos have you on the condo before you know I have not\nSo Tim this is one that's like freaky weird okay\nLet's say there was forget earthquake let's say there was a um a fire or some event that caused significant damage to the building and it had to be rebuilt each condominium\nBesides in their bylaws what they're responsible for and the homeowners you still have to have like a condo owners policy and you got to make sure the condo owners policy you get matches up\nWith the where it takes over where the condo association policy leaves off\nSo some of them might not even reach sheet rock your condo and leave that to you after a destructive about\nOthers might include flooring others might not include new foreign it's not like a traditional homeowner's policy you're condo owners policy\nHas to be written so that it doesn't leave gaps between what the condo association coverage is and what your policy would cover now and the earthquake\nYou so you don't know yet if the condo association has earthquake insurance\nI knew that I I look to see if they do and as you mentioned it is extremely rare that had a choice they would have a earthquake policy for the entire complex very rare\nSo the ruins the risk to you can be intense\nVery substantial\nNow are you going to have a mortgage\nThey tend to pay it off with their little fate I've ears\nSo the the mortgage company will probably have a requirement that you have some level of insurance including for earthquakes to lower the risk to them in the event there was a catastrophic loss that you're building\nThat makes sense they are unaware that she will get insurance for inside the year that\nYeah that's what I was remembering too about the policies that match up with the with a condo association policy and you do need to have that ... depending on your mortgage lender they may or may not require that from you but you definitely want to have that\nI agree with that that I wouldn't be surprised that the mortgage company they would also require a joy to have mortgage or earthquake insurance tire complex\nBecause the lender is completely exposed if the condo is uninsured or under insured you're correct correct so\nI I think you you know my position on the ... the thing with earthquakes is that they are even in California they are they are rare but when one happens that can cause loss of life and massive destruction and loss of property\nAnd so I Would not want you going into a situation where you buy into a condo where you're left exposed for tremendous financial loss because the association does not cover by a ...

Am\nDave Ramsey your host thank you for joining us America was the lead you are here [noise] open phones that triple eight eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five Peter starts off this hour in games\nWell there how are you better than I deserve what's up\nGood thank you ... that I got a follow up on all the millionaire if that were calling in um but I just want to let you know I Am an avid listener and I can't believe I'm finding myself in the situation a little background a while back I was entering my apartment complex and found the gate shutting out my vehicle and cracked my windshield\nI tried to collect from the complex for the damages caused to my vehicle and from there was contacted by ... seven hundred and Seventy five dollars to pay for the gate that caused by my vehicle\nOn some back and forth conversation with ultimately refusing to pay them just because there's no indication of that is going to cause et cetera et cetera I thought everything was clear after I stopped sharing from them and this past week I got a call from a collection agency I'm just wondering if you have some advice for\nHer and attorney to hire an attorney\nSo seven hundred and Seventy five dollars worth of damage it yep okay what about do you think that small claims court could be an option yep\nBut I I'm ... and I think if you hire an attorney for a couple of hundred dollars and they write them a letter or you may shut this whole thing down I don't know that you don't have to go to small claims court\nOkay and so I'm I'm a conversation with the a collection agency cracked it has nothing to do with the apartment complex anymore\nSo yes it is still on that and they're the ones that hard to collections agency I Would say like I was something of my ...\nOkay so I Am in college as well just for some background as far as that goes\nOn that you think my my next step should be taught to attorney and be in contact with the um the apartment complex and no way could I could write a check the bit a collection agency\nBut if you think that the gate closed improperly and you weren't doing anything wrong and the stupid thing broke your car they need to fix your car and not charge you for the gate right right\nThat's what you're telling me and if that's the case um you know in a letter from an attorney may solved the whole thing uh but they're not scared of you obviously\nOr shall we need to get someone that gets their attention\nBecause basically you're getting run down by a a corporate ladder here uh this is probably a corporate owned or ... owned apartment complexes being quote unquote professionally managed\nAnd so you're not dealing with a mom and pop you just got stuck in the vortex here and the only way to jog that out is shock somebody and so yeah I mean that you're going to write a check 'em you might as well decide which one you want to write\nYou want to write a check for a gate that broke that wasn't your fault or do you want to write a check for justice me I like a good fight on my hillbilly so I'd rather just fight\nThat really would I mean I'll spend I'll spend a million dollars completely destroying something rather than spend ten dollars to keep from doing the wrong thing it just drives me bananas I Can't stand it Josh is with us in Chicago hey Josh how are you\nTo the question is from Brenda in Colorado a she comes to a brand new dot com it's just is dental insurance for my kid I was a gimmick or something I should keep paying don't or insurance is one of the most easy insurance is to figure out that they're charging you more than you are getting\nUm we've at dental insurance proposed to us as a a a\nEmployee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you would never spend that much on dentistry it just doesn't work out it's one of those things you should self insure through now we do have an advertiser that is with us\nThat is a a dental discount company and that is worth it\nBecause that helps you get discounts on me or dental repairs your dental work and so forth and um you know you can check them out as well you find them on our website one dental is what it's called one dental\nAnd a dream she'll tell me 'cause I was looking at him my brain wasn't were firing and I couldn't remember are great people to have gotten to know the\nOne dental but it's a discount program for dental services know about it is worth it and we do that but we've had dental insurance attempt advertiser many terms and we just simply don't let them Christine is with us from Hartford, Connecticut Hi Christine how are you\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh my goodness longtime listener and just so excited never call before\nSo um my husband and I are debt free including our house way to go well thank you for your teaching we followed them off [laughter] um and we are actually we're everyday millionaires I'm a teacher he's an electrician\nAnd um so we we've been investing in a way that you recommend and you don't get out of curiosity we finally decided to meet with any of the went online and found someone that you your site recommend\nThey may know more about over investing yeah okay yeah yeah and are\nSmart factor ... thank you okay um and we met with him and they were very uh ... you know had a lot of information for us\nAnd then you know the the structure is like a ... percent [laughter] I guess and\nSo why my husband and I didn't know is simply been investing in a way that you teach since we've been you know we both are blessed to have pensions\nWe have you know we're only in our fifties and we'd in theory they can retire and five years you don't have to but we we couldn't be comfortable um what what is it\nI'm a financial parking for a year at you know whatever I think it's like five thousand dollars a year ago I got five point five percent of what you're\nActually there looking they're proposing a ... a manager to count for you\nCorrect OK yeah a lot of the industry has gone to the managed to count approach and on and so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you come ... and I'm anytime you're investing and when I'm investing by the way my personal money's invested with one of our smart Russia approach okay [noise]\nUm and so the there's two ways to do investing in mutual funds upfront fees\nOr that as you do the investment they charge a fee and then there's very low almost no annual after that or they managed to count worry it's a percentage of the balance every year\nAnd now what are you getting for that while they're helping you select the funds and putting you in funds that are out performing the market overall um you know ... over a long period of time over average you know funds that outperform the U.S and the and of course you've got someone to meet with uncover anytime there's a question about anything\nI'm a if there's a change in the market and you're worried about it or up or down um anything along those lines and there's tons of studies that say that\nYou will come out ahead doing those two things one is getting good advice and picking the proper funds and to a you know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out you're probably not already not doing that one when\nWe look at I mean I can do every day\nYou know kind of ... you've got that Dali and you're not going to jump off the roller coaster and get hurt you know so that that part of stuff so you know the\nJust asked them to show you okay why are you worse what is your charging and you know because you're charging me a fee argue worth that are in in most cases you'll find it is\nIt that way then you're going to make more than the cost of the fee\nIn extra returns and certainly in services in terms of um you know education that's available to you and\nUm you know there's a thousand mutual funds to go through I don't keep up with eight thousand mutual funds I have a day job you know and so a a life you know I don't want to do that but those guys that's all they do all day long this comb through those funds\nIt's their whole world they eat live and breathe that stuff and it's I also don't work on my own car\nI could probably fix my car cheaper than the mechanic fixes it but it would take me longer\nOr there'd be several trial and error is along the way I might break something in the process and so it's worth it to me to get somebody to hook the computer up to the car that actually has the computer hooks up to the guards instead of me being a redneck laying on trying to figure this out\nAnd it's kind of like you know investments I don't see eye why those either um I don't even do my own taxes are and I'm pretty good at this stuff it's what I Do I'm a money guy and got a natural event for math and all that kind of stuff but\nI don't why when it gets into the the the you know the dirty details so to speak so that's why I think you're going to find the investment is worth that the managers account is worth it but I it's fair to ask them to show you\nOkay you the typical guy does this or you've been doing this over here but if you had been with us during that same period of time here's what we would have had you and here's what the ... and it you know what am I knew one and a half percent more what it costs to half a percent street an editor for one that kind of a thing um it's a fair question to say hey prove your worth\nAnd uh I don't think any smart Mr pro that we have would um\nTell you that that they can't do that\nIs that they can then then just asking to show you a good question Alex is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Alex welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAre you doing today better than I deserve so what's up a good question um maybe a better question for Gary Coleman but about my career\nUh I'm currently in by but that too and I'm a welder I worked at a town and I'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year mhm and um I've got opportunity to go work at home but the pay is about a\nOf what am I working out of town and I miss a curious if you thought it was crazy that hey I'd be all by that I'm I'm not married yet I'm getting married next month\nSo you're making a hundred and forty and you'd make like fifty yeah OK at home I'm no where are you are where are you working out of town\nA member going on now but I'm I'm actually been all over the world was on um [noise] you know my own they own market right now I'm On\n... anything other than a flower mhm mhm okay well\nI think the answer for me would always be see none of the above\n... ... I liked the idea of coming off the road I don't like the idea of a two thirds pay cut so I got to figure out now and I don't either how can I come off the road and make more money what am I gotta do to make more money off the road or can I Do some kind of a mix and say I'm going to be gone two weekends a month and a and go\nJust ... out on the road that way and pick up some serious change\nAs until but is there is there a pass a career paths at home or whether it's owning your own shop or a you know [noise] I don't know run running a different kind of a ... a different way of doing this rather than just saying a J. O. V. at home\nVersus a road jobs is there another way to do this and that's that's what I'm going to be ... the rocks I'm going to be turning over looking forward to how to do that and um you know where do I want to be one I'm forty and will be on the road [noise] you don't want to be on the road already you told me that getting married don't blame you I think it's gonna it'll be home with a new wife

I don't think uh\nI have confidence an officer coordinator they they obviously have a game plan there's a reason why they get paid hundreds of thousands of you know ... million dollars a year\nUm you know I'm just a spectator but it is a little it's been a little bit discouraging but I'm happy to be in that position we're in ... um I I wouldn't I wouldn't take it any other way to be quite honest but it is a little bit um scary to be quite\nOn hot I listen I enjoy the sport in Kevin ...

where we are and thank God I was not a\nBig coaches best friend and his first two or three years so now what is wrong but I'm interested in this year in your perception where to sit in for Kentucky what's their record when the seasons over and where they rank and what kind of a bold they used to um get\nAnd what I think uh if I if I had to say right now I think their record at the end of the season will be a either a loving and one or ten and two so I I still haven't made up my mind about this weekend but I but I think\nTen and two is very doable which is which will get you in a New Year's day bowl\nThat gets us into one of the six post\nI think I Would think so yes or putting along anyway\nWell I appreciate the way she let me come on and and are handled one I Can't get the words out like are warm and\nHave a great audio or I Want to say this to you and and anyone out there uh\nYou're welcome here uh you sound great to me I'm just glad that ah\nThat you're doing well and and and have the ability to call in and communicate with us\nWell I appreciate it and I love the show and watch it all the time\nBut I think Larry much can't wait to see your family this weekend\nOkay Bye bye thank\nYou gotta thanks so much a great to hear from you but let's take a short break here or more to come eight five five to four to seven to eight five we'll talk to south Waldor about or some analytics here in just a moment we're coming right back\nMichigan when is out there in I think the question to me is is it conceivable that Michigan could actually lose to Penn State and somehow still in the playoffs and I\nActually think this is the best sort of path if you're looking for it to last team to get in the playoff Michigan can lose this weekend when our when the big tend to last Big Ten champion with a tough schedule\nNow they're likely talked about Alabama a minute ago they would need help in that situation there's no question about it but all you would really need you can assume Alabama wins out assume Clinton wins out soon Notre Dame wins out\nAnd then you're talking about well the big twelve have a two last champ end of the pact will have to last chance if they do I think Michigan is would be top among the two last champion seems like it's a long shot\nI you know there's a lot we are talking about needing to happen but I Do think that's a scenario that could play out that maybe the most likely way you could get it to last team in the playoff\nLet's talk a little bit about this on on predictable ah games unpredictable insensitive means so much Georgia at Kentucky this weekend or give us the scenario there\nSure I mean I'm Kentucky fans asked me each and every week you know what if we win the next game away a real contender what if we win the next game here's the bad news if your Kentucky\nYou read Georgia this weekend which is tough enough as it is and we only give you a two percent chance to make the playoffs\nWhy will be the FBI doesn't think that Kentucky is that great and therefore if the if the game against tendency is not a one hundred percent slam dunk and then you're probably going to have to face Alabama and if you thought playing Georgia was tough\nPlaying Alabama is even more difficult now look anything can happen and that's why we like college football I think it could be an interesting game this weekend between Kentucky in Georgia but\nIf they're going to be a long long road if you're a Kentucky fan and you think uh you know your real playoff contenders\nThis question came up last night on the show about Notre Dame ... we would assume the games in with a win but what about a loss\nI think that they're still in a situation where you're probably in out of Lebanon one but it's not a guarantee they can take a last weekend and it would hurt their chances if that could end up all Lebanon one I think they're going to be fine as long as you have you don't have for one or zero laws\nConference champions and then the one exception to that might be an eleven and want Alabama that also could keep them out but the odds of that happening are not all that great it definitely could\nBut I Do think that more likely than not and eleven and won the numbers bear this out in Lebanon one Notre Dame team is more likely than not in the playoff\nOr did it on Alabama find how Alabama\nOvercomes not being a divisional or conference champions again well\nI Know we ... you know you look at their their weakness to their strength of schedule of course but that was their weakness a year ago and to me when you talk about teen quality you know we put essentially we didn't use the FBI as a proxy for\nAh for the test if there's a team in the nation that we're under rating it Alabama because when you look at what they've done against teams that the only playing with you know playing two and a half three quarters at full speed we haven't seen them need to do a full game and maybe we'll get that this weekend but\nYou know the FBI is built that it can handle some garbage time situations where you take out your starter you're not trying to score at the same rate that you might for what Alabama is doing is really an outlier and so I think that most people when they look at Alabama they actually see a better team than what we're putting down in terms of the numbers\n[noise] ... yeah but I I get that part of it but you also get the other part of it where fans are going to say enough already a when you're when you're division when your conference I'm just I'm I'm ... positioning here but\nStill yeah no I think it's a good question but we've seen with a committee the committee to ignore that before now yeah are they going to take last year into account I think it's a good question for Alabama is a good question for UCF that's not something I Will you know I Will say that's not something\nThat we put into the model because when we build the playoff predictor in a way we are taking the committee and its word that it wasn't going to do that a\nBut yes I think it's a fair point but I think we also have precedent from that committee and only a few you know we only have a few years than on the committee willing to put in a team like Alabama to fight not winning a division\nFinally UCF we heard the committee chair last night talk about them being at twelve he he was not overly complimentary what about it\nTo me that was the biggest surprise of last night because UCF they rank thirteenth and strength of record and then\nTo dance to Vietnam or twelve then ranking you have to think that there's an eye tests factor as putting you there and that's the part that I really don't understand we rank I'm thirty first an FBI I don't really get how you could put UCF that high given how little they have accomplished and how frankly not great they loved\nIf you're going to put a group of five team in the playoff or even really seriously talk about a group of our team\nI to me you would have to think that team would transcend the rest of their peers and it'd be Memphis by one point so I don't really I don't really see that but maybe we have to recalibrate a little bit on them given how the respect that committed gave them I'm just confused by it because I don't think they use the F. has earned that number twelve ranking\nSays while they're joining us of course on this Wednesday

thanks good afternoon\n\nHow are you I'm I'm great thank you look at all yeah yeah but it\nBuys the Maryland or to reach us is giving them some really bad advice what I'm Wondering is whether the governor in Maryland Kevin fired them or the legislature can't recall them because uh uh they clearly lost a lost their mind here\n[noise] yeah I I don't know the legislative a law in in Maryland but uh the governor would be very wise to fire them all probably not even possible but I'm I'm sure they're staying appointed\nA usually a regents in trustees have to be approved by the state legislature or appointed by the governor with some advice and consent but uh it's almost impossible\nI mean as a law firm helping them and can\nI'm sure they did but uh it it it should be or should\nLose its license to practice law it's it's I mean I I talked about this all day on\nVarious shows and and\nI I doubt I'm now I'm now to the point where I'm at a words to describe yeah the uh do well\nLet's let's started here it's time for that border region to go so maybe the maybe the governor wall\nYeah I I don't understand one thing is why didn't the president\nAttempt to fire Dirk in any way and then uh and then tried it and let's see if the board would have fired him it would have been a ... I mean maybe you didn't want to grandstand although that wouldn't have been grandstanding that would've been doing the right thing\nYou know that's what he should have done one other question for you as always thank you down the road about urban Meyer is the next job because I agree with you that this one isn't gonna last\nThat long no no he's you know that could have a place\nWhere he could go where there was an owner of a team is totally tone deaf to all the history of urban um so I wanted to ask you to give the odds for the next three guys to be the next head coach of the Dallas Cowboys um urban Meyer Lincoln Riley mix saving\nIt won't be Nick Saban um because it makes it even notice Jerry Jones and he knows that difficulty were due to work for a I suppose urban knows him as well a Lincoln Riley I think is the name you will hear for practically every open\nNFL position certainly he was linked to the the browns because the bakery Mayfield I think Lincoln Raleigh can do better I think the cowboys are definitely a possibility\nThat try it well Maryland border region of the Maryland Governor of Maryland Governor the clock is ticking on you All right thank\nThank him at a very very perceptive there are just absolutely ridiculous to see what's happening there brag is in Alabama hello Greg\nThanks for the call So Paul how are you very well thank you\nWhere I just had a few comments Paul uh about all the scrutiny that to Alabama faces you know I Know the guy that called in earlier that talked about feeding the cash cow and things that nature and you know ultimately\nThe country as a whole is all against Alabama because they're always at the top of their game and and I just really feel that uh don't want to jinx them by any means but to\nCome Saturday when the when the dust settles even though they're going into a hostile environment\nI don't believe anybody's gonna have to worry about where Alabama is going to fall in the rye is because I Believe they're going to maintain the number one ranking in and put on LSU [noise] um\n[noise] um you know yeah I think I think the majority of the people Greg are going to agree with you and and listen I I'm all for allergy fans are rather fans giving us a road map\nOr you have to you have to have to think long and hard about Alabama and I've I've talked to a lot of my friends about this game and I see a path I I think less miles was close to ... what the path is you got a little confused but\nHe will be you wouldn't be less miles if you didn't get confused when\nNo that's that's true you know ... and one other comment Paul before for let you go it's kind of like a\nYou know we play a Texas a and M. team did and I know a based off all the strength to schedules and things of that nature that uh they say that Alabama has played anybody but\nYou know ultimately Alabama is is that much for heads above in in this type of our fence that they stabbed his this year and it makes a other teams just looked at much less\nUh uh of of competition I mean you know we ... we ... takes a a and M. and then a and embrace Kentucky and Kentucky zone or a front runner in the east and and then all of a sudden you know uh they they talk about how tough Missouri teams coming in Alabama and Kentucky plays them a\nA sloppy game and ended up winning uh but I just think the level of competition a reason\nThis is the way they're often says they've always been a you know dominant Ron pounded play defense type and savings got an office this year that I'll be really really really surprised if anybody can touch him because if you get in a shootout with them or in their defense is getting better I think you agree with me on that\nYeah I think the defense is is is underrated right now and there are a lot of theories on why the defense struggles early on but if you if you look the real numbers and I wish somebody would look this up\nOr the late touchdowns in Alabama has given up in in the blowouts should not really be an indicator of what kind of defense Alabama's has oh when does Alabama done was the first team defense in\nA tote totally agree and and and I've always told my wife and my family when we watch Alabama play just like if this Alabama team the offensive team that was playing in in in the pac conference or someplace like that where they're going to leave their Heisman candidate on the field for\nAlmost the whole entire ball game look at the kind of points that they would put up in there and and how much more stats that too and company because he's got a he's got a very good

from the very beginning ally about to ask you that question I I didn't really think that it would ever work and I was very hesitant I didn't think that the employees at the human resource agency would accept me coming in obviously\nUh was was the ideal of of merging both agencies together um but once they got in a it worked out really well employees and embrace not only a myself personally but many of the ideals that we were putting in place\nA and also I'm going to be honest I told several the mayor's they asked what what changed your mind um\nUC potential and I I Know it's hard sometimes to put a word on it or put it into words so that you can understand that you know they're always synergy when you have these programs working hand in hand that you won't get otherwise and and to have the opportunity\nTo see how these programs in Iraq you know one of the things that we've been involved in lately a has been workforce and as we're dealing with a workforce issues\nTime and time and time again as we're dealing with the communities there saying you know it's really a transportation issue because a lot of people can't of workers can't get to the workplace because this younger generation doesn't have vehicles they're not driving they're not buying vehicles in line the older generation is\nOr you've got those that just can't afford vehicles or maybe they've got issues legal issues that that that keep them from having that ability so you see how those things work together and you you start thinking All right I've got two pieces that by\nNear a school school zone of fire destroyed a

Crossville two candidates running for that job Danny Wyatt ... and James made berry\nFour years ago when I ran for the office of concerned about the lack of growth in our community and the lack of cooperation between the Syrian the county\nAnd the chamber of commerce and evidently the public agreed with my concerns and the elected me so\nShortly thereafter after a\n... and over the differences between the city in the county and being able to work with the county mayor or a friend of mine and the and the ... river we were working out for the manager there\nSo we started what\nBecame name the horizon initiative whereas we went about to all the elementary schools we have nine elementary schools in our county and to have a kind of like town hall meetings to ask the residents the citizens what their concerns were\nUh about our community and where they thought that would be and ten years or so if nothing has changed\nAnd what they would like to see changed and not only did we do the nine elementary schools we also are those are open to adults and say that\nWe did a couple of visits with ... graders only at a couple of our elementary schools or to get their ideas about community in the future that like the\nPast we went to retirement communities which we have a few of here or there was a toddler Nineteen stops across the county and we summarized their concerns and started trying to develop a game plan a\nCourse one of the we always hear people want more better paying jobs we learn from eighth graders at eight year olds that there was a a drug epidemic that was affecting almost everybody and from one way or another uh ask her\nA family members or a relatives that have addictions a theft vandalism domestic abuse a\nChild abuse town like lacked a lot of child in the black grandparents raising their grandbabies\nSince 'cause the parents are no longer able to for one reason or the other end people up here want to wanted to have more uh options on the restaurant so they have to drive the will to get a little bit of a variety of something to eat\nAnd are more shopping opportunities\nWe learn from our eighth grade\nMeeting downtown that cross will have the inner city problem with our youth uh we've got beautiful recreation part for those ball fields and swing set skate park\nBut it was hard for them to get from downtown out through our Rick park stay far formed a walk so we developed what we called a\nA our own little rural initiative to try and address these issues and er and move forward with some great strides in the last four years\nBut we still got a long way to go and uh so hopefully re elected we can continue with the cooperation we've got a new county Meyer\nIt was just elected in uh in our also friends we've been working together since day one on office\nUh we get together every Monday morning and\nUh at the chamber and discuss uh problems and concerns and opportunities for the upcoming week so basically I'm going to keep the the cooperation with the\nCity and county and the shame or in the school systems all working and keep our community moving forward\nObviously collaboration and communication to a big part of what you have stood for to start your term as mayor why is that in your opinion so important\nWhen you look back at the ... years prior to me\nOnly progress that had been made in the city was I\nState highway that runs through county property partially funded by\nBy the city and that's about all I can come up with that the city progressed H entity working on her own you just can't seem to get much done a you know the city is not on the island to itself we're all in this together\nSo in these last four years with us working together or we were fortunate enough to have uh what was called a a property evaluation program that was sponsored by the state it's like a grant you had to apply for it\nWe've got a we've got awarded that where they are a major sat select or\nInternational uh analyzed properties around the state that has the potential for economic development\nWorked with the county the uh the estimates where there was going to cost about a million dollars to level out to a rocky hill a and like it had ready for development we already had the underground utilities there are all water or electricity all and um so\nThe county and city working together there's a check mark on economic development that uh it's been very positive in that particular or should they done just in the next day or two um there was no vacancies on our downtown main street anymore\nThere's new shops and restaurants opening up there we've got new construction or\nOn right on main street now another new\nA building going up so it just kind of a positive what I call a positive mental attitude that has a lot of people trying to work in the right direction to make things move forward\nGenes may berries one of the candidates running for Crossville mayor as you look down the road what are the challenges that you see for Crossville\nWhere we've got the same challenges that everybody in the country has um\nYou know we we we think that we're the only ones around that have a a workforce problem was where the workers they don't want to show up to work on time and every day and a lot of absenteeism and so on and so forth\nUm and then of course the drug problem which is is not just here it's all over the country I mean you've got the\nUh there's programs coming down from the federal level all the way up to the top to address that drug issues so we've got the same problems everyone else has we had a couple of\nA pretty big uh industry very locations or expansions here and uh one of them was a facility that was\nA shutdown and Kentucky and moved down here to where we uh we had a one of the satellite but\nOur main operations are so they shut down Kentucky and I moved here and it increased that companies employment in a\nOr oh you know go across from the top one hundred for retirees which retirees commanded I don't either light tax dollars but the by their property tax so and sales tax so that's all that's what I feel like we have today\nFor whatever reason you're one of the first people that I've heard talk about that and how that regional approach can help why do you think there's a resistance for Cookeville in Crossville to work together or is that just more among the public and not so much among the leadership\nA that's a good question Laurie I I don't know but if I may or a promise you I'm On a day where everything possible to make the app\nDanny why it is our guest and this is meet the candidates you mentioned earlier the importance of working with the county why is that so important\nWell they uh they're just so many things for example the county in the city of joy and partners to work all day and our industrial park\nAbout a hundred thousand for ... ready for two hundred thousand ... ready or put one hundred thousand or buildings\nWhich has just been selected as a select at a safe side so that you know it's it's a it's a joint effort whether you're talking about recreation tourism retirement of industrial recruitment or or whatever it's going to Africa ... county in the city needs to work together on a ...\nI'm sure you spend a lot of your time when you talk to constituents and the things that come up among their wants and desires of more amenities things like parks and rec things like\nA opportunities for seniors and the list goes on and on how do you balance that Danny between amenities in or what the role of government is\nThat's probably the toughest job of elected officials [noise] but at the same time you got look what jarred you set aside all you use for example\nAnd ah if view ballot\nBut the city or county or ... or whatever then that's a good a drawing for everybody but you know up about ... million dollar holds up and go to bring a return ended up or you can get in trouble\nFinally Danny Wyatt as people head into the election booth here and just a couple of days were do their absentee ballots whichever the case may be why should they cast their ballot for you for Crossville mayor\nBecause I've got the most experience and our work harder for is this a labor of love for you\nIt is it is and I ran into a thin and at what\nA server look out for a lot of ... and watch them

when he came out on top\nNow he's running against the former mayor of Nashville who saw the city through a turbulent economy a flood and into a growth phase that sees no stopping ahead Billy versus Karl Dean\nGovernor of Tennessee belief thank you for being a part of meet the candidates\nThanks so much for having me I'll probably be here\nSo why did you want to run for governor\nYou know people ask me that a lot I I'm a background it is a cattle\nA family business so I'm a business person who runs a company called leak company actually we actually have an office there and cook will um we employ plumbers and ... about twelve hundred folk so I I was a farmer and a businessman and\nAnd and part you know I'm a guy who by life story includes some tragedy to I lost my wife first wife when I was forty years old and\nA ton of my life I've sat down but I've gotten really use that experience to\nChange my perspective about the the the purpose of the rest of my life and that causes they'd get really involved in non profit work\n... kids in the inner city that led to a real passed around education mentoring some men coming out of prison\nAnd and I ended up getting involved in public policy around issues that were important the Tennesseans and that's what maybe ultimately started to think you know what they maybe they have called my life is in public service if I really want to use my life to\nImpact people's lasts for good so that that's a short version about how I ended up writing about and finally decided to run\nHow do you feel as though your business experience can help you as governor\nThe governor is the head of the executive branch of government we've got judicial branch and legislative branch of the executive branch is just that an executive and and so running a company\nA twelve hundred people as that's an executive experience um combine that with\nSharing nonprofits like I was the chair of the YMCA middle Tennessee which is one of the largest non profits in the state how was the president of associated builders and contractors that's a large construction industry organization so throughout my career I've ... I've had a life of the executive leadership\nAnd the executive branch of government really requires\nThe skills that come alone with executive leadership so that's that's why I feel like I'm qualified a lot of it has to do with the things you do is an executive manager budget which is really important and say government so um\nI think I think that experience from the outside not having any government experience in political experience is actually a string and that outside of experience or helped me I think going forward\nAs you have traveled the state you understand the more so today than ever they're using a difference in the states you have urban areas like Nashville and Knoxville in Chattanooga in Memphis that are growing and then you have a rural part of the state how does the governor make sure that decisions are made that are helping both\nYeah that's a really great question 'cause it does it there there are\nSections in different regions and I I grew up in rural Tennessee and I have a real particular belief that\nWhat happens in rural Tennessee actually affects every Tennessee and even the urban centers are our economies are very interconnected world to urban um in fact as part of our campaign last year to bring awareness to what I think is a real\nA real concern about the future of rural Tennessee I rolled out a policy called roadmap for world Tennessee and I actually to bring awareness to that I took a tractor from a farm or my family's in that business and took it on the mountain city and then drove it from one end to the side to the other seven hundred and fifty thousand a tractor\nStopping and dozens of places along the way to talk about\nWhat I Would do is governor to preserve our way of life in rural Tennessee because it's so important to\nEngage with the people this is a government of the people that together one community out of the family can change a state that I Want voters to know that I Want to spend my life to impact the lives of every Tennessee to but I Want to do it by gauging what with the people of Tennessee and together we can make Tennessee\nNot only a better place for the six million people live here but let's see can lead the nation with the right leadership and I would be honored\nTo serve as a leader in the service the governor this\nRemarkable say that we\nDon't want a strong wind and ruin your whole

...\nTalk Ninety four point one\nProbably welcome to meet the candidates [noise] good to be with you what has\nThis election cycle been like for you\nWell I think it's been um educational and inspiring I think the opportunity to travel around the state and to\nSee really every part of Tennessee and meet a lot of great people has been inspiring and I've learned a lot about state and learned a lot about people who live here so I enjoy the experience um I've spent a lot of time in a car than I ever expected but um I wouldn't trade it for anything\nAs you have talked to people what have you learned about what they want out of state government\nI think they want um state government to actually work on issues that matter to them I think they are less interested in sort of political fighting\nAnd uh people are talking about issues that the state can't control it so I think they want good schools for their kids they want to have good jobs and they want to have health care\nAnd they want to have a sense that kind of see the place that is going to continue to progress and they want a tendency to be a place where their children will want to return to affect should go away for school or for for jobs\nAs the mayor of Nashville where did those experiences have the chance to help you most as governor\n[noise] um I think the you know as mayor I worked a lot on education and was very involved with that so I think that it's been a great will be a great benefit to me\nI'm obviously I have a ton of economic development work in terms of trying to boost the city's economy and I think we're pretty successful at that\nI think that's that'll be good um I think that the sense that\nI Know how to work with people I've worked with the you know how to forty member council here to work with them and I had to work across party lines and to try to get people move in together in the same direction are those are challenges but I think that will also served me well state government\n... obviously worked with the legislature and in trying to get things done in Nashville he's it hard to balance the needs of urban Tennessee versus rural areas for example the upper ...\nYeah well I think there are some difficulties but I really do think that they all areas have the same interests some a lot more sensitive now to the world needs you know I certainly understand\nThe need to look at education funding that that affects particularly the upper ... to make sure that um there is enough money there to um have supplements and and improve programs I Know that to you know there's the sales tax in the upper Cumberland isn't the same revenue is has the same as what it is a Nashville\nUm I Know that we have to um work on a more jobs there but that that that's an issue for all parts of the state and I think the health care issue is probably felt more severely in rural Tennessee than anywhere else and I want to be as helpful as I can they're\nOne of the issues that's on the horizon especially when you hear from the educators Tennessee tech is making sure we have enough teachers in this state going forward for the growth that we're experiencing is that something that you as governor and this legislatures is going to have to focus on\nThat we need to be paying teachers more attracting more teachers were losing teachers to Georgia to Kentucky we're not paying a competitive salary and that will put us into the disadvantage moving forward\nYou know I always believe that the magic happens in the ... in the classroom and having a teacher who can inspire young people to learn get them excited about the education um is a critical factor and and to attract people you've got to pay 'em and and and that's what we should be doing\nKarl Dean how would you grade the work that has been done through programs like Tennessee reconnect and other programs to try to get more training for young people and older adults as well\n[noise] I Would give a high marks the tendency reconnect the drive five Tennessee promised I think all those efforts or something that Governor Haslam should be\nA very proud of the um you know nothing's perfect they all can be looked at and you know ways found to improve um but I think um he did a wonderful job of making college more available to more Tennesseans and I would want to build on that\nWhat role do you see for Tennessee tech and for higher education in this day ... how how do you look at what we're doing with higher education\n[noise] I mean I think higher education is obviously critical I mean I Do think we there's been a big emphasis in the state and really nationwide on producing more college graduates and I think that's good I Do think the areas that were really succeed will have more college graduates\nBut we have to realize that not everybody will go to college or want to\nAnd we got to make sure we have the technical vocational programs available for those young people to get a trade to get a skill\nThat will allow them to earn a good a good living I think Tennessee tech um it it's been a huge part of the um you know the success in Cookeville I think they've they play a great a great role in this state and I'd be very supportive of Tennessee tech there there are strong component of economic development in middle Tennessee\nSome worry about when we talk the issue of business recruitment of are we being fiscally responsible how do you look at that as someone who has had to work those kinds of deals to get major employers into the city of Nashville\n[noise] well I think you only make deals that that that you think are good and I think you know I Would say\nYou know we've had pretty good success with that and I think governor brought us and the governor Haslam had success with it you know no one likes incentives but there are times when you have to do that in order to compete I certainly felt there was more important\nUm to do use incentives to make sure that Britain stone stayed headquarters or their North American headquarters or ... in South American headquarters in natural\nThen that'll let them leave when other places were sort of trying to get them to come to other states and so so we did that and I think that pays off in the long run\nYou got a structure of the deals properly I think they should be transparent the public should be well informed about what they actually are I think in local government that is done and I would certainly be a proponent of doing that in state government and you do it sparingly but but there are there will certainly be times when you need to do it\nKarl Dean how do we catch up in terms of our infrastructure needs not only in the big cities but all across the state as the growth is taxing roads and are not only roads but also public transportation\nWell I think the you know the improved back the governor has them did was a good first step I think we're going to have to revisit that issue\nUm you know you gotta constantly invest in infrastructure structure whether it be roads or you know water and sewage or whatever you're not going to be able to grow you're not going to be able to even maintain that quality things unless you're taking care of them long term\nAnd so I you know I think any mayor knows that because you ... once you take your eye off infrastructure development\nWe just have to realize that there's a cost of doing things and and it's a cost worth paying\nOne of the issues that uh has garnered a lot of talk and a lot of suggestions and a lot of banks to among a lot of voters is the issue of health care where do you stand on what we need to do as a state to provide not only access but affordable health care\nYeah we definitely need to do the Medicaid expansion I I think that it was a big mistake not to do it we put ourselves in a position where we're sending money our tax dollars out of state to fund Medicaid expansion and thirty four other states but not in our own states",
