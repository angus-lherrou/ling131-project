Democrat she's also a strategic communications consultant she's been carrying the water for the Democrats this evening getting help from officer Peter ... is an adjunct professor at Chicago Kent College of law also does a lot of work with the ACLU\nGot caffeine ... here she is the former assistant legislative inspector general of the city of Chicago and Josh can throw as you're a Republican attorney specializing in the cyber security\nUh you want her to make a you want her to question me on a point Elizabeth and I'm willing to correct you were going to step out for all of them like\nYou said that the the president's words of you know don't don't hand matches to a mob or whatever you were going to make the difference in the midterms and I think you are wrong and here's why there are the district such as the money which I live where it can ham within the next to its name when\nThey are similar districts where they can ham within our wins and the districts that are football are the ones where sometimes people vote for the D. him sometimes they vote for the ... depending on which ham\nOr human being is more attractive says the things that they more\nAnd I don't think that in in these swing districts ... there there are a few I think in Illinois particularly we're going to see some swings because of Trump's [laughter] but I think nationwide in in the districts that tend to go back and forth you see people voting for\nThe more attractive candidate and I think that's why they told work is probably going to win in the Senate because he is a charmer and Ted Cruz whether you like his policies or not I don't think anyone even his mother has ever called him a charmer\nOn I Want to go on the record is as saying that I I think Ted Cruz will run but ... that's going to be interesting but on the other hand I\nLook in these swing districts I don't think my ...\nAnd all that talk to her not at all and they don't like lend us are sure that's a big problem with her being sort of the leader of this movement and there's a lot of good images and I can tell you on the right I'm seeing a lot of things where she's going to be the poster child you know I I I think that that what we're talking about is that there's going to\nBe a between now and November there's going to be a lot of commercials that are going to be made the point that I made in the last hour is that a lot of the comments or the president reference they may not use that exact bite but they're going to talk about ah the the the all the video that exists\nOf of a woman's screaming in the face of US Senators and a\n... a lot of women\nAre going to be offended by that not just men I think a lot of women are offended by you told a story or anecdotally about your about your grandmother during the break I mean\nThis this goes back to Anita Hill [laughter] the things that they heard they don't like\nThe people who watch CSPAN who are virtually almost a hundred percent voters this is what they see every single day and they covered they covered the demonstrations a lot more effectively I think that some of the networks did and I'm just saying is that with all that venom that's out there\nI think it's going to come through because what happened what ... what what the people saw on television\nWas different than what the national commentators are telling them they saw on TV but you know now that it's not unlike the Nineteen sixty eight convention riots the people in middle America we're watching that and very few people believed\nDemocrats or have pushed again and again reforming our criminal laws so that they're a little bit better Democrats have\nPushed police departments in big cities like Chicago New York and LA in Austin in Dallas and Houston in St Louis in Detroit to adopt use of force policies that prevent them from presuming that the person that they're chasing is guilty until proven innocent\nYou know with mixed results and people who are not you know older white men now sitting in the Supreme Court um are guilty until proven innocent across a large large part of this country so yes well you know enjoy you know a great deal of you know obviously a\nBetter a retirement account and obviously unemployment being as low as really great for the economy and for all of us um there's still a tremendous amount of inequality um in this country and not that presumption that you you you you highlighted guilty until proven innocent it seems to apply to only a of a section of the population so can I I I read Roger\nI Would I Would interject a contrarian point on that uh you mentioned that though there is a white guy and he was a pretty much innocent from his drunk driving crash a thon and his break in at the person so he started go the other way\nElizabeth I mean I think that all of us have done stupid things in our lives more of them when we were young one hopes and after we've matured but I think that I as a voter as a person\nIt depends on how you talk about it years later when you're offered something terrific and I mean I we were talking to a break a justice Hugo Black was a member of the Ku Klux Klan\nHugo Lafayette black was a member of the Ku Klux Klan in his teens and early twenties so his body burned and so the birds and so that's right and so when justice or then I'm\nA representative back I think he was a time or a judge back was brought in to talk about that it was brought up and he's he said yes I did and I resigned now I see it is wrong and I'm Sorry that's what it don't say\nYou just about it and it was after he was confirmed in the Supreme Court and you're right it is what it all saying what they don't do is they don't just\nA dispute credible claims of drinking and worst behavior that crop rated up down left right and I we've been talking for a while if if a now justice Kevin I'd gotten out there and said hey look I was\nA a jerk I did a lot of stuff that was silly I drank I was a a do physical for thirty five plus years I've been you know nothing but a public servant a father I'm a basketball coach and um those days are you know my ... Democrats would believe that\nI think we wouldn't have been having this conversation here and I think the country wouldn't have been as a torn apart is now is\nI'd like to just go back to Rogers original point Roger while you have a great summer I was going to try to get that in during the show but you beat me to it and are are we going to try are we going to give all this up I think that these points that you made\nShould should be put into a ads for Republican\nWeek Trump had not just on the Supreme Court but with the trade deal the record breaking economy and all the foreign policy words\nBut they can ... but they're not\nThey're not gonna elections are also emotional I don't think they're going to move as many people\nAs the as the eye or that was raised last week\nBy those that were demonstrating in the streets shouting in the faces of the United states centers that video I say one way more important than the than the standard political uh of of the text that are used\nBy both parties I mean we we were a lot of people ... Republicans all I Know a lot of this of Democrats don't know if you're going to get that message to independence but the people that the things that are going to move people out of their seats I think we watched on TV last week one way or the other\nOne way or the other ... ice cream ... all of you know Roger Josh all of us there was a period of time you know post reconstruction in the Eighteen Seventeen Eighteen eighties that ran right up the great depression called the gilded age\nEverything looked great the country's going back together the economy is looking great industrial age was booming um and it was the prelude to you know one of the dark as economic period because we weren't actually acting on behalf of everyone and it took a multiple wars and multiple rebuild to get back to any sense of\nAll there and I always there's always the economic cycles and you know what we're going to have a downturn there's no question about it but what this president has done to super charge this economy and get people back to work and get in and with retirement accounts up it is remarkable\nBut look at other people who don't have a retirement account click it all the people who are working that's true and that's good\nBut they're working at jobs where they don't have health care they're working a job that can't ... if you can't work forty hours a week and you're doing a good job and you're still on food stamps there's something wrong and not with you it's with our system and\nI I have great concerned I mean I'm doing great I had the best year my life and twenty Seventeen and I'm very happy about it\nAs I might creditors but um but you know it's I have concerns about people who have not had the opportunities that I have had and who are not doing well and I feel like that's part of America that we should care about\nIt but but it it or whatever it is but it is part of\nThe opportunities that the Democrats have\nTo make that case you not only to those people are ... reference savings but to other people to independent voters\nThat that your way of of moving forward is the better way that's what campaigns are all about ... Democrats and they had such a ... year that they need that they're in charge you know and and and and that they they have been responsible leaders I think what what a lot of America saw last week\nWas a demonstration of Democrats who are not they did not lead with their best foot [noise]\nBut I think did not lead with their best foot their own I don't want it out I'm not I'm just saying the way in which they treated Kavanaugh but secondarily the way they treated Dr Ford they outed her they used it was a political ploy and it didn't\nWork I got to say I don't think anybody came off well I don't think the Republicans came off well I don't think the Democrats came off well I Know a lot of women who watch the same video that you saw and are furious that the Republicans and we don't know how many of which we'll find out in November\nWe know he hasn't got poll that the Republicans have closed that from twelve to during this whole Kavanaugh thing so I think that um I I think but I had were already fired up\nI think Democrats coming down Republican coming up you see Democrats appear and the Republicans very smartly used it to bring their folks up now they're going to be able to keep it for a month we'll see\nThe end result is Kevin I got through 'em that will damaged or washed her own that we need you to get the polls to vote for Republicans over we have a month\nAnd you know voting for the last show like the\nPatron saint of all terrible things in the Senate Mitch McConnell said recently it's time to move on and I expect a lot of the Republican would be voters are going to move on they got their lifetime appointment Kavanaugh\nBut you know who is not going to move on every person who was moved by those videos the other way um and everyone in my circle including folks who are independent and right leaning right or just especially lawyers are just appalled by how the Supreme Court has been really did based and\nKavanaugh's in in many people's eyes not legitimate um and when you get to that weird illegitimate place it's really who who is most harmed and hurt by it and it's it's the losers oh I can\nTell you that my independent friends and never Trump or friends are very fired up and they do believe that Kavanaugh's legitimate and that he was treated incredibly poor so it just it it I mean we're going to see it that way about who's right let's go let's go to Mike Ehlers should go in Spokane, Washington I'm ... go ahead Mike\n... you know a total chaos the United states senator or shut it down in shape the elevators are there is a right to protest in a shovel or respectful manner judge Kevin augmented she lives on the line during part of his chest\nAnd heaven help next Supreme Court nominee hasn't helped him or her after practicing chess lick Senator Dianne Feinstein of California would remind a person that he or she is ... ...\nWell I mean I there have been better ways to make a point but I'll tell you you know from my perspective representatives Republicans Democrats I'm like I'm ... I'd gotten or seems so remote from the border so remote from their constituents\nI'm trying to get out and try to get a meeting you don't have our meeting with your senator try to get a half hour unloading with your local state rapper county rap it's really hard and sometimes unfortunately it takes\nA powerful moment to get a message across [noise] okay we're gonna we're gonna come back one eight hundred Seventy three eighty nine that are half hour coming up don't go away and more to talk about as we do live from Chicago [noise]\n\n\n\n\nPeter what do you think about the the Joe Biden and whether he's viable in the wake of ah those hearings and all the Republicans reminding the nation about what he did during the hearings on them and you know\nI I agree with or with a hundred percent um I Would just add that part of a Democrat\nThe Democratic party's problem is I'm coalescing around a message or a set of messages that you know accurately reflect the candidate they're putting forward so there are tons of messages when Hillary Clinton was the nominee but they didn't exactly fit within me they put four and I feel like if if the party machinery kind of\nDangerous Joe Biden is the person who should be the nominee um we're going to be in the same situation where we were before the nice thing and the other side is there you know you ask anyone who's opened any newspaper in the past any national newspaper in the past decade what does the Republican Party stand for\nInstance I mean I think Donald Trump is changing a lot of what you know historically new but you know strong defense security lower taxes you know a warfare type programs tough on crime and you ask the same question of folks that the Democratic party\nThe messaging is really garbled so we need to focus our messaging and the candidate who\nHe whether he or she is whomever it is it's consistent with that\nSort of did anyone on the hearings last week Mitt primarily a camel Eris and Cory Booker\nA or a senator club which are\nUh did any of them stand out\nTo you because of the way they conducted themselves\nI'm not because of the way they conducted themselves in a way to elicit me like that the person I Would want to see in about I mean the way they stuck to themselves often suggested this is the person who intend to be running in the primary um I think honestly it's it's a pretty open field I you know I like Kamala Harris like\nWas with one I like Cory Booker um but I think they have bigger bigger issues to bigger fish to fry before they even contemplate a running in the primary thing is\nProfessor a question for a second you describe the message of the Republicans were you said lower taxes tough on crime good economy I'm things that we all want\nThat but when I say I'm going to say are making good right yeah I'm kind of wondering who side you're on the bottom [laughter] so when I when I\nWhen I when I say lower taxes when I say lower taxes that\nCan mean different things to different people so I think when you say that to the Republican establishment is lower taxes for corporations when I say tough on crime into the Republican establishment that means tough on ...\nEl ... and broken windows theory low level crime is what I say strong the national security\nYou know that to me means stronger national security in in a meaningful way not security theater but you say to the Republican establishment you know I don't even know what it means since we're getting so friendly with you know some of the most dangerous to a summer and in the in the world but\nYou know the the democratic message has been garbled but I'll admit that and what it should be is basically whether you're you know white guy a black guy a lot you know a person I'm gay straight whatever you're going to be on the same playing field no one is going to jump over you in line because they're you know minority\nAnd we are trying to create and establish a permanent middle class where quality and the the the term that I think we need to focus on more than a quality is parity with no parity in this country\nThe disparities between wealthy and poor are bigger than they've ever been between you know different racial groups are bigger than they've ever been so I think the Democrats you know again I'm not a democratic strategist I've no affiliation with the party but I think really in each coalesced around parity we need a more equal and equitable America\nMeans just getting like communism not I'm not in not in the fight it sounds a lot on his side of the night and I now I'm In my lap or tune it is not ...\nYou've heard it here first folks at the Democratic nominee for president will be ... it will be coming out with her she is in my view I'm\nOn a road to the nomination well I I think she shares that few but I'm not sure that the rest of us checks\nOff all the boxes and that's what the Democrat Party is about an hour checking off boxes progressive\nWoman and you want to point out though what about her background\nOh I I don't think that matters to to most Democrats I think that the boxes and I are paying for your insights into my brain as some of her personal political baggage that going to be fodder in the campaign or is that going to be something that\nTwenty five years ago the people don't want to talk about oh I think I think that will probably help her with a democratic or Republican sort of bottles president went through a similar fights advantages far either only when\nWe've got about ...

makes money ... legal was fine I'm trying to figure out what the attraction news but then again I didn't understand\nPut rocks either [laughter] I guess the first question I Would have though how do

how do we know there's a really cherish well\nWhat do you mean sanitation what if you just had it in a bottle never open the bottle like a fine line or that's never opened\nHer a bottle of perfume that's never opened a what is she what she's doing is drawing attention to her in spite of some of the people magazine reports and other reports say oh she's drawing attention to mental health issues like depression and we have to try it out I think it's a gimmick um\nBut if she wants to make money at it and be as big as her sister and her father ah what's wrong with that I mean I think it's goofy but I also think it's they created a publicity stunt\nBut I'd like to know how you're doing of tears George Bush so mhm think about the actual monitoring\nIt gets broken heart that she does she would just cry her way until she's got\n... and water and [laughter]\n\nOn one thing she got like is that you should not drink so in terms of Carl's issue we're about hygiene and what Santa Jerry she did

hilarious Frank or you could be a beer or do you can go out and so we're amongst the salt water for thousands of dollars\nHave at it Mike what is your new and creative idea to make money on the Internet\nWell it seems like the creative thing is set up a go fund me account and uh that that seems to be the easiest thing to do today and a lot of people are doing that and ah that seems to be nice and simple and and go for but\nUh I probably can't get any more esoteric than that that seems to be the easiest way\nYou know the Gulf on me Carl is an interesting phenomenon because a lot of

in the shadow of Miley Cyrus ... sure sure\nYou know whatever makes money as long as well what I don't like is that this is a big attention grabber for mental health issues like depression when it's a

extraordinary paranormal experience that happened to you in celebration of Halloween please share that with us [noise] sure ah well\nI can talk about the first one that that was that age for a I was in northern Norway two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle where my parents are from we're visiting my grandmother was wintertime and I was outside plane and they got started to feel very sick\nSo I went home and ah by the time I got to my grandmother's house my neck with stiff and had body aches a high fever I went to lie down on this little bed my grandmother had in the kitchen\nAnd ah that's where she took naps I guess when she was cooking but anyway I I I was lying down in the the relatives started coming over and saying things like oh this is what happened to your cousin when he got polio and this is what happened to your older brother\nThere were just scaring the heck out of me and uh my grandmother my mother were very upset and I kind of drifted off into asleep and then I woke up\nA few hours later and I saw this really bright light up in the ceiling between the beams and this old farmhouse\nAnd the ceiling and it was very warm it was very bright it was in the ... what I Would call in and jelly shape and it kind of a humanoid shape\nAnd uh I the best thing about it was that I felt like everything would be okay I didn't have any more worries I I I I felt fine I went back to sleep and\nWhen I woke up in the morning I was completely well I didn't have any any health issues at all and my mother and my grandmother said it was a a a miracle and that was my guardian angel and I I think that's\nWhat opened the floodgates uh for the rest of my life I started having these tour normal experiences are quite\nOften and uh uh you know kind of randomly but but very often frequently\nShare with us a recent paranormal experience Dr Bruce\nSure um well I Am able to um [noise] as soon as I published this book well okay I'll I'll what caused\nMe to to write this book or a friend of mine a dear friend of mine are also of of a Norwegian heritage ah passed away two years ago\nAnd uh a month after he died I ah had a vision of him and he came to me and it was very clear vision of him and he told me all about his\nThe spirit world you know his uh his after like what is afterlife was like and it was quite detailed\nAnd a ... he he actually gave me the the name of the book timeless that's that comes from my friend gene\nBut he told me that in in the spirit world that he was in there is there's no there's no future there is no past it just as he said I just am it's just all the present everything is just present and he said it was it was very it was a very nice and uh he had no more\nBut I don't hear about it or I stop stop stop Dr talking to Dr yeah\nDr Bruce all of Seoul time has written a book called ... paranormal personal history I don't care about his history told me about your history tell me about a paranormal experience that happened to you\nWhile this division Adam was was a paranormal experience I can tell you about it a demonic experience that I had\nYes a loved about Eighteen your goals especially ... especially if you're driving and an Eighteen wheeler through the Pennsylvania wilds or on route eighty or an eye twenty through Dallas those those are the ones we want to hear please share with us a demonic experience doctor\nOkay sure so\nI was Eighteen years old living in my brother's garage I was at a very low point in my life\nAnd a sleeping on the mattress on the on the garage is a floor and uh all of a sudden a this column fire appeared or from the foot of the mattress or my feet were and and went in an arc over my head\nAnd so probably you know I don't know when six feet up in the air and in art\nAnd it was it was moving like a like a river of fire and there was this low guttural voice was speaking in some kind of language I didn't understand and uh I I pinch myself I slap myself just to make sure I was awake and I was awake and this probably went on for about five minutes although it seems longer than that\nIt was it was terrifying and and I uh I got up and I I called my girlfriend and I told her what had happened and then she told me to come over and she was quite well\nUh I did and then when I was there she told me well you should be we should call a psychiatrist and I said well just forget about it you know don't worry about it maybe it was just a dream but if it wasn't it was\nReal higher and I think what no I yeah and it was Columbine and all of our fire engulfed you while you were sleeping while you were in bed well\nIt was like a river of fire a column that went over my head in an arc shape it wasn't a engulfing he was over me\nYou know this is talk of Bruce all of so high now the reason I Want to Dr Bruce on because every hour I get a pitch from somebody who's written a book who's had psychic experiences but the difference when Dr Bruce\nIs Dr Bruce all of Solazyme is a big deal he's a Fulbright Scholar and professor\nBut he had to wait until his retirement to write this book about his paranormal personal history the name of the book is timeless ... paranormal personal history\nAnd he documents thirty four incidents of paranormal events in his life to let the telecom nieces ghost demons guardian angels pre cognition near death experiences and much more it's quite a book but this is a real guy\nThis is a serious sacrament ACA diminish and this isn't a guy who who is in a this is a serious\nGuy now Dr so high you\nShare with us another story like the ... story you you you're saying there was a river of fire by your bed question about the river of fire by your bed right before you saw that what were you doing we're thinking did you do something to invoke the devil\nInside I don't believe so but I Do have a a theory about it 'cause the day before actually the night before a I was a cutting through a yards like I usually do since I was a kid even when I was Eighteen years old they still did it jumped over fences and country are just as in Seattle\nSuburbs in Seattle and uh or north of Seattle and I cut through the yard of this a lady that everybody all the kids called or a witch\nAnd uh she had like blackberry Bush's they went all the way to the top of her roof and it was horrifying to you know the parents because it brought property values down but to us we just thought she was a witch\nAnd a ...

story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change the mind of the electorate has no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality\nThey don't look at the facts in anything they don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\n\nIt doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process\nIf you look at it the President Trump\nWas the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit but the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work\nAnd some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do so you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not\nThat's the reality of this all not that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters in the ... and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it nope they opened it wide you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just a ...\nA preponderance of the of of right of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nI and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done they are there what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the note and whether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know in that because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over\nEverything that we now I mean there there isn't it if you can point to get to the the as the FBI said we only we know that you know we know that are not ... but when the ... uh came out and said that ah you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who were the people that you say are witnesses to this actual event right she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right could cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee\nOr Dr Ford could and she never did\nAnd what those notes she could've answered them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman as fast for them right because the the story came out that she and her voice through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI\nThat's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her and the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know I haven't you knew there and they weren't you have to come to you know had\nPlenty of opportunity or they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate\nWe've gone over would have gone over them right there isn't anything of substance that the left has on the no the only thing the left has is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman uh uh you know you ... you never believed the you never believe the the the man\nYou had white males in the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview\nUh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI and a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath under penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview\nOr you're a little bit of a you're a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe that an allegation should be enough\n... really if we reversed roles would that be enough ... really is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or it doesn't matter the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yeah that yeah well then you get what you want just to multiple unbearable hide for allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just the this was the mainstream of the Democrat Party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat up a woman says it in this case it must be believed not another cases but just this particular case it must be believed now I Know that they generally said oh woman must be believed\nBut then the woman that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being told that the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence\nUh uh you know doesn't exist uh up for for a man\nOr defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm\nUh everything that they sure while does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test ... none of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is the main stream of the Democrat Party it is the Senate\nIt is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\n\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence\nWhen the pollen came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that\nAll her witnesses said they couldn't cooperate it well the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers\nUh the the process was even distorted to that extent so to in order to facilitate that\nAnd then ultimately it came down to one while it was a vote along party lines with with what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what it's always going to be\nAnd it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee\nIs where we are as a nation politically right now\nWith somebody else yup and he was Kavanaugh was up there

the yes okay ... okay\nSo then the senators don't necessarily represent the population of the United states right necessarily oh that was that was his point yeah uh but you know when when we we've talked about this for the longest time that\nUh and we started with freedom of speech few years back when the lead came out and it was the big thing that you know corporations and any group people

the bill of rights\nAh is ah about\nThe individual and groups of individuals because you have two people does not mean that you lose your freedom of speech we heard you know the the argument that on

we have to consider that possibility\n... thank you for taking my call ... or your ticket and but he brings up a point that we have made all along we made it last week made of the week before ... ... you know while this is what you get when you get Trump now this would have happened no matter what\nIs this the the the craziness surrounding it and and the left behavior definitely would have happened I'm In the past Republicans other Republicans might have been\nApparently not Lindsey Graham but [laughter] but other Republicans might have because we talked about how the Republicans in the

to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else\nThat came together and most did on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about what the work and and and the results of the work\nOf this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there and why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together or because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure\nOf the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include Lindsey Graham I was just going to I was just going to ... um\nThat that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the less was motivated because they hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know this whole debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that the young people and I haven't seen in changing the young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you might look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his peck your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times\nAh to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\nYeah and and except for her yeah it's really a ... ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech and like when she gave\nA Dianne Feinstein the pass and the big pass which he shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins\nThe great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh\nUm you know you can only fight so much within your own party ... before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nA ... ah get done as a Republican the Republican Party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is is when you come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional is than they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues right there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it\nYou have unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity part of it is the fight\nOr from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in substance you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sections as he still goes after them as he did others early on\nMade you think OK doesn't really know who is picking doesn't really have confidence in the people out there and hymns sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him\nAnd I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know ... what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham touched still be on the Sunday Morning news show same he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah right\n... you know and that's it because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending\nTo change fiscal policy\nOr to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country\nI I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get to that point where we can change the spending habits I mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that\nBecause that goes back to again what we said the based uh the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the lap while in social media and then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process of the\nUh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially a for her run and that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right at letting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state\nBecause it gives them the seat ultimately on other end the vote on other issues I'm On the right\nThere has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of building building the wall really if you if you think about it\nThat guards guards the nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process\nIf they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in a way with the electro ... the Democratic senators won't be for that do that it's not going to have you know it's not right now but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end and\nIt means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of movement growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that power that castle if you will that wall that ... has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... ... moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed\nThat is extremely productive and conservative and hopefully give Trump a chance to win in twenty twenty against state\nYeah [noise] ... or a book or right by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done and that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before

are a chick six Ninety\nRed eye coming up on the bottom of the hour we'll hear more from Lindsey Graham ah who made his rounds on the Sunday Morning talk shows yesterday and we'll hear from him on the on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if the Democrats took the house\nProceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witnesses back again and everything else that would be interesting from what it says especially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nAh and ah you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different uh women who met allegations are against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go to the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in the Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nAnd he's on the Supreme Court to stay yes and there's nothing the Democrats can do to do it ... there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it and if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's\nOnly really uh they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and get people uh motivated to get to the polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or\nNot ah my I guess my question would be is it a motivator to get Republicans out or is this ... because we can we we've seen it I probably in the past I Can't think offhand up of of an instance but you know where it was something will come along and once that happens it's like okay we got this\nAnd then it seems as if the excitement level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a anger here and a unity remember you had a significant portion of the Republican Party that was split\nAnd and I don't believe this is just about ... I think it is about the fact that you have the as I've said why'd I was thinking when\nWashington Examiner said or a quarter of Republicans are identified themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that\nShows you how wide the Republican Party is uh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that\nThey listen to a Democrat Party in the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane mhm they're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important to so many

Would not legitimize\nMcCarthyism than good and I think I can survive in South Carolina well\nYou know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered\nA there on Capitol Hill that day I think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carry through on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kind of her nomination process we may go through\nA while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point uh the what was going to\nYou know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president\nAnd and and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be\nThe by porters and willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was but of course you're demonized now you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something\nBased on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni is calm and the New York times that none of it relates to the actual case and what he was talking about there it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and\nYou know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been mean to him and called him names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore [laughter]\nSomehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean it seems\nThat really doesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump it really wasn't that ... doesn't get that and I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump\nOr from Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham's or when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday it was based on the lack of merits of the case and the and and on the larger\nBy a much to a larger extent\nAre pretty much the treatment of capital by the Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look the Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing\nTo read the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're their own as I've said as we discuss this for the last\nTwo and a half weeks we didn't have any one I have not seen any rational thought or critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nTo say that the position that I hold and you hold which wouldn't be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed at all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case\nWith this nomination process\nWith the witnesses and the allegations that came forward every single point that we had made which are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit\nAnd the oldest is going to drive the nuts and moral and correct and right\nAnd you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalk about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up go point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lying\nTo\nThem I mean it is again a the ... they just black the will to have the debate they don't have the debate you cannot the debate so they have to step up and ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what well they used to be for Trump\nWell\nFrom their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this older right over there that's a good nominate that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nBut I can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed\nWith Lindsey Graham and John might in the future you're running for attorney general right [laughter] about that but how do you want to eat or to general what are you trying to get out of ... exactly ... well that's it\nHe's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's for Trump we've we've said\nWith the simple ten you know are arguments that will never and I called them simple to an arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always try to bring up side issues that aren't\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right and you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump spot to become attorney general yeah\nYou know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because he was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\n\nThat it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect [laughter] still trying to tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit\nBand and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump and now he likes Trump\nDebate him on the point made on that day Mr Bruni can't can't do it eight six six Ninety road I\nCook with what I

mornings seven to eight they\nHave the morning\nNews talk Ninety four point one\nWhen I ran into a hunting and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety right eye let's go to Marty in ... California a mark Marty welcome Hi you're on radio walk into the show\nYou guys great show as usual thanks like I had a ...\nAnd I don't know if it's relevant but I think that mark judge were to possibly\nA super slander a stock report or ... whatever his name is uh\nUh I think that may do some I think I think that may slow them down a little bit in their efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue to describe it um but I think that if judge were super slander or libel a\nHe's a private citizen ... not under the same rules of capping off down or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was when I\nBrought it and I think it would slow them down I think that would give them food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further um maybe there's something there maybe there's ... they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers\nBut certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is fact is that he would have a case\nOr is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but um he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public a through this with with the league and everything else\nAh that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting you the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak it so if that\nIf that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have\nIn a case there are ...\nBy ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked it to the media would also be partially responsible for getting his name out there and that\nYou could see I think ... part of that and you have in any case there that was that was him yes ... ... they're getting the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yet right right right\nOr the only possibility of backlash when I'm ... you wouldn't want to put his good buddy ... they already the wind is yeah yeah you know got temper problems and I wouldn't want them to think that there was a destroyed theirs in spite of using his buddy to do this for a spy and\nYeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every\nUnpredictable ways we can we can try and come that use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question uh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as the capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge or that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that ... that survived at all was Dr forge claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further\nSo that's why I'm ... and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so she wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor or right I'm just using right that that is a possible exception here right ah but with the other case to me that's clear that what I mean it\nGo in going after cabinet all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right in saying that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nThat says then you've got to make your case it's the worst probable cause as well I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so I I like to just to ... personally\nWell I mean I I well because we're the ... the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this\nWhat role did he play in pursuing this in the media pursuing this and charging you a ... and and filing sue the New Yorker sworn statement the New Yorker ah for publicizing it and and and publishing at that\nAnd you would have a case at least to the extent that well the New York times went out of their way and interviewed dozens\nAnd couldn't find first hand knowledge and made the in this case that would be responsible decision not to pursue the story and compare that are forced to have an ... ah for soup and of course the New Yorkers printing up [noise]\nNews talk Ninety four point one they are the early riser so hard working neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for the next\nWhat you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next and on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a ... she has a spy a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation there and I so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe they have that in their promise their their ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\n... that that law says that followed that wasn't Republicans fault no that was the guy\nThat was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats to stop doing any of these you know with I don't know what\nIt did get them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen massive loss\nIt is but because the reasoning Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office would bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November of twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call\nIt is not always that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... sparks Nevada was responding to when we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private\nCitizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened but he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of\nPerjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness\nStating she's lying and\nOr it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of when you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm\nUh and and so my point was I I don't know the doctor Ford situation\nIs there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah uh any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperated so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it is\nAnd and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats that they should be winning a in a first term president in the first midterm afterwards but almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was\nAh was confirmed ... uh and United a pretty fractured Republican Party\nSo it isn't always that your punishment is criminal\nSometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explained Clinton wasn't the Republicans\nAnd so if you're angry that justice isn't always done all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that is what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged with because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\n\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nA ... for example Susan Rice sure felt we laugh when it said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against colon seems like an excuse me you're on the light and I'm ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you could show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law\nAnd and everybody would an agreement that is what she did and it would still be happy with America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn any thing is that the truth is told that I don't know what's gonna happen and the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and ah I was so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz from my ...\n[laughter] don't give it to my ... like they don't have the [laughter] whatever you\nDo give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went to ... because it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector\nYou're out how they can release it and and still keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption ... improprieties right Oh yes\nAnd and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's going to happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing\nThat's on that yeah [laughter] and that's that that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing we said multiple times\n... regardless of where it falls politically as long as it is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide up because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because that's this would play out in the public\nOver and over and over for a very very\nLong time eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nGoals the Sixers bone radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free

the upper Cumberland seems taught high school playbook sixty minutes of exercising does sixty minutes of football high school playbook\nThe Republicans as we've been calling them out for many years on this program need to do a better job of spelling out exactly what the left is doing and reminding the public what the left is doing a ... you don't have to ... you don't have to use the hyperbole your show exactly what they were doing you demonstrated\nAs one caller said you know just play just play some of you know their antics in their own words as we've been saying for years of that for a year yeah and and and and just demonstrate that\nOver and over and over again and how hurtful and destructive it is to this country or for about the last ... who I'm\nGoing to say six seven eight years you and I have been saying that it's never been easier to defend\nConservative ideology in our in our lifetime because of where the left has gone I guess I can also say that it's never been it's never been easier to\nRun\nPain with\nWithout having to be crude or rude yourself all you have to do is play the audio of your opposition and that accomplishes that in itself\nYou don't have to add on to any thing from what we have seen the last\nTwo weeks you don't have to be as a Republican you don't have to be caught in any untrue right all you have to do is point out the truth of aware now and this is very very important\nWhere the main stream of the Democratic party is now not the fringe but the main stream and I think that one of the things that\nI have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the the the the polls mean and how it's going to apply in four weeks I don't know\nBut the one thing that I've gotten from independence\nIs they look at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God what in the world are these people about there is no sense of of fairness there is no sense of stability for they don't ... they don't care\nAbout it you know taking taking somebody and destroying their life and and I mean I've heard this from from independence on both sides and that they destroyed forests life by not keeping it secret then they went on to try to do to destroy\nA cabinet all his life but on both sides said it it seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's live we destroy we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity\nWe just want to win and we will do anything to when we will demean we won't play\nFair and I do think\nThat there is something here that is even outside of the normal politics that we go through every day that this isn't going to be a discussion if this goes in favor of Republicans\nThat which means you're going to get a lot of independence that that moved in the Republican you know direction it's going to be not be because of both okay will what will Gorsuch and cabinet do when it comes to regulations of the EPA\nNow it may matter to you but I don't think that's what's going to drive it I think it was going to drive it is\nThe very clear drama that we have gone through over the last two weeks where people look at the Democratic party and say\nThese aren't fair people these aren't reasonable people\nRight and I think if you look at it I got to be honest with you the protesters may be driving the left but they're driving away mainstream America\nThe let me think that they're winning because the protestors are out there getting the attention for them\nAnd that they're they're jumping on in in some cases they're bandwagon and their claims the fact of the matter is that's not the case with middle America they see the behavior of the protest it's not to dismiss a claim\nIt is in fact to do exactly what was done in this case and to properly vet a claim to the extent that the president came out and ordered a seven\nBackground check and that Grassley Dave doctor for her time on TV in front of the American people to make her case\nSomebody is part of a good point there because I when when I was giving my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the protesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unit\nIn ... in many of the public's mind between the protesters and the mainstream right politicians that they're saying the exact same thing just they're saying that it's it's not like you can sit there and say well those are just a crazy protesters no because the crazy protesters and the Democrat leadership of the Senate Judiciary committee are using the same argument\nYes they are they're basically ... the the arguments and and claims made by these protesters and their tactics I mean look at even before we got to Dr Ford hearing the doctor forty hearing\nWhat was the tactic being considered the first day the weekend before the first day of hearing a confirmation hearings on Kavanaugh it was well what if we just all get up and walk out over the whole documents things by the way we're that go nowhere\nBecause they had nothing is Democrats always do these days it wasn't about challenging him on his position on\nOn a roll the weight or anything else it wasn't I mean it was for Republicans with sort of my or or Kagan you know what do you think if the government you can the government force you to buy vegetables\n\nAnd you know that that was the question based on of course a parallel to Obamacare but that the left doesn't care to do that anymore so they co opt the claims made by the far left and they have become\nThe far left the mainstream members of the party\nThe ones who were elected to office have become that because they think it's working Kamala Harris can go back to California and certainly get praised there but the damage done by the kind of behavior by Hirono or ... and her words\nAnd the others on that committee and their behavior\nAll of that\nCarries over into the election elsewhere it's not about her own or I can see that and get reelected in Hawaii Kamala Harris can say whatever she wants to and get reelected in California\nBut how did you damage anybody else that's

the votes as Kavanaugh would ultimately be confirmed\nBut this happened multiple times and I was listening on a on the radio I wasn't seeing it but I saw it was even more horrified\nAnd then when the vice president walked out he was a ... by a booze and his is a by a great number of people across the street with me right now is rich Jones or find the newsman here handle in the morning for years and W. okay be in Jacksonville, Florida\nOr one of our great affiliates welcome to Jacksonville hey thanks rich first off I used to but\nEven though it's Washington do you feel the anger and passion down here yeah I think you can I mean we haven't seen that kind of an electric atmosphere at say like a town hall or at a campaign event necessarily so it feels like we're at a distance there but you can certainly feel it and it certainly comes through on the radio on your show and many of our other shows are alive and local show\nA little bit later in the morning and and through the afternoon you can certainly hear that as well\nBut it also I I think that the take away that we have in northeast Florida is the Florida Senate race is really really tight when you look at what some of the recent polling it's been kind of back and forth where Rick Scott held at one point advantage in July from a Mason Dixon pulling their based here in Jacksonville\nIt ... there was a little bit more momentum around the incumbent the Democrat Bill Nelson and he was able to turn it a bit too about a one point advantage show I mean you were talking about one to two points wings that will happen every month or so as a new poll comes in and things and for weeks now are getting narrow razor thin we also have a big governor's race here as well\nIt hasn't bled too much into that it would appear maybe in the ads but not so much in the campaign trail\nAnd burst dissent is the whole country watching a Gillum is somebody who's had some legal problems over in Tallahassee he seems to be able to shake that often dissent just got off to stumbling start when some comments he made were misinterpreted but he may get a republic get the sense he's ready to wrap it up now was there a bit of a learning curve for the\n[noise] I think so I think you know he's he's not run to that state wide race so much he did run for Florida Senate for a brief period of time when Marco Rubio was running for the White House remember this and this was a running to replace Rubio but he really had not\nPenetrated the state wide audience to be able to kind of make the name for himself and of course when Rubio exited the presidential race to just went back to his house seat and likely that made the decision to ultimately run for governor would it be really interesting now is\nThe impact that what soon to become a hurricane Michael may have because the Tallahassee mayor needs to be Tallahassee mayor as the panhandle in the Big Bend area prepares for possible hit and to stamp just seemingly is playing the right political card and saying he's going to spend a lot of the activities this week as everyone prepares for this possible impact from a store right here\nStructure and when you're not prepared for catastrophes Florida seems to have that down but I don't want to get ahead of myself you guys seem to be able to react also noticed a lot of these lines are buried here so in New York when something hits the telephone poles go down you guys put the investment and have a new\nYeah but I I Would say that we also have tree damage and we have flooding which are big issues and storm surge is always the the dangerous part of a storm I mean we get\nEven on TV and you see it on Fox News channel as well Brian where you see the reporters who were out in the elements in the wind is a big thing but storm surge is always the most powerful and flooding is that the greatest killer in in these kinds of events and so\nIt may not look as impressive as category two and three wins but it's the water it's the rising water we saw it with Florence in parts of north and South Carolina\nThat can really be the deadly I'm a parts of these systems for the most part though we've had her run through these and last year was a really rough year in Florida in northeast Florida with Hurricane Irma well\nI Know one thing the president wants to come down and help out around saying this and he wants to help out a Rick Scott question for you from what you can tell the president won Florida and that was the beginning of the shocked him oh my goodness he might be able to win this thing and twenty sixteen but yet some people and Rick Scott and he or friends\nHowever is there a downside to the president coming here full voice vote\nFor my guys you know it's I guess we'll alternately seeing for weeks or but I Would say that over the last few weeks when we've seen the president makes stops here in Florida whether it be a home a mar a Lago or if he's done campaign events it hasn't been a full throated endorsement that that maybe you would come to expect from this kind of campaigner in chief\nFor Rick Scott for example he's in Orlando today it's not a rally it's a sheriff's association and so a number and law enforcement are going to be there\nHe'll likely measures right police chiefs are so he's likely to talk about Rick Scott but I Wonder\nIf the way that the Trump campaign and Scott campaign of worked kind of at arm's distance from each other if that ultimately comes back to hurt the Scott campaign it's all gonna we're gonna sorted out in the next four weeks and will ultimately no what was or wasn't the impact of President Trump for ... got Senate\nBill is instinct is to put his arm around them because they are buddies forbidden former business people who decided to get into politics and not take any money to do it\nThe negativity I heard is and you tell me if I'm right here the ... worked very hard at winning over the Hispanic community and things he does need attention he's given especially the the Puerto Rican influx after the the slamming of there are again they relocated here some are still here and he's afraid of losing that on the perception that President Trump is not popular\nPolitics as a moment to remember Marco Rubio when he was running in that race for US Senate on the Republican side with former governor Charlie Crist there was a moment in that race\nIt was when Charlie Crist gave a hug to President Obama when he came to Florida to help the stimulus the Rubio campaign used the hug and they were able to see a huge spike in the polls as a result because he was able to rally the conservative base of the Republican Party off that one thing so you talk about the embrace\nWhat if Rick Scott is too close and too cozy from the perception with President Trump how might that hurt and penetrate women for example and Puerto Ricans and others as you mentioned you never know what that one moment may ultimately be used by your opponents and how that ultimately will play out in the closing weeks of this campaign\nRich shows with this year W ... how many would this red tide why is Rick Scott being blamed for red tide where he was forced out of a restaurant we understand because of protesters\nI how why he's been because it's an easy thing to be able to put blame on something that's a really complex story to tell it's easy if you've not followed it and you don't know the background of how this red tide situation ultimately comes to be\nIt's easy to be able to paint your opponents as being tied to it or somehow being blamed for it because the average person\nOurs is red tide and that it's far more than just one person or one policy that ultimately could impact right guy and we'll see if he's able to explain that a Carrie Severino is going to be next a you know her chief counsel and ambassador director of the additional Crisis Network will talk about how cabinet will be on the bench in the protest you might get rich Joe you the best thanks\nSo I'm back alright and I'll hang up for a little while and thanks for the parfait I think he came out of your budget\nAnd students takes place Sunday October twenty first

...\nThis has got to be thoroughly investigated are open Senate will do so is he is on the Supreme Court ah and and the Senate has investigated than I was in the house will have to\nForce he's on his record so the house will do an investigation on a shooting Supreme Court justice\nA shirt you want to keep politicizing the process you know have at it but um look the Senate Judiciary committee has\nDone an amazing amount of investigative work and frankly they they still\nAre looking into more of these ah these ... claims but they feel like OK even you know we're we're going to at least um you are due diligence on all of these so ah hopefully if he if he wants to do that you'll just at the Senate Judiciary committee and they can they can share their nose at that because they've already really done the work see\nI used to I just do the benefits anyone for them to do that and the you know you don't do political stuff but I just don't know if there's going to do anything except for get Republicans to the polls uh we'll see how well that\nThat's something we've seen this whole time and people on the right getting so incensed at the way this has been on just politicized by the left\nStarted and and were leaked et cetera the whole time it wasn't something that was good for judge Kavanaugh wasn't something that was good for a doctor for that what she said she wanted it's not what it was it wasn't good for the court\nAnd it wasn't good for America so uh that's not the way to go about this process I Hope we learned it if not I hope that said there are some people I Know people kind of screaming in the last maybe that's what they wanted but I don't think that's what the broad swath of America how they want\nOur confirmations to go now to be to be just a circus of uncorroborated allegations one after the other uh for for purely products at parties and reason so I Hope I learned a little less heat from this\nAre you know I Hope so I always say that I've been saying this now I think we're all everybody's staring at the edge of the clip and see the new one survived if we take one more step and so my hope is going to be a sense of decorum\nOn the next justice or maybe on the next polarizing issue there's going to be a sense that vilify and I think one of the first test is not villain finding weeds Murkowski or Susan Collins for making different decisions\nThan Joe mansion if Democrats want to be arrogant into Joe Manchin let us down and shame and all these things good maybe he'll continue to do that now he has no reason even feel guilty or maybe it will just flip parties you have to look at the picture\nA ... to the big picture but I Want to just tell you those protests might not have been organic I got the sense when I saw Jeff Flake the fact that the cameras rolling the fact that all these are all these people knew exactly what the senators were coming out there was a script and vice news showing a raw Thomas said this about this ... twenty six\nWe also some people who are organized and that moment with Jeff Flake on the hell we talked to one woman who works for ultraviolet who was paid\nShe helped steer people in the right way is to be able to to confront center were paid there were people who are paid by organizations like ultraviolet to to try to harness that energy in a way that would make the viral moments that we ended up saying\nSee that really bothers me does it bother you\nYeah and you know we saw this as early as said his I'm On the initial confirmation hearing to remember this isn't something that suddenly they go oh no there's been this allegation we've got to stop they had been opposing him from the get go some\nSenators even from before he was nominated that fact that we can't have any one of the seat on the appointed by President Trump so uh you know they they brought people said they were people who were on\nTaking taking video of people being paid at the protests during the initial here it's two hundred people were arrested that wasn't just a a you know to a spontaneous ah that that people decided to\nTake ... whole new level of of disruption and I'm really lack of civility we should be having a debate about something is fine that democracy but shouting people down is and and now we're heading that I'm engineered\nFor TV kind of a moment but I I'll tell you there were a lot of people there I Know on the other side I Know there were groups of\nWomen for Kavanaugh walking Hall's not paid and it's and and people who are taking time away from their jobs their families to come in and walk peacefully in the hallways\nAnd and kind of talk reasonably with their senators not shouting not trying to get in their faces and and make a viral videos out of it but let's actually just show our support praying up and down the hall so I think\nThere's um there's a lot of people\nOn both sides and this and we need to ... we need to just kind of return to a moment where we can have civility and not be trying to make this about the next spectacle\nOr carry last question do you think you were there when Justice Thomas who there you saw the dynamics between the judge Supreme Court justices\nDo you think do treat him differently because of the controversy that came through the Kagan ... for example might be in briar might be like keeping them at arm's length like the Senate has become in the house has become parties\nThe justices of different political backgrounds who they stop interacting\nI Hope not I haven't gotten that hasn't been how it had been so far and member of this court many of these members were there for Bush versus Gore I Can't imagine more politically charged and divisive case and yet\nThey know the people you're working with for the rest of your life that if there's no point in making 'em unnecessary enemies and people forget because we focus on the high profile cases about forty percent of the case Easter\nOr you Adam is so there's actually a lot that bind that got this as we saw that several of them were there for his swearing in on Saturday that the that quick white so he could start getting to work Justice Kagan with their Justice Ginsburg was there and I think that's great even on an even on a kind of spontaneous for the moment thing because they were they were\nShowing that um I think the court is not the rest of the country at least knows how to work together they don't show to each other to make that point they make return darkness and then they sometimes\nPersuade each other when one way or the other that's how our system should work and I hope that on the court can be a lesson to us of how to move forward as a country\nAbsolutely and I love without one is Steven Kobe's lead writers wrote and I'm being sarcastic I'm just glad we've ruined his life he later to cut down so allow you you know ... what do you say that um\nI mean that that that that is the tragedy of what it seems like they're going for the hey you know what we can't block you but at least we can ruin your life and that's horrible I don't think any I I just hope that that is a\nNarrow French Americans who actually want our politics to go that way but I think the best thing he can do now is to move forward at the end like justice talented and say\nYou can't run my life I I'm going to go forward and limit on live out my oath to uphold the constitution and uh that that will be I think his best final argument and that is to have a you know continue to sit on the court and\nBringing those ... those really principled decisions and that continued to be the kind of even handed fair justice that that he has been on the Nicorette up until now\nUh Gary who's who's been grabbing a loving your contributions on TV and radio thanks

know I was a skeptic of President Trump a but over time I've been persuaded that um he's doing a good job and a better in my view then President Obama did us so we certainly unconventional his styles unusual\nA button area after area he's been getting results so if you look in Europe he's pushing back against Russian aggression there you know despite the pro Russian rhetoric that people point to he's been arming the Ukrainians strengthening missile defense or you look in the middle east he defeated ISIS he's\nPutting pressure back on Iran and then looking at Asia and he's willing to stand up to China um he's making progress on on North Korea so uh it's not perfect no administration is perfect but I think he's doing a much better job than many people expected and a much better job than

including the people that you said were witnesses they don't know of it so what do you want her to do that didn't stop sooner Hirono the war one of the worst senators around of Hawaii from saying

destroy somebody's life about something that they did he says didn't happen thirty five years ago and nobody else said happened except her\nThat would make her happy for one reason not for Dr Ford for one reason the seat stays open and they have a shot to win the Senate that I Hope people can see through Keith was a news Ninety six five in Orlando Keith\nMorning Brian morning which are in Iran yeah\nHey I Would love to see President Trump started in ... so to the rank and file Democrats that are hard working historically you know moderate Democrat that or not or this is less crazy thing and then right now he started making it Democrat versus Republican and\n... and his policies actually benefit a lot of these people to get your your traditional\nManufacturing on union workers wages have gone up\nAnd and he's got a you've got to separate them from the small minority of these crazies and say I know that's not you you know I used to be a Democrat I have friends that are Democrats this is not who you are in and we got to isolate these these these crazy\nThat to ... that is genius I have not heard anybody bring that up instead of Republicans versus Democrats Republicans verse Democrats or the Democrats have today versus what they used to bake and make them think about what they're doing as compared to what they used to do Marcos on W. H. I. O. N. dating mark real quick\n[noise] uh yeah I think the uh seventeenth amendment needs to be repealed the the fact that the states no longer point the legislate those senators has this turns us into a partisan circus\nI Know we used to do that we used to just decide who should go and represent the state now people vote on it I don't think that's going to happen or I maybe things got as bad as they are going to get maybe they're not going to get any worse maybe we'll look at this is the the abyss that we did not go down thanks more [noise]\nJonathan Turley next\nNews talk Ninety four point one they are the early riser so hard working neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for the next\nOr should be believed and I I thought it was interesting that when ... got to the ah concluding line he said well the Republicans didn't believe her eyes so it's a strange politics of\nA sexual harassment and the me too movement for democratic ah Coons was clearly signaling that he didn't believe these allegations otherwise he would have been objecting to the treatment but he prefers to say the Republicans didn't believe her or so there there's this weird environment where we're living in instead of just saying look\nSexual harassed us have a right to be heard not to be believed by everyone has due process rights and fairness right but for some reason a lot of the Democratic members can't keep themselves to say that because they don't want to appear that they're anything but totally in favor of\nThe me too movement and I think that ultimately this hurting me too movement a bit uh I think that it's clear that this final allegation\nDid undermine the previous to allegation and in the\nBig picture to win Susan Collins gave that comprehensive speech she didn't say I'm voting because I'm a Democrat or I'm voting and I'm a Republican gonna\nShe used to let me just tell you what went into this let me tell you how insisted on this let me tell you how I came to this decision\nAnd when you listen to the way she deliberate it it's hard to say while typical party politics I I just don't you you can be angry that it didn't go your way\nBut as you see there when Capitol is accused of something that happened Thirty years ago something might have happened Thirty years ago I'm not saying it didn't but when there's nobody they can read the story how can we possibly held this man he's not worthy of this seat or it's okay to destroy his wife\n[laughter]\nWell I I this is part I wrote a column recently in the hill that we have finally reached this level of primordial politics you know we've been where we\nEngage in totally on limited on the linking rage\nAnd ... you know politicians have unleashed this in the age of ... you know they we we now live in a time where people have been given license\nTo be rage full hateful and not consider any elements of fairness or empathy and there's lots of people are waiting for that moment we saw that I didn't see that on both sides\nBut what's missing here is what you know used to be said about statesmen that the difference between a politician or statesman the politician things to the next election where a statesman thinks it next generation what we really found out in the Kavanaugh confirmations are very few statesman left in the Senate\nTo bother you or\nMe a lot you know I came to Washington as a page a fourteen year old page and\nWhen I was here giants walked those halls you know people like moynahan end and Humphrey and the Javits and others you know they were Republican and Democrat they were institutional is they believe deeply in the Senate\nYou know when I when I handled the impeachment turtle last impeachment trial or in the Senate there was last judicial peach mislead counsel I remember arguing I'm a part of the case and they took a break on the Senate floor and and center in a way a came up to me and said\nYour jury unless you know I just can't get out in my mind when I was a page because in a way was there with us page\nAnd I said you know there used to be giants here you know and when I'm arguing you these people they all seemed so damn small and in a way it got really sort of silent and he said I think about that a lot\nAnd the Senate is changed and it hasn't changed for the better um and at some point or and a half to decide if the majority of the American people have had enough of these people on both sides that seem to be trafficking in the politics of rage\nWell I'll give you an example I Susan Collins is as I have death threats and people praising me and she does on these shows you back away from the decision did sixty minutes now of people say Murkowski you're done we're going to run against you how dare you vote against them if you want to show that it's a new day\n... and understand it to Europe it's only to your best interests to tell Manchin Murkowski and Collins I respect your decision now you're going to have to earn those Senate votes but don't alienate and vilify this'll be the first test not just from other senators\nBut from politicians and people do not hate Murkowski for not agreeing with your decision or going with her party you harder to make their own decisions well representing your people are and if not as an election filmmaker enemy number one\nBrian I think that is just incredibly well said you know the I I actually wrote a column and Murkowski first came to the Senate that actually criticized her or being appointed to the Senate or ... or I Am because of the\nUh the concert and a half or ... you know that her father was a senator and I never liked that I've never liked the family yeah I the salmon Lynn itch but I have to admit I and I do so gladly\nShe is one of the most thoughtful senators are in Washington I you can disagree with their decision on Kavanaugh\nBut she's one of those senators that quite frankly thanks very deeply most of these people I got to tell you are just grade the actors you know there I you know is the foreman is yeah the worst performance is when they tried to convince us they actually care of this stuff\nBut they're few and I think we're ... does care I really do\nAnything is you you you can't buy the Democrat too crazy to alienate Joe Manchin scanning shame at him and ... and his party no he's representing West Virginia well being a Democrat and if you keep pushing him what is the endgame that he switched parties\nAnd what does he engaged with Susan Collins said she never ever deliberate Republican or not what do you want to say okay we couldn't convince her this time maybe next time\nI think that's right and we're going to see another face of this tomorrow perhaps we're gonna see protesters tried interrupt the Supreme Court proceedings that would be a new low uh you know ... they sent the the Supreme Court chambers has always been\nA place of considerable reverence they're much more strict in terms of\nDecorum in that chamber room [noise] all of the justices believe strongly in that and we're going to see if this is rage full environment that we live and will penetrate the chamber itself and there'll be a new low if if protesters or interrupt those proceedings\nAnd we heard them interrupt the vote over and over again and the vice president demanding order who's into if we if it does translate to radio I Hope it does these are the protests are swarming the door at the Supreme Court cut thirty\nThree miners happening to weigh the pros [noise]\nRussell building in our restaurants that are on the part of the\nSo I mean that was crazy scene where the vice president walk walk back then he walked out again on the Supreme Court steps they which this crowd chanting angry things at him so you're you've never you've never seen this before right\nI have and and we were we've lost any sense of\nControl or decorum I've seen it with friends of mine you know I come from Chicago from a very liberal family and by the rage is overwhelming but what concerns me is I just got back from Chicago and I said this to some of my friends and family\nThey're enjoying it too much that they they're enjoying the rage too much there's a sense it suddenly it's okay to say hateful things one person said I really hope that Mitch McConnell died someone killed somewhere he dies of cancer\nAnd I said do you do it if I played that statement back do you think that you will be ashamed and and she said no they said that's the point there was a day when we still have the capacity for a shame that that is a shameful thing to say but we've lost that capacity\nBut I mean look at what just happened to me or as I'm walking through the train so I mean that and I actually\nI think that's a great example brain what happened to you what's an outrage the fact that there are people that would not only do that but then posted and people would congratulate them me his knees are really\nHorrible people you know there are such things as they are yeah the the people that followed you like that are horrible people and they seem to have found their audience\nAnd they have a and I'll give\nYou an exam so people say well Mitch McConnell used door to this when you did not vote with nine months left in President Obama's term at the tragic death of events of Justice Scalia and this is what you said when you didn't even may meet with Merrick Garland here's his answer cut their team senator how broken is the SAT at\nThe centers are broken away to an attack Merrick Garland a background and try to destroy and we didn't go

satisfied I can say that because he's doing exactly what I voted for four he's been a force for the American people there for\nThe way that people for eight years under Obama it's been the dictator none of us had a voice so he's wrong as far as I'm concerned\nAlso too for justice cabinet\nAbsolutely floored as happy to know that the fibers ball of fire or snakes debating polish snakes called the Democrat Party not all of just those ones that are being so evil or their teeth knocked down their throats\n... you know it's going to happen on November six they want to pay pay you back the Republicans would see what happens I Know one thing the president smart trying to get Democrats who just don't want to get along\n\nIt's going to be the talk of town for me it was thought Ninety four point one\nOn Brett Kavanaugh and he got it across the finish line and and the senators did\nA is a is a big win for him and you know you wouldn't know that if you looked at the week of coverage\nOf it but once it happened a it was a promise delivered and it was one in which ah especially evangelicals and conservatives are conservatives all over the country were really pushing for\nIt just so interesting because yesterday last week while you're away maybe it was a coincidence but I think there's a lot to do with you being away they cut a new NAFTA deal because you were standing in line everybody knows that I got a new NAFTA deal they could they got together and opioids\nThe president has ramped up his rhetoric against China which even the unites them with Democrats on that initiative and with a lot of the EU\nSo now we're getting closer to a bilateral with Japan and you have a a Trump like wheat or emerging Brazil\nSo there's a lot of people who are saying wait a second there's a lot of dominoes falling in the president's direction right now what it on the economic numbers would even through a hurricane\nOr the unemployment dropped now the three point seven percent and they don't have access to that yet and the fed raises interest rates because he feels the economy is healthy for the long term kinda hurts the economy a little bit it hasn't stopped Colin Powell for a for ... for taking a look at what the president has created\nI Want to hear what he said they're free to carry a cut thirty nine\nAnd Congress take a hard look at yourself and see what we are doing to try to keep things things forces in check and put America back in the middle of all this as opposed to being sort of a reluctant player and trying to pull out of agreements rather than helping to make new agreements\nAnd you know he went on to say they do oh we're hurting alliances were insulting allies\nMaybe if you look at it on the surface but what he does he pushes back he says he wants to re can figure but he doesn't alienate but I think his unorthodox approach is just never going to resonate\nPolitical success or failure with people like Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright and maybe the George ... of the world who used to doing things a certain way\n[noise] so I think you're right and it's definitely not a traditional way for diplomacy or dealing with trade deals but over time\nUm some of these deals he's big ones have come across and have you know I mean the the Mexico Canada thing was huge um the south Korea deal on the precipice of Japan\nOr who knows what the EU is going to deliver that promise but it's you know if there's a new new deal\nI'm not saying that they are all to the benefit of us if they reach structuring deals based on his problems with how they were structured before the devil's in the details but um I think a lot more people are looking at it and saying it's an orthodox but might be working\nAnd yeah I mean this is what I what I find is so interesting is that because he's Donald Trump\nThey don't even give it they don't even attempt to give them the benefit of the doubt and then I was one of the people read the Woodward book\nAnd I'm reading this and he's sitting down with generals and he's telling the generals including that is hey guys you been doing this for Seventeen years why making me sick more money into this tell me about a plan that works come on army tell me to tell me you got a plan is going to work\nSo it's characterized as the president doesn't respect his generals\nAnd what it is is a CEO going up to his brother his division presidents and saying produce more Steinbrenner looking at is hundred million dollar Yankees in saying winning by three games is not enough or trailing by three is not enough he\nWants to get more but not everyone says well how can you be so disrespectful of the military but they people aren't even open to we might some of this on north of docs way of doing things in politics\nMight be necessary does that surprise you\nKnow listen people and we traveled last election twenty sixteen\nOunce around the country people or most that we hurt the most from or people that were sick of both parties\nThey said Washington doesn't work it's trying to kick the table over and try something different well this is something different he operates in different realm she uses Twitter says things that don't you know it's not comfortable but\nThere is stuff that is happening we cover the iceberg that's on top of the water and the controversies that day but there is a huge iceberg up changes happening in Washington and different agencies including the Pentagon um that often don't get coverage\nYeah it is the you know now he seems to have more of his people around him that might say oh instead of judging him works with him instead of saying why is he\nWise you know fly off the handle wise you wanna do five things at once they go I Know that guy that's what he always wants to do this is what you do is they handle it you don't run to the Washington Post and say invoked the twenty Fifth Amendment I even sense\nDoes the ways we spend the whole thing with a Rosenstein is working he let 'em out let him calmed down and let the story die a little bit and then they're going\nThe way it works in business in our business especially you know you're not getting the stories you while you're not getting that your your case break 'cause you get all the stories you want to be able to talk about this so said this so maybe you're maybe New York is a little upset you know knows you a little upset gives you a week or two to cool out then you bring them in office on your to an his time or time and then you talk it through\nLike we're used to this world but in politics they handle it just totally differently and and the president's not bending he doesn't care if it upsets people\nIs clear clear\nHe does not care if he upsets people and um and we'll see we'll see how the country reacts or the next you know barometer that we can really measure is November sex and it'll be fascinating to see if if what Democrats are predicting um holds true or if\nThese numbers really don't line up to the sentiment of how people are looking at their own personal economy and the state of the nation\nI'm going to give you a good question for tonight or tomorrow that I think is really gonna work out for your panel I'm In Florida right now in Jacksonville and a rich Jones who does the morning here is news director said look out this hurricane is real it's going to hit Thursday or friday and guess when a hurricane hits Florida who's pressured the governor\nGuess who's pressure the mayor you got to understand is is there you might actually have the verdict on the Senate and governor's race\nBy how they react to a hurricane and because a lot of the campaign to reside yeah and I think that keep Ford is going to again be decisive for the Senate and congressional races and certainly the governor's race a hurricane might actually be composing the music so there'll be afraid to use that and your panel\nDrug such you\nI Would prefer it yes can you

records neighbor just a few days before that actually had\nAnd actually go to their checks information as well as small the financial information so [noise] yeah it's kind of distressing to warn somebody had it and who nation\nWow so they've now got Social Security numbers they have a past employer information\nI'd feel is violated as you and your neighbor half to feel first suffering a break

science fair project so [laughter]\nOkay so I got to tell you a funny thing with is a friend of ours was at a lab in California where she had lab grown chicken\nThere was genetically identical the chicken\nAnd she said it not only did it you know the food in front of her look like chicken tasted completely like chicken and it was genetically the same as chicken and that whole concept is weird as can be and if you take the Missouri thing to is full extension\nThat would not be able to be called chickens I don't know what you'd call it\nIt has to say according to the mall and I think ... to ... to get more specific\nBut according to the law that ... on a case like that it would have to say\nIn a label on the label and the name of the product laboratory grown chicken they still call it ... and I think that it would have to say laboratory grow to where it's not the confused with nice it was raised on a far\nNow under the under the Missouri law though you can't even use the word meat so let's say somebody ... lab grows and it's completely genetically\nBe flak from a cow meat from a cow you wouldn't be able to call it meet at all he would uh I don't know what you'd call it you'd call it lab grown nine meet meet me I don't know what would\nYou all and that's the idea the livestock producers in Missouri and ... and other people are pretty much too fast this while being passed

quickly as possible and advertising and over twelve years\nHopefully down to ... [laughter] oh okay but how does his job and we want it to make sure we had that Christian there in case we needed to a lower those extra ...\nSo now because I sold my house I have an extra cash that they have all that we are thinking of cutting down on as a lump sum on the market to try to get rid of that sooner\nWe have no other data to fully fund four one K. a block IRA and a traditional i._r._a. as well\nSo we were just wondering if that was a good idea\nWell [noise] okay so he he mainly nervous about us as a as or an ...\nRight right so you make me nervous only on one basis and that is that this is unbalanced in the relationship\nBecause these are the proceeds from a house that you had to be taking that cash and putting it into a house that you two have together\nAnd it's a boyfriend girlfriend thing and not a husband and wife so I what makes me nervous is you put it into a joint asset it's money that right now is completely yours\nCorrect\nSo that so if you asked me\nUm you can tell I'm getting nervous here say listen to you [laughter] because I Would I Would tell you that that makes me nervous for you if you look at the two of you is just a unit you stay a unit that's your whole deal\nAnd you are going to sacrifice what you had from the sale of the proceeds of your prior home\nSo that your life together is better financially\n[noise]\nWhat happened what happens if the relationship doesn't work out like you expect and hope and you put all this money on to something then he's going to expect half the equity at that point\nWell except that there wouldn't be a record that I put in money so if they ever did that happen that legally we would have that issue handled\nI I don't think that does handle it I think I think it would have to be some kind of note that he would do with each other\n\nOkay I ... I hate this I hate being negative like this but I just you ask me the question then I Need to protect you\nSo if you would said hey we had this house together before we sold it we have the cash from it and now we're trying to figure out what we should put it towards the mortgage we have I Would be jumping right into well you got this you got that and the other\nBut in this case you made me um worry a lot about you\nBecause it's your money you'd be putting in here so I wouldn't want you to have a written agreement with each other that that money is your money\nOkay\nAnd that when you go to sell it that that would be your money and now let's talk about whether you should\nOf this debt so quickly what other stories are there in terms of debt and both of your lives\nNow than we have a we have physical between us they're all ... wonderful um I own a small business let's not get on that great and we pay our credit cards off every month\nOkay I Love all that so the the rainy day you got in case the unstable job becomes unstable again for him so what interest rate is is thirty year mortgage caring\nA score on an eight point one to\nFour point one to five so that kind of on the cusp of whether you'd want to pay any extra towards that so\nWe have the whole ... in an extra thousand dollars a month already\nSure keep doing that\nKeep to keep the simple cash put more money aside for retirement you own your own business you fully refunding retirement accounts like you can through your own business\nI can only give you a traditional i._r._a. and all of\nIt and I've watched I that's what I'd like you to do that's where the emphasis should be is you really working on beefing up your own retirement funds\nAnd don't co mingled the money this way and then you don't even have to deal with the uncomfortable topic I'm bringing up cars at a four point one to five you're already to gather putting an extra thousand a month let's keep it at that and leave it at that\nDealings with us on the Clark Howard show hello Dylan\nHello how's it going going pretty good how about yourself great thank you want to talk about your mom yeah I'm so unfortunately my grandfather and just passed a few weeks ago while I'm Sorry about your in your mom's loss\nOr a thank you appreciate it and so he had to about a hundred thousand leftover um and my mom's I Do for that was just put it into like a vacation fun uh for our whole family is for the next you know\nTen Twenty years I'm just wondering where she should put it\nOr would you recommend doing with it\nSo the only purpose is grand dad would have wanted all of you to do things together go have fun together go on vacations and your mom wants to do that as best she can would call for a dual strategy than what I Would like for her to look at\nIs going into a a a fine they would both hopefully outgrow inflation\nAnd would preserve\nThe money as best as possible even as the market goes up and down yeah so when you're looking at money that you want to stretch over ten to Twenty years you don't want to just put it straight into savings because you're not going to earn anything on it\nMhm so what I think I Would do is take what we covered the vacations for the next few years ... and put it into savings let's say five years worth of vacations\nGoes into savings and the rest of it I Would put in a balanced mutual fund\nOkay\nWhere it's in a mix of stocks and bonds are you familiar with that term balance fund\nUm not\nWhat it is it's sixty percent stocks forty percent bonds and it's a lower risk kind of thing than going into somebody is all stocks ... and so I'm going to throw out another\nIt's an index fund okay and if you go that you recommend a yeah I'd like for you to look at one with the one of the low cost companies\nVanguard fidelity would be the two I Would go to first or or Schwab and balance index fund again for the money that we'd go past five years from now\nAlso and the money up to five years just in an online savings account that right now you can earn a little more than two percent\nSo it was like a plant they can clear for our age do listen to every day\nWell thank you and again I'm Sorry about the loss of your grandad Oh thank you have a good will you do you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nUpper Cumberland office learn how to talk [noise] Ninety four point one\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nNext news in one hour or on vine news talk Ninety four one dot com [noise]\nUse CBS News on the hour sponsored by their works release\nI'm Jim ... officials in New York City the limo involved in Saturday's ...

than the average house is that right yeah okay that's all I'm Talking about ... if you're going to spend some more money on how much more money or you're going to spend on the house\nI'd better looking than we've got twenty but you're going to spend the whole you weren't going to spend the whole twenty you said okay so what are you thinking about ten Fifteen on there and how long you plan on living there\nIs ...\n... and what's your household income and kind of a crime right show if\nYou spend ten thousand dollars on this house you're likely not going to get it out when you resell it\nWe're currently saving to build her on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance\nYou you're guilty a lot aren't you I mean you're stuck 'cause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy about it either one or nobody guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month to that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty either way\nBut I'll tell you what I Would do I go to Disney\nYeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nUm if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how great it time her husband had but they had a great time and I'm\nNow ... but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that\nYou have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then\nYou're not enjoying your life you live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there all at the same time baby step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile and you start putting some pretty good college in five and six years when you find extra money pay off the house early in that sense that's what you're working towards\nThe middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation and we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something it slows down our long term wealth building but\nThe purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume\nAnd to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for pollen ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything it's only or something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThey have a pet thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about\nTwo years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received like commercial helicopter certificate um however I unfortunately I Need a the by eighty hours or more training I've had to cover a the industry is highly regulated by insurance\nAnd in order to become a sure why NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to go after the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot the hours\nNow unfortunately a a a a job are there any out as a single pilot\nThat moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know with ... ... what's wrong\nI work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice this is kind of like a secondary thing that I kind of went off in bed and that's uh\nThat's kinda why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as the jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nA yellow I Believe it or not firefighters are definitely make more\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work in their regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that you bought something it's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like I'm like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm too far and to take his\nSuggestion you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except\nTo slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time because I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job generally up and they don't charge not worth that much there at the end of the pay that much either\nAnd that's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo mayor right now so not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place\nI mean you got connections in the fire department other lifelike guys or something that you can get some hours in the co pilot seat and get some takeoffs and landings and getting some of the council virtually\nA fork saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a lot of them that we're at ... and both have prior craft gotcha not even a turbine yet but um\nI mean I I've even reached out to people that on their on an aircraft and and the and offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those ... or ... ... ... a lot of those guys are very busy so I can get an hour here in our there but nothing really ... and\nTo do you're going to end up paying for these hours what does a eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a place of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty or three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and all that kind of a deal you can get you know so\nBecause you know twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much pretty much yeah and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on just take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we\nContinue to end the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level\nUm ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely so ... yeah why not I I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I I've got a ...\nI collect handguns and shoot them a lot and uh and and also I burn through some MOH but it's a ... I don't make any money doing them I'm trying to make money doing it but it was just a hobby and so that costs money hobbies costs are on in this one is not going to cost you money it's actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get it\nWe got her finger at higher later then I Would say his sister and then I'm fat in the end who told us\nAbout you

strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yep and um it was a labor of love and I have a father but you know it out and live like that about it you know\nYou guys didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago it was a dollar Fifteen that's right yeah I Know we say that I'm thinking I remembered that about there and\nUm we had to have him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nAll of the some of the mythology litters around millionaire's show up you used some of the research from your dad's in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and they put this together tell me about the background on that part of it what if this or did you do and more of it which combined with what he had done\nI think that the trade had we had worked together really on the in this uh survey for the buck on you know really started back in two thousand trial thinking about the ... anniversary of the nine or next door like he came out in the nineties\nAnd and work together on kind of what books should include and got to the point when we were just about to send out a survey on our sample of a ... and and who were killed by by a drunk driver\nAnd and so really he wasn't able to see the data and compare it to what was there and Nineteen Ninety six and and be on 'em so that

were the ... was there anything that just shocked to win the findings were you ship wow I didn't see that one coming\nOut you know we worked a lot at um some of them escaped though in a kind of behaviors that millionaire make related to investing and I think what was causing as\nYou know just like any of that they're trying to do the right thing on millionaires make mistakes along the way to end that will lead to a lot of that sort of the have areas and then the the ... the role that they make related to him but I think that that was surprising\nAnd then I think all the time I think the issue is that why hasn't things in terms of the kinds of ... of the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of the things that are surprising that were sort of similar time\nI was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nKey points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one to five things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you hang around with and she on the back of your book understanding how those around you influence your financial behaviors would you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it very clear from the work that we've done but with ... wins in and out every\n... every day so it's like I like that they are um that that that social and different but not caring about what other driving and buying and wearing is are really key factor and building well no it's related in that were regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it really hard to ignore what other people are doing research for media and so forth but it continues to be a factor are just not caring about what other people and then you know as as is one of the wave itself well\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits of going broke like I did in my twenties were violently\nWas ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive\nAnd thrive and reach a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think there was a big contributor to me\nPersonally you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where when you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nBack early and I think like he said I think that that on Facebook version of what is a lot different right than what's really going on in our lives to something to keep in mind but we definitely see that and that research\nTo gaining knowledge and composer to invest in grow will that is a great word come closer to grow well what do you mean by that\n[noise] that you know when we study that related to making it and when it comes to our investments that it really you know you could apply to any kind of major financial decision they are making a few kind of comedy as hell before making this decision so I Know the example we get sometimes there's\nGoing to rain but not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not hearing an emotional state where you are so excited about the new income level that you have all your decision making is a little off that he can stay home and come as\nA matter what the financial ... bar then you have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd I often here we've got a ... personalities as a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this stuff about following your passion out there but you guys have you found yet again in this new set of\nDoes not equate to less income or less welded actually ... the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that looking at your dinner or your entrance let's say for your career happy ground and and kind of reality and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear about ... ... um if you had an accent or the art ... where you ... your career to go um you know you take that with the reality I mean certain things are going to be set aside\nFor that kind of again elect a lot of I don't want to hear but we can have a happy here in ... well\nYou know there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does that accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI ... that that one of the things that we can't thing over and over again and again ... millionaires on their way to becoming at\nThat time bent planning and

Fisher coming off of this huge when Saturday Night against Kentucky ... coach thanks for being here congratulations ah that was a significant when for you and your obviously your program\nNo doubt part was I mean they have ranked team a team was playing so well like Kentucky and stuck it had three great FCC wins come on the road in some places in for us to battle what we did we're not perfect we're still getting better each and every week but we did a thing we had to do to be successful or kids play very hard\n[noise] you know ... and you certainly been tested with the game and he was in Alabama is so as you go through that process and that was certainly difficult or how to do how did those games in the game gets Arkansas help prepare you for what was really good opponent\nThere really was I mean Kentucky play well and it just knowing that you you have that resolve\nAnd the resiliency and you'd be able to compete at the highest level I mean ... in Alabama getting our been ranked in the top for all year across Alabama number one and Clemson where there's two or three or four\nAnd you know the quality of players they have the know how you did things and it gives you the competent if you can execute it the right level that you can go play with anybody and I think that resolved that resonated with us it is because that game kept going on because Kentucky would not go away their play great and we had opportunities to get ahead of them and could just couldn't do it but our kids at least kept fighting through the game and being in those two games I think really help\nTo let me start with your ... you did something that no one has done this year in pretty well shut down the ... for most of the game and and the Kentucky off and so some words on your a vaunted defense because they certainly looked really good\nThey did they played outstanding might might ... core narrative tremendous job saying the game plan and we knew we had to this and we cannot let their best player beat is so the first started up front or got tremendous job up front on on the gap control up front I mean matter bouquet and ...\nKingsley inland as ... and ... brown all the guys that we bring into gained up front guy did a great job but our back or the thought did an excellent job of taking the air out of runs\nYou know dots and in a lock and did a great job of reading their keys and then the safety fending off of that in our guys are very disciplined in the gang and not getting that said trying to make too many plays and taking care of gap control because whenever he found those he could find gas wherever and our guys did a great job of that and then ... well in space [noise]\n... you came over from the ACC but you know this week because you've been in it and you weren't championships in at a book now there were closing in on the midpoint everyone knows about the eight schools including them in the top twenty five what what is your the mid term assessment of the seizure\nAgain very physical everybody's got players I mean it's so well balance I mean Alabama's planted a level that second to none right now I think they're playing awesome and they're doing a great job your just you know really planning a high level too but I tell you what right under that there there are six seven eight nine teams that\nThat all can can evolve into a really really good football team there's talent across the border skill across the board and the thing or a side and\nThat's what's always really separated this lake in my opinion was the amount of defensive lineman ... great defensive players in the league or for the years that have been in the past that this has been known for and then everybody can play and it it's going to be it's going to be an interesting second half the season that's for sure\nBefore we move on to this weekend against South Carolina or do I do want to go back to what you started about Alabama you've coach national championships as an assistant as a as a as a head coach and people are naturally running away with the accolades about this Crimson Tide team you you've been there you've seen them how good are they\nThey're really good team there dynamic on off as much more dynamic than they have been next Sunday fancy say some he sees them as they're great on defense but they're young and they still they've given up some place and they've given up some yards and he knows you know on off as the thing about office that people don't realize\nBand you know we had a we average fifty one or fifty two points a game of year we won the national champs when we were unbelievable an offense at Florida State that year off and sometimes that timing rhythm thing\nAnd you can be just a hair off sometimes and all of a sudden that fifty points drops to thirty points\nAnd I and if somebody else or drop the twenty five points in somebody else on and then you're you're given up twenty or Twenty one or twenty two points that becomes a game and the pressure is different\nYou always know that defense is that we used to joke about it I always say it's great it's easier to make good on defense because of the timing and rhythm it takes them off as a nickel always agreed that we always said that when we when he was head coach now is the coordinator and I think he knows that they often just phenomenal and they may not have enough day\nBut on defense and then he you know he sees I hear him getting all these guys on defense listener phenomenal defense but I'd given up a couple of place and I think that's where it's at but special teams also of water on the return game they're doing a really good job there too but they're they're a heck of a football team that's for sure they're playing the best of anybody that's it\nFor right now [laughter] I'm In the schedule and of course the schedules were made while you were elsewhere yeah of course we already talked about playing to the top three or four teams in the country maybe the top two and then you look down and you have three consecutive road games there's an awfully ... but uh I I don't ever remember seeing that is that just for the new guy or is that you are\n... I think they said that after new I ... I mean you're on the road to South Carolina go on a road to Mississippi State of the great team you're going on a road ...\nI mean so that's very very difficult and ah but you know that's part of it we gotta we gotta getting off weekend there like you say this is a huge weight force here then hopefully we can recoup and get better on the things we've got to do with the midterm reporting and try to go on the road those first two games and finish up back your ...\nAnd I was like well I'm Sorry about your publisher thought it was like oh my I mean I Will tell you what he said and he just sitting there looking at me I I like it would be okay\nIn Italy for no pay off our predatory now go I Would like I said what the hell is going on here you know I Am a nobody okay so what\nDo not know where do you ever saw when you're a celebrity parallel celebrity could vote one is wrong with you people all around with the caller\nJust apply bom bom show that's it that's not saying that the more oh\nYour celebrity admitted it misery of celebrity later\nI'm you know you're presenting guarantees that Mormons\nCelebrities has led up all over the top fifty car got like twenty twenty or is it that that was hilarious ... Paul\nYou know you you hate by the way I I mean I was I I was in somewhere a couple of weeks ago and I met this guy and he said yeah I'm I'm I'm really well known and I said what do you do so I'm I'm a YouTube food critic like okay great\nHe's a celebrity you're a celebrity you're like you're at least seen and heard by millions of people with a week ago today we you know\nYou everybody else it died down when it starts in in college football right right you know that'd be freaked out\nI Know they say when they want a boy and he's an ad and Alabama I'm asking me what\nThe heck they're out there on me to ask you a question of what\nI mean there I'm sure there are people you've been in the service uber Maria\nSpot plenty so\nThere has there has to there has to be someone in your life or some being that you hated more than ... ... who would it be\nI don't hate and excited okay excitement is is that good but they say\nHe he like he was going to say my name is Nick sacred ever held hostage overnight\nI think it all but two hundred twenty and just seeing what\nWe also don't align any old Saturday but\nCalm calm they\nSample when we're sitting there going to go check yeah there you know Kentucky goalie Julio I knew what was going to look up and I did I Do like they're doing their part of that goes back breaking up we know that was happening for what was the founder happen there's somebody there still could\nTell that they didn't want to resign or to Kentucky where that would have had a clue I often say may have won the game\nLast time and yet nobody is not\nOkay well you know but he has a chance but he will follow you on this\nProgram what good job you know walk by you know they're going to let you when you tell it\nHey uh I I when I got one more thing to say you they're owed ... being in Gainesville gators are ready for Georgia this year\nBut you know what quickly daylight Alabama thing about\nOh maybe it's like biting got room so that it you know what is not going to make a difference\nThough it may all I Know that I mean there there was worried about the wrong game he's already talking about Alabama games I've been on the schedule game against Florida\nBobby is up next she's on the schedule ... you'd done they buddy all good dobie thank you for the call\nAnd then they have a we only does it go in and they are bad and the judge of of I mean we got to you but it is going to drive the way I'm going on there and if you have that power usually he was in the in the military\nHe was a real wasn't not count on Monday I wished I had a colleague that I have this country has up [laughter]\nSpoken like a ... a truce\nIs right a bit of hail a tear the captain and he will do more you know who to cap the damage good looking at\nHow long it'll\nTake my hat off to the Kentucky I Need a good job in tech but if you've got ... bad though when I hear they practice all week ... minutes\nBut you got the answer if you could play out mayor than ...\n... that was pretty disappointing an overtime\nOh yeah but it was the one big play it turned the tide and the ball game when I moved several several west LA I'm In a\nCase anything I'm Glad that long\nTo see if it was called\nBy the twelve man and the thirteenth man [laughter] trails\nMan he had a big block in the back end the thirteenth man would leave a share you know he didn't call it that was the case of Florida's mild guy but what about\nThat but I spent um\nOwned paypal quarterback I told you that two years ago did you do\nOr die or tobacco is pretty good late last year down the plane's when your boys are getting a whipped all over the field\nBut uh that's life does look like Franklin not to say that\nThat was then this effort now up in may and June ... and then you\nKnow don't go to them about Alabama ... and again we play somebody to scold us with a minute or to live in a ball game got we got this man we're getting this club invaded so if somebody said hey you guys move up a notch ...\nCoach knew how to calm down you know it makes them that we were going all the way\nYou can call a dog in hung over we call a ... players on defense ...\nYeah somewhere about power don't wear band back\nMy Luther King's here we have overcome when I'm home they could be more or less\nThe only thing I heard the same speeds I don't think he had Alabama foot going mine were [laughter]\nAlmost say it is and then I'm going to let you go okay\nAnd the girls now though he valid useless set up the phone or Beau how\n[laughter] [noise] okay Robert thank you very much\nOkay I've been waiting for this moment since seven o'clock on Saturday\nAre you ready are you ready to go last year on the air\nGun editors do some serious but it's never really talking about a while and I saw I saw Janis real it's real good\nI ain't got a quarterback because we don't even know what it's\nThe code I said it didn't turn Dr glitter and he soared around before your eyes the nation's laws and I want to tell you one more time what happens Saturday\nJust put the Florida there's any that's butterfly Joanna and not only that ball three years from now we'll look back on a game and strike that was his signature where that was just standing up\nThat will sit down in Florida Gators turning the program back around we're headed for championships ... which I Am I don't want to hear about Georgia because I tell you when people didn't save\nOur defense was better than Georgia you point out that has more to be the best thing to do that and I didn't want to please let me just say that I'm sure you won't have to ask for\nYour loss I sitting at my place you're telling me is what I'm saying because when it comes to the part of the ... nobody's got a better piles\nLast jazz you know not all have to agree with you when you start calling me a little bit about probably a good at what about that really\nSure what what I said Lance sure\nMedical adults you walk off the floor together is written America's you know it's a man why don't you let it better for the last\n... last this man is me he's right boots why that is a headline anything wrong yet but the guy about it the John hazy called you out to a couple of weeks ago\nKnock on your call mark to get out they wanna laugh the other side of secondary in that sense\nWhat about illegal activities right you're right you got to the energy bill can you make it is now all they have to do is be Georgia and they're going to be in\nThere you go on several minutes talking about making sure\nDo you want your everyday didn't want to work but they don't do that without the dog thing about like the third\nQuarter when it comes to ... we don't have a caller are you ...\nYou know I Know I Know they have jobs you know what they say why why do I have this damn [laughter] can we not I'm just curious I don't want to hear why have the giants\nHer name because he's got SEC football knowledge we know how you got the job ... what we think is why you get to the\nRule idle era I still didn't tell me how I got the job though\nAnd I certainly Missouri was what it was you know Tennessee in Vanderbilt at home I mean it's just it just doesn't hold up\nA certainly against the counter scheduled that you've seen a LSU negotiate to this point and ah so I I think you know Kirby Smart admitted as much today I'm not sure what clip you played there but you know that the that the test starting out and now for their team kind of everybody\nHere is acknowledging it and talking to the players you know after that news conference I mean they they seem kind of easier to find out themselves you know they they everybody wants to know\nOr how good they are and and they do too\n[noise] so let's talk about the good and bad and obviously there's not a lot of bad with the team that's where this program ... reverse what you liked and then maybe secondly what would you be concerned about especially considering the opponent Saturday and the site\nYeah I'm ... years you know I mean I've got the same concerns that most people do you know as far as this team and that a a ... but\nIt's sort of a concern and it sort of string in that they have not put a game together I mean they have put a complete game to get it and that's hard to believe if you sit there and go through their gain by game and you look at the margins victory and that kind of stepping Jake promise hardly played in the fourth quarter at all a lot of these starters have has seen very little time\nOr in the fourth quarter yet there's something I don't know you always come away with every game going and you know kind of a kind of a may what's up man said that the ... you know that's kind of ... you put that ... gene next almost every game\nBecause uh they they sort of do what they need to do to distance themselves from their competition and and I you know I guess in Georgia in ... in Alabama the two of them would probably done a better job of building debt than\nAny two teams in the history of college football because they've just plate so many backups but the flipside of that is also I think it's kind of hurt him in terms of a a continuity and everything whether it be defensively are often simply you know they just haven't put the\nWhole thing together and then this last week I mean you know some of it I thought you had a ton of an overzealous crew that was a ... a lot of yellow hang these blowout blind on the field a lot um but you know a hundred and fifty yards and penalties and and ah you know that was just kind of sloppy and and robbed the game of rhythm and float\nTo but on the flip side of it you know this Pina's very young Paul it said the youngest in the SEC fifteenth youngest in the country but I have no reason to doubt University of Georgia is a crime\nTeam and we're at the halfway point so the caller is they're going to keep getting better and are there you know this will be a great ... put together a a full game because they haven't done it as of yet\nYou mentioned Jake from and we've seen a little bit of fields above ... where are we on that and is there any reason to see or what we've seen that other places like ... like Clemson that we may see more of the younger player of course they're both pretty young\nYeah I still toss still fall on the side you know I don't see this as\nJustin Fields threatening to take over at this point I just think he is different and I think it's good for Georgia I mean I think he's just a bunch of options and I don't think he's short garbage either I just think he's different I mean Jake from is playing it as an extremely high level that was very\nEvident in the Vanderbilt game that's the first time that Jim Cheney kind of took a\nTook the governor often lead Georgia shorter go faster than the hurry up and throw the ball and\nAround and this is what Jake problem like this is what he did to add house than county for four years as a starter a in Warner robins Georgia and set all kinds of a passing records in the state of Georgia that's what he likes to do but I think George has been a little bit of protective of the defense I think he's trying to\nEstablish a balance and and and clock control\nA and they kind of threw that out but when they could afford to throw that out the window a little bit against Vanderbilt now Ellie she was a completely different animal as we all do\nAnd a ... you know but I think what Justin Fields gives them as an option is if you know fellow she's getting in there and they're getting a lot of pressure on the passer uh they're they're a blitz in the run game and and and stopping that well then you can put a guy like that in there who can\nMake some things happen with some legs and sort of maybe maybe a\nLoose it up slow down a pass Russia a little bit but Jake problems he's still the the the quarterback of this team and I think he's the one who\nReally makes that office of ... that often go and they have a lot of options right now and and they seem to be getting a little bit better every week but in my opinion\nAs ... as we look ahead of this week uh I think it's not really a a leap to say this was a game of the year to date\nIn the SEC a little bit of luster taking all put store to a defining moment for the league of what do you think for George or will be the key or keys to winning this game\nWell these games are they are always comes down to turnovers you've got to take care of the football\nAnd be composed in an environment like that that you know I think we're all this morning I uh except for maybe yeah gator fan\nOr to see all as you go down in that game this past weekend but I don't think it effectively changes much about the complex in the complex you know the game or the tone of the game or anything like this uh listen Paul I don't know how ever than it is when you're in but the the\nThe bulldog nation as it were they are they're migrating and mighty numbers up to New Orleans and\nIn Baton Rouge just repack dog nation who I'm a writer for the jaycees\nWebsite dedicated the Georgia you know we've got a dog nation invasion Baton Rouge special trip going on a a place called dog day shuttle\nHas fifty buses chartered do and from the superdome the Baton Rouge\nOr on Saturday and it goes on and on and on like that you were just like the only fan base left right now 'cause all the Alabama fans are jaded and nobody else\nIs really recent history of George as they're they're excited and do an everywhere so this is gonna be a crazy scene because

I'm not saying you did but we have someone who did\nOkay well I I don't have the confidence and this guy\nAnd we had I let me ask you this question was you know events makers fault\nOr\nDid the receivers not get to the ball that ...\nDidn't get to the ball well that's true but I mean if you saw the first play the first place we went straight down the field at scored ... we never did that again\nWe went into conservative mode like we usually do an end to the feds changed and Florida picked it up and we were in a defensive mode again and LSU does not do good in defensive mode\nSo this is what's scaring me is is a is go to the fence mode against Georgia and it won't be a twenty seven I think\nGay or it'll be employed offensive against Georgia because there are two no\nAbsolutely not so that's what scares me is is co Joe you know he needs to to get this coordinated open up this all pants somehow and and uh so borough is pretty good if he can stay in the pocket and throw the ball but it is often\nThe there's there's subjects nothing's going on with that often supplying\nLet's let's let's let's ... I'm not trying to a counter everything you're saying but uh the Ford defense played with great abandoned the Saturday and all that struck to rent though Georgia probably has a better defense\nYeah exactly that's that's you know it and it was at Florida that that made a difference too so but anyway that's that propose on trying to make is is we need to his office coordinators date to look at these game\nA stance or their pictures whenever they look at and change some of the tactics on how they do this stuff okay Paul\nI'm with you later and make sure I got I'm calling into as soon as I go I get off and\nMy telling me better shape up uh Jason is up next\nFall how's it going to the senior in Gainesville, Florida thank you dealing with it was hot as the war\nThat oh well we're going to remember your where do you expect to you don't expect a blizzard in Gainesville\nKnew it was it was typical games but whether the lord ...\nLarry Spence of law then everything's in rich\nLehman roots good but don't you know\nI've been playing the song the split a blow to go there for the past\nTen years you know they they were these games and then to the bar we they start the climate\nI mean do you do see that coming ahead of both I mean I Know the deepest but will they but they also do the employees I'm not so we got to children should be because we know\nThat may end up at the line with ... ... we've got two hundred yards rushing against the you know a decent beat them so what do you see\n[noise] I uh [noise]\nI see Florida was with a pulse I Do I'm not sure that uh they can be Georgia but I think they can certainly make that a fascinating game and I didn't think that I I didn't think that for weeks ago\nThat I don't think anybody did I put the Kentucky now so I mean I I mean when you make it up to three wins\nTennessee come on I mean\nTo a Tennessee has got nothing going All right so far this year and they took advantage of mistakes by Tennessee and they they blew them out\nMississippi State was uh was was a vulnerable team and then in ... new came up with the right college or the right time and he did it again this area I mean Dan on is is like a ... is on a hot shrink right now is the play car\nThat doesn't mean a it will you can do that against Georgia but but it it also shows how good he can be\nWith the right personnel ah I liked what I've seen\nDo I think Florida will run the table from here I I Do not thank you very much for the call appreciate it very very much let's go to Rob in Salt Lake City good afternoon Rob\n... going at all ... thank you say one thing I think George as I said please pass which they have all the fans they can take the rest of the ... and I'm looking at a thirty four Seventy eight against LSU\n[noise] well\nAh I present the suggestion Pete is up next in Charlotte hello pay good afternoon\nHey Paul finally get to get back through there I'm Glad I didn't get through last year when I was calling upset special Florida\nGeorgia [laughter] well it will ... I was a missed by orange\nYeah I think they got them this year I think that the fences really strong and I think they're going to put a little bite on them bulldog so what do you\nUh I'm not ready to

run away from me but you can't run away or Chauncey Gardiner Johnson when you make an agreement with him right so spears had he had to come back with with\nSome blue and orange it looks good on them that you almost wonder for\nStop man they didn't offer but if they would have gone out weren't good enough to go for or what good enough to do the school up in the courts\nI don't know maybe that their life was wrong there was a I was a good ... good\nWhat's up all day yesterday Paul [laughter] not much I'm just started this as a little stairs now Matt ... that's going to have to forget forget that game what's supposed to talk about what's next for you know it shouldn't be a big George come into town you\nAre not that you didn't know what I'm trying to transition so you\nMay be maybe up your mood or the ... century and swimming pool I got to be honest I think Georgia as\nTop level athletes they do a tremendous job and now they're using just feels as well which is adding another wrinkle to they're often defensively I still see some things from the front seven were Georgia that I Want to see improved and and as time goes\nBy you suspect that Kirby will get those things fixed as well but this will be a tough job it's a lot of young kids on Georgia football team that's never played in a valley so for them getting into the atmosphere and\nAnd and really finding out what it means to play on the road and Baton Rouge on a Saturday Night is different two thousand one Georgia came when we were not even on the radar really and I'm\nDavid Greene was the quarter back they had a lot of really good players the expectations for them that season was very hot and after the game I remember talking to David Greene and was like this atmosphere affected us\nSo let me ask you ... your your last year of the game was in the afternoon when his game I remember\nWell I'm Still obsessed with her about it\n[laughter]\nI got through it All right that day I can live with that will be a what\nIs the difference so ah you play in the afternoon as the visiting team versus pulling a night and I like most of your game tonight\nWe played there at night one time when I was a red shirt freshman\nA jet Marcus Russell was the quarter back then I remember at that point we weren't very good so it wasn't really crazy\nAre the only other time I'd ever seen it or was it two thirty so I never seen it at at nighttime time now you look at just how wild that place gets at two thirty as compared to how wild it is at eleven uh it's noticeably different\nSo I can only imagine what an additional four hours probably look or the other as a as a home team is the difference\nJust your surroundings Paul I mean look we we used to oh Florida's crowd this past weekend play a major factor\nIn this game as far as players were Jews in late in that game Florida was still going to like the game and it just started a lot of that stuff translates that's why when we talk about schedules and when we talk about records at the beginning of the season Greg and I talked about this on the oil if is to act\nIn front of that name on the school it changes the dynamic of the game I mean because this conference is has been built\nAnd I think will always be built on the fact that how good are you on the road we've seen a lotta FCC teams in the past so just by not being at home so I'm not saying that Georgia is the better football team I don't think anybody know or would dispute that\nBut the elements for a lot of these guys as nobody experience playing there will be a bit different\nChallenging too especially when you are a traditional team that goes on under center like shotgun silent Cal no problem\nHonestly earshot gun team solid count I'll wake up my finger I'll give you the I'll give you the gun sign a little wiggle ah I'll lift my leg off clap what habit what have you it's not really that challenging because you're just working off of ... and\nA and there's not a lot of communications mostly signals and um when you are a traditional team that huddles and your understanding\nSo your voice and becomes a lot more challenging so what teams have actually started to do is go silent count while under center Georgia doesn't do that or at least I haven't seen them do that so\nUh that's going to be a challenge to this is actually one of those rare instances where being a shot guns style team that relies exclusively on non verbal communication that benefits you in an environment like this\nTalking to a greater markets are so many stories over the weekend and uh we've already heard you guys heard it this morning a shortage of Auburn fans really unhappy they play Tennessee that that shouldn't be as big a challenge but they have almost they have a lot of important games including the woman two teams in the country\nWhat what are you saying to a ... you know the way through a season that's quite quickly getting away from them I\nI mean the frustration I totally understand that we talked about this all the football team and poor I don't know if you remember when we were SEC media days I wasn't as high as ... as everyone else was I thought they would be good in the front seven\nUm but people were talking that they're going to dominate the whole league and this was the team I just did not see that because I always say in like I told you a thousand times before and Angie when Auburn is not a successful running football team it filters through their whole team\nIt's not just a bad all finch it filters to the deepest like we if we break the game down like we do as analysts\nThe defense was Mississippi State and the both forty one minutes in that game\nYou're not going to be a successful defense playing that many snaps\nAgainst that type of off as best physical it got to appoint what Mississippi State was literally just imposing their will only got the front of a but it's it's a product of the inability to run the football and control the cloth and has been good every time every time we've seen ... every time we've seen are bringing a championship\nLevel it's been a good running back\nIt's been a thousand your Russia it's been the or peel off of the fact that you get ... guys up in the game and make the respect that\nWe saw the team change will carry on Johnson got hurt ... now we're in a season where I think what was going to be a good football player I really do think he's going to be able to run a bit but right now our brains formula or they don't have another go to\nWhen that doesn't work and that's what that to me that's the biggest glaring problem with all bringing males only they have it figured out when they don't have that element of all fence\nHow to adjust to make themselves better on us out of the ball\nSearching bad and if you look at their plan going into the game on Saturday you're going to the role outs\nBy Jared ... which cuts the field and a half but it reduces the stress on the offensive line you're gonna miss direction and counter place because you're trying to basically gain angles because you don't feel confident enough in your guys up front to block it at the point of attack\nAnd then you're going to see guarantee that I'm seeing the rush and not reacting\nHe's worried in the pocket jets to them is not comfortable\nBecause he doesn't trust his office of line and when you're not comfortable as a quarterback you get indecisive and when you're indecisive you make overthrows never at least three different occasions on Saturday and wish there were touchdowns on the field and shared set of overthrew the wide receiver one of which was on a wild cat reverse pass\nThey overthrew by Fifteen Years I mean that's a tough you have to walk in and you under thrown back Fifteen Years and he runs back to the ball catches it and then goes it's probably still a touchdown ...\nHas to elevate his play but he's going to be a first round pick and he has the arm talent to do so he really does\nHe has to display the ability to carry the team and he hasn't been able to do that he is not over compensating\nNeeds to be able to the quick passing game has to be better the accuracy on deep also has to be better he is leading to many big place on the field and when he started hitting those big place that's going to open up the run lanes but no one's going to be scared of a quarterback that's going to overthrow wide receivers on a consistent basis\nI just [noise] I go back to to\nSome of what you said you never seen them successful without a run game I have never seen as being good without being able to dictate that part of the game and you know like you said Jared has to overcome that we talked about a week when it gets worse and\nYou can't come away from a situation like this and not to\nHeal the human emotion of the tragic loss these families are suffering CBS News update I'm Pam culture\nI'm Jim just go with your money now if you're

know almost going to get the every weekend against a decent team if their\nQuarterback cannot keep the ball took it up on his shoulder and get about five to seven yards we're going to get beat\nSo let

right is derived from the Latin term catch or in a tangle\nRight which is what I've always said well how did I use it wrong\nWell they're going to go into a speech the president or the peach right you you've left out the the whole process of ... that you\nKnow I haven't how John idled bottle that you've been listening very well going to go through what I Know and what I've always said and then you can correct the other media members have you on and I definitely want you to talk about it when you're making a really bad assumption here what I've said is the Democrats are running on the idea that if they get the house of representatives back they will impeach the president impeachment doesn't mean remove\nBill Clinton was impeached he but he wasn't convicted impeachment is you bring articles of impeachment you alleged that they somehow\nData crime of of of impeachable substance which would be high crimes and misdemeanors you bring those articles of impeachment in the house of representatives if the Democrats won the house they'd be able to do that then it would send it to the Senate and the Senate because it's still dominated by Republicans who doesn't have a sixty seven member majority that would ever convict\nThen the guy wouldn't be removed it would go away they would do is only the mock things up I Know exactly what it beach but it is but you sound like you're very knowledgeable guy maybe you could say it in a better way than I just did and I love for my listeners to hear it but please don't make that assumption\nWell\nI Am wrong if if it's exactly how you portray oil yeah I've always said it that way always\nOkay in the ... court for impeachment trials is the United States Senate and the chief justice of the United States Supreme court presides over the trial okay in a super majority of two thirds of the senators has to vote to convict\nYeah you'd have to have sixty seven as I said\nRight and Andrew Johnson was the first president to be a beach right one by one vote and then Bill Clinton was in college but I had no idea what to\nYet another vote tally on on that either but we did talk to Ken Starr a few weeks ago here and ah he was he was impeached he was actually right and I and I ask Ken Starr was it because he lied under oath settled that plus the structure of of justice but more importantly it was um\nAbusive power was the main reason why I Bill Clinton was impeached and you're right it went to the Senate he was found not guilty\nCorrect and ... are the charges are trees bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors\nWhich is kind of weird to to describe a high crime and misdemeanor I think back to the house of representative the Democrats think they've got Trump structuring of justice because of what he allegedly said to call me which again there's nothing there and on on Kavanaugh I have no idea what they think they have other than potentially perjury\nUm in his testimony which can't be proven because I don't know how you go back to Nineteen eighty one to find out who's telling the truth or not\nOkay the only really get a pass on this is what I Do I ... I don't know don't don't die so you know it's it's\nProbably find ... it's actually understandable why you would assume that everybody in the media is doing the same thing because the vast majority of Americans John and I think you know this and it's why you called in they think when you say you impeached means removed and it doesn't mean that at all it's just it's just started the process in the house that ends up in the Senate and it's very very hard\nTo impeach somebody and if the Republicans still have a majority in the Senate and they probably will after November it's going to go nowhere but I'm not really sure why the Democrats think running on that let me ask you this because you sound like a smart dude and I think you probably have a good answer to this do you think the Democrats are running on impeachment because most people think it means remove\nWell yes I Do I think the I think that Democrats do because I don't think they're smart enough to read history books or school or the beach\nBut [laughter] [noise] British probably true ah it's as simple as go ... they just haven't done it\nRight but uh and and that's good or for worse for the the the the Republicans to go out there and really fire up the vote\nSo we make sure that we have the majority of the house of representatives and we have a majority in the Senate\nSo you know this this hopefully will light a fire or Paul Ryan's let's go to college in Northfield our butts out there to go out there are stark ... for the ... the Republicans that are running for office\nJohn I hear you and I appreciate your brother that I Do appreciate you wanted to educate but the ... you know I'm a little sensitive like that I Try to make sure that I'm right but more and more than ... ... so you're going to say I'm wrong make sure that you show me how Iran are backing up mhm\nExactly right it's not that hard art or John we appreciate your age eight eight nine four one bags editing nine for one Seventy two four seven are they still they still doing the dog and pony show in Washington\nSan Francisco right you know it talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court sixty million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest as the eleventh and they are only thirty and thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very person very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power\nAnymore say over Alaska so for at least to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous and the other thing is that\nTrump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing Al Gore only decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nIn terms of resources to help our country become more energy independent that inherent link between energy and security energy and prosperity that's ... that's our oil and gas development here in Texas and elsewhere\nThat Lisa would put that in jeopardy and\nGave that to her he gave that to her to Alaskans but it was through her and for I mean that was a a\nReal nice thank you ... ... ...\nIt just it just doesn't make any sense of general pale and of course you know so appealing [laughter] um I I got to jump on that we are reliant on people in the middle East that don't necessarily like us\nWhy not going to and from what some of the judges have said it's two hundred years were the ... and ... why wouldn't we going to become self reliant and turn the spigot off to these bad guys and and by the way we used to Murkowski voted no I Want everybody watching and listening\nOfficially it's an it's a a a president vote because later she changed it for danger was going back to his daughter's wedding so she said I'm just going to vote president disorder counterbalance when his vote would have been but she on the record in the first round shed no\nLiterally am absolutely so that that typical political ... that's a typical politician wanting to kind of play both sides if she truly had a problem with Kavanaugh\nBeing on the bench and she said he's not the right man for the bench then she her boat then at the final vote what reflected that instead of say oh well I Do this because it's not really count any way that we don't really believe something if you have that cup is pointing due north\nKnowing what the right thing is to do then you fight for that but instead very wishy washy and she learned you know\nIn the middle of the road get hit on both sides directly\nWrites Sarah building a former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party to vote was also the former governor reached native of Alaska in just a great person and I love the we're having this conversation are you going to take Iran because your tweet might have been the best we are there were seen this entire year\nIt was a Lisa Murkowski I can see twenty twenty two from my house\nTalk right is that going to happen\nYou know the only thing that keeping me from just being falls to the wall enthusiastic about the idea is twenty twenty two so far away to fit that yeah I mean that's almost frustrating looking\nThat far but for some like me who's always preaching to people stand up make a difference take the gifts and talents and opportunities God's created for you and\nThe different well you know I Can't just keep preaching it and not jumping and also so at some point one of these position I Would so desires serving of this country and we'll see where that goes before I forget yeah sure what we're talking about the second amendment which\nJudge Kavanaugh is he's he's absolutely pro constitution right there\nThat can happen at least the hesitating Leigh voted for President Obama's picks on different judicial\nPositions including getting there on the DC circuit she's pro abortion totally anti gun anti commonsense constitutional is she and leave no problem at all\nSo she can to to um exercise to vote 'em up and down it was always up\nFor Obama's picks but wouldn't give that same respect and I think consideration for a good man like Kavanaugh another problem that we used to have and the Trump hats\nIs that we had many never Trump burst around her rather than have proper\nAnd um she hired a lot of never Trump first then has hired a lot of never Trump worse and some of these folks you know we keep warning him about you can't win them over there going to continue to undermine and that's quite unfortunate for the ... movement\nBut why did we were given are under her name is just to get the votes in Alaska hoping that people won't pay attention to the record what you just said just now in the past minute we're told me I can never vote for her\n[noise] yeah I'm ... and that is why yeah that are by the name I mean that's it's a consummate right oh yeah\nRight it's Europe hailing the former vice presidential nominee and also the former governor of the great state of Alaska jury in the moment I have left I I Would be remiss if I didn't go back to how you and your family were treated by the media when you were announced it and I imagine that some days in my life\nThat were really great also tell my family I just succeeded in doing something I could imagine when you told John McCain want you to be the vice presidential nominee almost like Brett Kavanaugh being told\nDonald Trump want you to be on the Supreme Court has got to be jubilation it's gotta be unbelievable Julian and high fives and belly bumps and and much left and then all of a sudden the media says we're going to get her mission to do\nTo begin with Kevin Oh can you relate to what are you must have gone through in the past ...\nYeah absolutely and you're right um you know the Obama administration and the media they sent up dozens and dozens and dozens and we're at right here where I'm standing right now in my yard literally in the yard to find anything but um yeah I could relate the thing that I disagree with judge Kavanaugh on is a he has\nProclamation that it has devastated or or destroyed the family no it doesn't destroy your family your circle the wagons it it actually um you can be used as you can get out there all that that um the marking that lies told about you\nKnow and really use it at empathy for other people who go through a bunch of crap in this world because everybody does\nUm use that to power you to get out there and do the right thing and fight really really hard for the underdog like really hard for those who don't have that platform that microphone to speak up for justice\nIt's Europe last question that you show us for doing this but I just have to do as you see the left becoming even more on when you hit the national spotlight it was ... years ago now\nI'm ... and it was unusual ready but now it's ridiculous to what people literally scratching of Supreme Court door as you did you get in and stop him from being ... they don't completely ...\nHow do you counter balance that and how do we get the Bush's 'cause I think the majority of America on like\nHow do we get the boy she's a normal people among us to to rise to the top again or is that these are really hard because the media is showing joined the ratings are getting from showing these huge\nWell yeah I I mean there's a triple threat against us that the media the opposing party and then rhinos within our own party run letting this happen like that so\nUh you know it's free against one but no we already made manifest I think our need for a change in the system and um the corruption in that lack of accountability in twenty sixteen when what can\nWe talk about the man as a person but that Trump movement where the people stood up and said enough is enough rascal gotta go will make a difference but it's funny a couple of my girlfriends and I were texting the last couple of days during the the Kavanaugh discussions going\nOn in our little group of girlfriends out there that we would like these radical [laughter] you know we're getting I haven't gone I\nThink that's a fact that you know the more they become unhinged I I think the more that I'm reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we said not enough is enough of that and um we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitutions all about\nLimiting government that we can govern ourselves and I know I think people like you who have the guts to be out there every day in the arena making a difference where do you guys so people\nWere going to do that is there a ... million along with millions of other Americans voted for you to vote for you know again I really appreciate you reached out thanks for taking the time today\nThank you so much appreciate you\nBetter do this with Joe ... generator [noise]\nHis show [noise]\nTalking about the stories Joe bags news talk Ninety
