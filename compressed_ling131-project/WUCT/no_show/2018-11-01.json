I might actually send more people to the border than I thought I was going\nFrom Reuters US President Donald Trump that on Wednesday the United states could than has many at Fifteen thousand troops to the border with Mexico and how the stance against the caravan of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America\nAs far as the caravan is concerned our military is out will go up to anywhere between ten and Fifteen thousand military personnel on top of border patrol ice and everybody else to the border Trump told reporters at the White House and the Trump administrator on Monday but the number of troops that aimed at the end of the border and over fifty two hundred\nAnd that's not to use integration as an issue to motivate Republican voters ahead of the November ... elections next week or Republicans will seek to maintain control on those congressional chambers\nAnd the presidential candidate before the U.S election in two thousand sixteen Trump promised to harden immigration laws and build a wall along the southern border with Mexico but implementation of this thing that your campaign promise has been slow\nA caravan of Central American migrants estimated to number at least thirty five hundred people left Honduras and then I Tobar and is now in southern Mexico on its way into the U.S border\nDid you want to tell people what you would you wrote me on the Facebook [laughter] this little and joke\nBecause Louis and people have to understand that you are not as nice as your pretend on the radio on that\nIn that town I Am I just think that gave me a hard time every once\nIn awhile hey let's talk more about the fourteenth amendment please pretty pleased that from Kerry ... veterans Gary Locke is about and then for you and your response there is no some of the hill and what you told me and my response was that's not nice don't bully [laughter] here it's fun to a shot at\nBy it but it just it was it because I wasn't gonna recall you would imagine story they care that they\nAre so so there you go ah the president might be sending a whole lot more troops there and and again we should have a show of force on the border we should let people know who are who are wannabe invaders\nThat we're not going to just stand by allowed to happen no matter how solved the left once the the border to be no matter how you know a ... or more compassionate we have to accept them they need a I saw somebody say that today on one of between so I sent out and my answer was how many of these people are you going to walk them into your home\nHow many\nBecause listen there are people in need in this country we should take care of her own first but here's a quick question it was a guy at the corner where I turn on the left to go to my gym every day and the guy standing there he told him to sign\nI'm a help or whatever you can do\n\nI got the list of issues why he has to stay on the corner instead of going to the McDonald's across the street and ask to to get a job at minimum\nDo these dating there all the time he walked back and forth the looks your idea I Want some money means let me ask you one of these liberals these bleeding heart to say we're not compassionate of will accept everybody who's breaking for the border\nWill you take that guy from the corner better question if that guy comes to your house\nPushes his way into the door\nGrabs some food out of your refrigerator makes themselves from coffee it puts on his favorite TV show is he sits on your couch are you going to say well I have to do it I have more than he does I'm compassionate he deserves my stuff I have too much stuff and he has no stuff and he just wants a better life\nI'm guessing nobody on either side another right so I wouldn't say that's okay but even those in the left wouldn't say that's okay\nWhat do you see far left is like Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook building a six foot wall around who's estate in Hawaii it makes you say to yourself or that they were for a while but they were they weren't for enforcement at the border\nWhen you see people living in in gated communities which is fine build a wall and blaming the gated community just there'll be a hypocrite when you talk about you know what it is that's going on\nYou know when you see the Obamas they're six or eight million dollar house in the DC area that's surrounded by you know security and they've got you know Secret Service all the time they're not accepting any of these caravan people Bennett accepting the homeless people in in Washington DC to come and take their stuff because they have too much\nWater that compassionate knocking passionate\nWhy not why not just allow them to have your stuff\nIf you're a liberal and you're a bleeding heart and you say open borders and we stole half of Mexico like Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke says\nTell everybody in the caravan to come and stay with you I saw this Mimi carry that if I was actually pretty appropriate mhm\nIt was I think it was an open letter to to those and the caravan there are plenty of people in the United states would like to help you you can find them by looking for the ... science in the front yard\nHow would that be something at when you're stuck on the door I see the bait them they design them [laughter] I think that would\nBe all areas because they're oval a crap as what they are they're ... they don't want visiting their house they just want to say as a society we should have or are you going to put them\nPut them in your guest room I'd area it's eight at eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com I'm going to be Emma Michelle from campus reform that old when we come back on Halloween and PC keeping writer\nHere listening to kill wrong [noise]\nWe're not going to go after students who break the rules so they admit that it's ridiculous and that it can't be enforced because it's not doing anything wrong frankly\nUh so it's it just shows how the left is basically creating problems so that they can be that wants to offer this illusion\nThat they're trying to um shamed people to not being a Mexican taco which just shows by the I'm In San Antonio Texas should be ... percent Hispanic mainly Mexican and ethnicity and of course taco should measure to you know if either one of the radio or television showed\nTacos are not Mexican I Would be in trouble you realize oh ... so let's just dumb or it's it's ... to their much talk about what ... who's doing at Michigan State them will flow chart what is Princeton doing\nPrinceton has actually released from the student government a checklist for a safe and inclusive Halloween and some of the questions that an ass on there are pretty ridiculous an obvious things I'm One of them talks about how if you're wearing a costume that makes a joke out of a cultural group then you are racist and you\nShouldn't be wearing costume and it's actually unsafe unsafe by the school and I don't think it's so much the fact that they're saying hey be careful what you're wearing be careful about to wear this costs down I guess the fact that they're actually releasing a checklist so these are Princeton students we can assume that they're pretty smart students generally um uh well\nWe can argue that well good I've been talking for a long time Princeton has gone down a few rooms in my in my book the dead\nIt's an Ivy League school so it can at least assume that there is some degree of smart and these students we should at least be able to assume that there is something there it is and yet the school is coming out with these checklist telling students\nHey make sure that you do X Y Z before he aware hollowing costume which in general is supposed to be something that's fun and lighthearted joke itself so\nI think they're turning things way too serious way too easily and it's pretty unfortunate to see because Halloween is fun it's a fun holiday a students should be allowed the students and you know frankly the schools are not giving them the liberty to do that\nIt's ... am on me show you a bitch at you and then I underscore the ... or ... that we deal a guy do ... or ... or ... what your problem is and and to write this problem to have\nTheir smart people they had to really work to Russia's old academically to get into Princeton and then the the the the administration the faculty whomever at Princeton showed you show stupid\nBut yeah I mean essentially the school is saying hey I Know you work super hard to get here I Know you did well on your SAT's you wrote a really impressive admissions essay but just so you know we don't trust you to wear inappropriate Halloween costumes and I think it\nAs an adult you should be able to make those decisions yourself and if you choose to wear something stupid you will you know you'll be the one to ... percent of those social repercussions yeah I don't think it's the school's job to be police\nThing that and ultimately schools are there to educate students they're there to teach them skills for the workforce I think policing what's going on on Halloween outside of the classroom is really just not what they should be in the business of doing\nCould not agree with you move to give them that every day what do I do which I Am on the show we went from Michigan to ah to New Jersey and that was due to Utah um what what is the University of Utah do we use it is different than what we heard Joe for\nSlightly but it really fits into the same larger pattern here at the University of Utah held event called my culture is not your costs down which is fair enough but I Would think most students could be able to tell the difference between a culture and the cost and when I don't think it's\nThat crazy up a distinction to know already or to try to make so the ah the school is holding these events and actually\nAs a follow up to the event it released a new term which is\nDifferent from cultural appropriation which is the one that we always hear like we've heard it a million times at this point they actually coined a new term which is cultural co optician ocean which essentially seems to me the same thing to do that to keep Iran they keep reinventing the PC will where they're saying\nCultural cooperation is when you take something from another culture and you only take that one thing without taking the whole context\nSo the example that they use is a girl who dresses as an Indian per Halloween because he thinks that\nLook cool you know they call that cultural ...\nSo story time for you when I was a kid I dress up as Sacramento after Halloween so I Know I Would be in big trouble if I did that now but as a kid she's an American hero she ... Lewis and Clark\nOr when they were on the trail she help them with navigation finding food she helped them stay alive and I'm from Oregon our state may not exist if it weren't for her so she's she's still the hero where I'm from all my friends loved it my teachers loved it if I were that same costume for the same reason on the college campus today I Would be you were by the left\nFor cultural collapse station or whatever it is they're calling it now it's pretty fortunate see because they do think there are people that Jenny only want to honor other cultures but they're not allowed to do that without being called a racist or without someone screaming cultural appropriation so pretty fortunate the scene because it gets to a point where\nYou are being put into a box and you cannot take things from other cultures outside of your own apartment where\nWould you interesting to me is that the way that it was worded was just for a call ... not that that's really a word but it is that\nIf you don't do it in context shoulders with me if I decided I'm going to be whatever chief you know shooting ban would ever to Halloween do I have to have\nReal a Native American or American indian family members around me the image and contacts that I can get away with it what do you even know what that means that it has to be context notice how do you put it in context being ...\nWhat's funny is they don't get very much contacts were claiming that you need to have contacts so I can only assume Joe that they would expect you to bulldoze your house and put up a TV and if you wanted to be sitting bull or you know if I wanted to be second you're way I Would have to walk to work every day instead of driving my car\nUm I I don't really understand why they want a new doing that but yeah\nIt's it's really don't bother you that you have a hard time explaining unexplainable would they would what happens on the left is they put as many words as we possibly can America and Obama was really good at that you'd be asked the question at a at a town hall or in a press coverage it would give us twenty seven hundred\nNothing but ... to the point to get away with your ... she's the Brooklyn Bridge over it gives people will do that which I Dream about a minute if you don't mind him on on on ... notes and asking people in college campuses uh about the caravan and what's your thoughts are on the German\nLeadership Institute campus reform part of what we do is we send our speakers to college campuses to engage with students and we send them out to make these videos and gauge what the student opinion is on current issues and it's impossible to ignore one of the biggest issue as recently as a caravan that locked up\nAnd that's coming up through Mexico right now to walk on Mexico\nOn it's pretty interesting to see what students think about that because they say there was one girl that said yeah I\nThink we should let them all in and he said OK well\nIs there anyone we shouldn't let in and she goes oh I don't know maybe Nazis and he's like okay well well how how would we determined that she goes well I don't know maybe it's just\nA risk that will have to take a while I think I think students really don't understand also who's in charge of immigration I'm Congress is in charge of immigration policy this is not something that Donald Trump should\nReally be blamed for um they they really keep going after the executive branch here they they have all these issues with ice\nIce doesn't make the rules their job is just to enforce them right it would be like going after your local police for enforcing the laws that your local legislators have put into place so I think it's pretty it's thank you I think it's pretty ridiculous to the college students\nUm blaming one person or one administration for these problems that have been rooted for so long in Congress this is a solution that Congress needs to come up with and I think it's really disappointing to see that college students really there's just a lack of understanding\nThe Detroit on professors to be honest with you but there's the appropriate or either feeding her head tradition documented crab or they're not teaching them you know what's going on they don't you begin to understand ... ... weird it\nIt's very true there's a lot of students that never actually have to take an American history course we covered awhile back George, Washington university for history majors no longer required American history for those students who are majoring in history so it's pretty dismayed to see I think it's really important for\nNothing and Ken and just as a good citizen to understand the way our country works so that when you are dissatisfied with their government you know the best course of action to take and I think that most Republicans are pretty well informed on whereas most Democrats or not and it's it's upsetting because\nWe see these Democrats students and he's really liberal ... left his students they when they don't think they kind of tend to protest they\nHave a mob whereas you know the more conservative students libertarian students they just go to vote so I think we're going to see that a lot in midterms coming up here and just about a week um we're going to see what the turnout is there and we're going to see what ends up happening but I think it just comes down to what do you do when you're dissatisfied and it seems like conservatives really seem to have their head screwed on straight or about that\nBut actually write a ... at ... am

Gordon Chang of the Daily Beast [noise]\nThere was a front page piece in the New York times about a report that up to one million weaker as those are the ... people's\nOf ... province in China east Turk establish a separate republic conquered by the Maoists in the late Nineteen forties up to one million weaker or\nWorship for Muslims have been detained in ... in concentration camps one million one million\nThe Chinese authorities the PR the the ... is that Xi Jinping and his gang deny\nHappening you you've been misinformed well that changed\nThey no longer did not [noise] they're what they're saying is worse so we're going to Nouri Terkel former president of the week or American Association to help us understand what the latest from the PR see about their aggression what's the latest explanation is\nNormally a very good evening to you okay they now admit that it exists and that the reporting is accurate\nYou have been with us for many years talking about the persecution of the week goes by the Chinese authorities the bullies who claim that the weaker is attacked them with knives so they gunned down five or ten or Fifteen people\nAnd execute the survivors immediately that was that this is now what is the latest explanations for up to one million people detained against their will\nThat mean John thank you for having me on your show again uh\nThe the Chinese government has been a trying to come up as a a a Congress strategy to a quote unquote trying to explain to the world why do they have to uh uh engaged and twenty first century and not the style concentration camps so uh\nAnd the un ah handled a call them out in August\nThe Chinese government has a big trying so hard\nAnd the different ways uh through their own publication and ... materials to\nA one normalize quote unquote and then to legalize their um mass detention and criminalization of the week of people based on their ethnicity and religious practices now let's look at the Chinese government's motive where the narrative is pretty clear\nAh their actions have been at widely reported\nA so they took out there a load of their number one motive for the Chinese government or in other words unstated goal is to achieve the China Dream the belt and road initiative\nHas on Robert Kaplan pointed out in his an essay on the wall Street Journal the east took his time there's a big chunk of land that can either at makes the Chinese allowed the Chinese to get access to your Asia or block the raging access\nSo the Chinese government wanted to completely et took control over not only the territory the properties of the week with people but also the livelihoods of the uh the livelihood\nIncluding the other tricky people and then the to the Chinese government wanted to avoid a by you know their self fulfilling prophecy that they have created\nThat um the rigors at the ... national identity eventually will be a potential for them so it is it is truly a fantasy that they have a a a have been reactive through a brutal policies and then the third\nTo China's government has been very racist or this whole thing as a racist character\nThe reason that a sleeve and and this has been said many or a China scholars we're experts that no government uh in the twenty first century would call somebody's ethnic ideology as the or as a a a cancerous tumor\nAnd no government around the world called Islam as a mental disease\nAnd also the Chinese government uh\nHave a trouble to understand that their way of life to hunt Chinese people way of life\nTheir culture the language they called ah the truck Princeton life is not something universal and and they shouldn't be a imposed on people like to send a week or so and oftentimes the Chinese government um\nAbout security social stability but you don't walk up forty eight a well known academics\nSoccer player religious figures business leaders\nFlying through a pet musician ... could claim that you're fighting again separate there's number three evil forces it does it you know make no sense at all\nSo the Chinese government said this is about security but when you carefully that men their policy their behaviors or it it clearly said just\n... this is all about you think this is all about Communist Party this is all about China's a struggle to dominate the world and this is all about imposing Chinese language Chinese culture by for if you don't accept\nWill pick you up and in addition to what we have been covered some heartbreaking heart wrenching stories had been told recently\nA scholar based in Seattle wrote a if a published and as long as the ... investigative report on foreign policy in China file\nThat basically suggest that one million out one million in one million up me is that China has gotten locked up a certain age group ninth or the individuals born in Nineteen eighty and Ninety Ninety and intellectual and all other elite from the society\nAnd then they fall in those homes those bedrooms those dining tables where Chinese cut great at what they're coming into the legal like so even if it if it is a dreadful situation that we're like spirit that we go home town\nWhere you go to a town city like a ghost town the day we could businesses that been have been bankrupt because the owners have locked up\nSo I been there to clear it is time for action Gordon thank God that the United states government has been very outspoken Trump administrations because they're outspoken and they have some congressional leaders which is Marco Rubio and Christopher Smith already be in the process that interview thing at legislation\nI Wonder if I Want I Want to garden I'm One quarter to enter here Gordon is is this story challenge used to challenge Xi Jinping routinely\n[noise] well no unfortunately not inside China but that's just not possible but outside China yes of course it is because this is a crime against humanity and something's got to be done about it the officials who are responsible for this need to be sanctioned and that includes ... himself\nSo when ... Xi Jinping or his lieutenant show up at international bodies to talk about global warming or some other utopian version of their reality they they can be challenged by a the United states and its allies\nAbsolutely especially those who are in the chain of command been these camps all the way up to ...\n... the former president of the week or American Association he speaks very carefully up the

stronger the job opportunities you can leave your job and get a better job\nDoes that get to the polls you think it does so why but these ... ... scientists are telling us it's not it's a non starter because the Democrats so villain ours Donald Trump people are going to forget why their money in their book\nYeah I I think that analysis is incorrect that people are so you know are so angry I mean certainly there is a segment of the population that is I agree a trumpet hate his guts and are motivated to vote for Democrats simply out of that [noise]\nI also wish that the Republicans that made the economic messaging more front and center going into next Tuesday they haven't made some candidates have by and large as a national\nThe source of great frustration for me but I also think that the American people a lot smarter\nThan than depressed give them credit for they do see they're stronger paychecks they see the wage growth they see their job opportunities I think they see greater prosperity in every direction a stronger economy and international position for the country\nYou know who's responsible for that the president and the Republicans and they're likely to reward them I really believe that that is true and as far as vilify Donald Trump I think we're in a whip around situation\nWhere they have done it so often and for so long that people have now tuned it out and they are likely to act in the opposite direction\nThe production by Nancy Pelosi said she will be the speaker of the house again she guarantees on the Tonight Show out those are they on the Tonight Show without laughing that what we need is a leader who doesn't divided to bring us together she does is without laughing however political science says that there's merits of Mrs pillows these prediction\nThat the how swings to Nancy Pelosi if that\nHappens Monica the worst case scenario is that the house is ... they promised investigations that guaranteed investigation subpoena power in all directions do you believe those investigations will sway the American people to a turning against the men they voted in the end of the office\nNo in fact I think it will have the exact opposite effect the way the Republican investigations into Bill Clinton in the Nineteen nineties had the opposite effect on\nPeople rally around the president even one is polarizing is this one he is still the president of the United states Bill Clinton same thing and the other thing that the two presidents have in common is a stronger economy\nPresiding they both are presiding over big strong economy whether it was in the Nineteen nineties or today and a strong economy a knock elites presidents from a lot of nonsense a lot of investigations and a lot of ... because people are willing to overlook that when things are good for them and their families\nSo I think you know if we get a Democratic House yeah in my view this will be terrible we will have paralysis but I also think that Donald Trump is never as good as he is when he's got a foil no better foil for Donald Trump that Nancy Pelosi a Democratic House which is\nOverreaching every day with impeachment investigations and the rest\nTo it's likely if that were to happen Trump runs against them for the next two years gets reelected and flip to the house back\nThe Senate or the Senate is looking very favorable for the Republicans it's a good map out possible pickup up too but I Want to concentrate in New Jersey you're a Jersey Girl Monica\nI'm Robert Menendez is a deeply troubled candidate all we know about the investigations are we also know that the uh papers in New Jersey have acknowledge that there is married to those investigations and are recommending in a blue state that people hold their nose and vote for him and then\nI'm told that late in the game the national Democrats panic a little bit because they saw him and then does his numbers were weak and they poured three million dollars then to elect him what is your sense Monica will will the liberals of New Jersey vote for a man who has such and such baggage\nYou know I grew up in New Jersey John I Love the Garden State and my mother is still there almost

Gordon the Chinese side of the story has lots of millions of people at risk here\nFor a weakening economy in China because of the tariffs maybe tens of millions of people do they have a voice Gordon and the way our manufacturing base has a voice and is a very loud voice these days of the Trump Administration do the Chinese manufacturers have a voice in Beijing\nWas a great question John and you know in the Chinese system um it is a complex series of bargaining among coalitions groups factions\nAnd political leaders so they do have a voice but it's very different from the voice that we have in our political system which is direct because as you pointed out we've got mid term elections we've got of course presidential elections\nThey don't really have that but it does mean teaching paying faces almost an election every day and that's a very different dynamic of course\nThe report from China and these last hours and in these last days is that the the purchasing managers index which Gordon is taught me to pay much attention to\nIs at fifty point too which is lower than the expected fifty point six and a Reuters poll down from fifty point eight in September whatever means it's weaker than it was so we welcome our colleague Andrew Collier\nHe is in Hong Kong and he watches the Chinese economy extremely carefully [noise]\nUh Andrew a very good morning to you and Hong Kong these purchasing managers index is a confused me and there's another headline saying the site chicken ...

Modi they are two parts of what is called the Indo Pacific Claude India Japan Australia and the United states all day and and Modi both share democracies are they both have aggressive modern warships what are they\nEach other and how does how do they regard China collectively good evening to\nGood evening John and Gordon and to your listeners around the world John and very happy Halloween to all of you um you know it's a good good point John the or the Japanese and the Indians share both a common values\nAnd also a common threat perception there is a view that is very widely held in both Tokyo and in India\nAh that China's aggressive build up its military capabilities and its use of both military\nAnd economic tools as well as its diplomacy are coming at these countries expense including the region in a bit of a danger where uh it's possible Beijing may use coercion and unto on toward influenced to try to put these countries\nNational security at risk so you saw the prime minister of Japan visit Beijing where he and Xi Jinping met late last week\nThe very next day he was back in Tokyo and met with prime minister Modi at the foot of mount Fuji where he invited him to his private residence and signed a host of deals and announced a number of other initiatives all designed to signal a very strong bilateral relationship between Tokyo in New Delhi Gordon\nScott you mentioned that a prime minister of being hosted the Indian prime minister at his private home in\nAt the base of mount Fuji um what struck me about all this is the uh when I went to Beijing did it just seemed a little bit stiff of the meeting city had in the Chinese capital\nBut to his relations with Modi were very warm and and this strikes me is is not just a personal relationship but as you point out\nI'm In Japan and India seeing a common interest um if you could talk a little bit about the the warmth of the relationships that has had with ... and the significance of going forward\nYeah I think there's no doubt you know the\nThe Japanese generally and the prime minister in particular do feel a a a very strong sense of shared identity as a democratic country and Asian democracy that has legitimately embraced and built its own version of democracy\nOr and and that shows through in the personal relations between\nThe prime minister and his Indian counterpart but also between other Japanese officials and their Indian counterparts what's not oversell this working with India is still recognized in Japan to the work in progress very promising but it has been very promising for a long time so it is not always easy and as you've seen\nThey have been negotiating arms sales and other types of a defense cooperation\nFor quite a number of years it's not necessarily the case that this confluence of interest in threat perceptions immediate you lead your results that might hope\nBut there is a great sense of optimism that at least the direction is the right one and that they can build a closer relationship by contrast the Japanese recognize\nThat China's in a very difficult place right now I Believe your previous guest just outlined some of the economic difficulties China's facing you're also of course facing a difficult relationship with\nThe American administration and the election in Brazil is likely to put even further pressure on Beijing such Japan recognizes that China's outreach now is almost entirely tactical it's an attempt to alleviate pressure on Beijing\nNot genuinely motivated by any change in thinking of by Beijing about the grand strategic relationship it wants to have with Japan\nAnd similarly the Japanese recognize that and say okay we'd be happy to work more closely with you on terms that we can accept but we're not going to wreck we're not going to believe that this represents any kind of a sea change\nSome place where they were in the two sides were in over the last several years\nScott were told there is a cause the Indo Pacific region Claude India Australia and Japan and the United states is that aspirational or is that actual\nBut I think it's a great question John you know I I Do think that this was an aspirational about a dozen years ago at that time a there is the four side there was not entirely\nA confluence of uh of belief that China posed a challenge or a threat today I think that is much more strongly recognized and held his view and all four capitals I Will say though that uh there continues to be\nA need to build a practical need around the bones of the quandary lateral dialogue and grouping\nOf course do do some military exchanges of exercises and in fact the recent visit by the Indian prime minister to to pan has led to an upgrading in India Japan defense ties with\nMore regular rise high level contacts including a two plus two dialogue but firmly been announced where the Japanese and Indian foreign and defense ministers will meet and the two sides will work more closely to invest in\nCapabilities that are dual use including a code developing a artificial intelligence and robotics and working more closely or in the mail mail exchanges but to be sure there is much much work left to do and it would be premature to say that the ... has reached its full potential Gordon\nScott you know I listen to you describe the relationship between Japan and India one can say many of the same things between India and the United states it's a great relationship but it's got a long long way to go I mean do you see any parallels there\nOh absolutely I mean I think that the reality with India is it is a country with enormous potential\nUh and unfortunately also enormous obstacles to realizing the full measure of that potential\nUh India continues to have a large amount of attachment to its previous or and continues to have a non aligned policy or a policy that cherishes autonomy and devoid of any kind of a formal alliance relationship with any other country\nThat is in some ways quite limiting of course India also has a large number of captured or vested interests in its\nDefense industrial base as well as the broader economy that kind of complicate\nBlock or at least make difficult any sort of a deepening of a really meaningful deepening of economic ties including defense industrial ties so I Do think there are a lot of parallels I think that the good thing here is that the U.S and Japan is very close allies are working very closely to try to encourage the Indians\nTo find ways to work within their system to try to put pressure\nOr from the outside welcome pressure pressure that new tally can used to say look we want to do this with the Americans and the Japanese and in order to cooperate more deeply we need to make some changes domestically\nIn the Japanese context as you know Gordon this used to be referred to and is still referred to as ... or you full foreign pressure that kind of pressure can help India to\nMake forward progress on kind of breaking up some of the cartel like structures and its domestic economy and opening it up so that they can capture some of the real dynamism that exist in India is highly educated extremely skilled

is about with the Koch brothers and Paul Ryan and some of the Republican elites and you if you object to things like this birthright citizenship here's Carlson\nObviously and some people say when they

you can help me out a series make a film about that\nWould really be about people coming here illegally or would it be\nThat still the south well up until civil rights acts and things of that nature Jim Crow laws but this was even worse okay the states will determine who's a citizen were not ever going to say these people are citizens that's what this was put in to do not\nSet up a mirror mama I'm era mom can you imagine\nHaving New Jersey not see that until n J TV because it's going on over the place they don't care maybe they even support it why would we do that just think of how
