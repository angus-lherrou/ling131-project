nothing but but false foods\nAre so we break that down weeks but we're also talking about his take on the whole cabinet debacle and the hearings that will just ridiculous made the Senate with like a

Cline it was crazy by she'll agreed\n[noise] and it was actually a normal sparkly that did that I think they see low of course the lead singer for knows Berkeley so I'm so maybe\nI mean I I got a couple of options now maybe do that I'm not going to do so it'd be forty five to stay in a lot that's not going to happen so we've got the more you're also the website click on Instagram a lot of people a lot of positive comments on how you look on the camera today\nReally that they think you look great ...\nYou go ... and of course there's always one person over on Facebook Celeste says nothing\nCan honor and campaign on her so I appreciate that\nAnd my answer to ... days never\nShed less than ever going to happen that's not going to happen in ... so we've got that for you which is always nice as well plus or as you there I Lived tweet during the program or if you're wondering what the hell is it easier to give it to get a hold of you you either you know sent me an email or I live to eat during the program and I\nI tend to be on the Twitter is if I'm awake I'm On the twitters but somebody has to be on the Twitter all tend to see it\nUm if if you know the Instagram is where you go over you go see the picture of carrion polo\nAnd the new studio carry an eye yesterday or carry and me\nYesterday on a screen shot from Newsmax had a big hurdle allow me to post a picture in ... living there to unite real an eleven thirty like midnight it was like two thirty in the morning but right now and now so yeah go check that out all the social media is right there plus or you'll see the news stories that we're talking about right in the right hand side as well\n... let me go to the phone lines on a voter ID A lot of people have a lot to say about it it's going to be a Sheryl in line to I sure what's going on\nRight now I've been here every day like Helen from\nOr I Do not blame you thank you [laughter] and then when I got\nMy registration and then we had to lay out ... and they sent hard that had your name and your\nVoter id now yeah and you can get pretty dang a newer trade card game and then you can go right now or in it and it's All right now\nYou can only vote by mail and Oregon yeah you don't actually go to you don't go to a polling place all no come on man it right now well then how do you know who's who exactly\n... and by the way the registration card ... ended up itself wasn't enough either if I lose my wife ... if I lose my wallet and my voter registration card is in there somebody\nThose votes them by name and doesn't have to show ID they get to do that but I Would be disenfranchised that's why the photo ID actually protects all Americans so that their franchises and taken away\nExactly\nSo who's smart idea was to have vote by mail only\nI had no idea that they changed it over and they send your ballot in the mail you mark hey you want to vote for you to sign the envelope ticket in another envelope and mail it in\nMy ... if I'm gonna have to start a new segment am I gonna hold on a second\nWe can do that\nAnd really there are a lot in Oregon that wrong\nAnd what's interesting is there a lot of great Americans like you that live there and then you have ...\nYou know what I mean it's it's like the state would be read except you've got a couple of concentrations of people who just don't seem to get the American way and then the rest of you have to suffer we love being on an Oregon but we've got like five stations in Oregon now and we love the open line now at eight eight nine four one pegs\nEditing nine for one Seventy two four seven let me quickly grab Lisa in Tennessee leads to make it fast for me which I have a\n[laughter] okay well um well they were saying that it was unfair to um blacks and Hispanics and the elderly and young people\nTo have to have 'em and I pay you know state id right but part of the reason why they were saying that is because they said that they couldn't afford it but they also didn't have transportation to get there to get the I write\nSo I don't understand how that's an argument because if they don't have transportation to go and get the I Do how do they transportation to go and vote\nBut it's a great question and also to add on top of that I'm Sorry but old people young people Hispanics blacks in American Indians are all able to go and buy Sudafed you've got to show a photo ID to do that open a checking account have to have photo ID to do that\nI mean you can't you can't go and watch it Eric Holder speak without showing photo ID so that the whole thing is a ruse\nAnd what bothers me the most out of all of it is that so many drones and lemmings on the left will sit back and allow the leadership of that move\nOf the progressive left in this country to actually look at them and say you're black so you're stupid you're Hispanic so you're stupid you're you're an American Indian so you're stupid you're younger you're old so you're stupid and you can't go and get an ID I happen to believe and in my way of thinking is mental you're smart enough\nBut you're way way smarter than your own party is due to credit for\nCome back with Ron Johnson the senator from Wisconsin [noise]\nYou're listening to the gym [noise]\nThey've had this primal screams since the day after the election when the wrong person corner them one you know I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous insecure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican a great deal of Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Garrett correct you supported the president as that all Republicans\nAnd has been all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and and this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helps people\nOf the major amount of people that were paying that find that tax would be an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it\nA political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nFirst of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you like health care plan and keep your families who have their previous reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live a year\nOr they they are pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that\nAllow companies to offer Reno ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates in Wisconsin for example he health estimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her vomit care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year or they could get an insurance plan\nGetting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter of the current levels\nIf ... and so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guarantee remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if he can afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you said it's not going to go and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation preexisting conditions aren't touched nobody's\nSaying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that former senator if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection in terms of pre existing conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the Han care exchanges\nWe're giving them an option debate apt to be able to afford health insurance for once\nOkay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because we're on day one single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if a if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects aren't preexisting condition which new Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nOr they think they can win the election but no I mean there are long term goal obviously is Bernie Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts a tour his single payer government run bureaucratic system\nThat will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business taxes at least double in the state wouldn't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching the right down the number thirty two trillion then realized how much money that as a Senator Ron Johnson one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime I friend\nUm when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned briefly\nI feel strongly that ... well the Senate stay with you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly but the houses are starting to look like it's up for grabs were this blue wave was being talked about for six months do you think that the moves by Avon audience Feinstein and\nAnd uh and Cory Booker Spartacus and all these people in that process\nWhere do you think that's going to motivate conservatives and Republicans to get up off their hands and go and vote November\nI sure hope so I I don't know ... what else what else can Democrats show the American public to just create the discussed again if you're not disgusted by their despicable ... behavior God help you\nKnow I'm I'm with you and I think that it's going to be probably I'm hearing people saying red dawn\nOn on on November ah six I'm not really sure what's going to happen other than people need to go and vote or else it surely will be some sort of a strange blue wave of impeachment talking all this other garbage Ron ... million for the time I always appreciate the knowledge and thank

time you looked upon it as a sign that the standing committee and the president for life Xi Jinping had made a decision what kind of decision\nWill certainly the Chinese have decided to try to push the U.S out of the south China Sea and its other peripheral waters\nAnd over a course of years we've seen some very dangerous encounters not only with warships but also with the navy and air force planes in international airspace\nOr the Decatur incident was unusually aggressive because of the Chinese warship across the bow of the Decatur and came within forty five yards when it did so that's just seconds away from a collusion and that could have been catastrophe\nWe welcome to voices who help us will help us understand these unusual occurrences that are happening in China and in Hong Kong and\nOn the high seas South China sea first of all returning to us after some weeks mock Clifford is here in Studio he's the former editor in chief of the south China Morning post and a resident in Hong Kong since\nNineteen Ninety to mark a very good evening to you and thank you for joining us thank you John nice to be back in addition we ... we are very lucky to have the candidates for a masters in higher education see holding Kim he's at the University of Rochester to join us tonight to talk about\nUm irregularities on college campuses Gordon is that a general enough way to put\nA certain way we're going to look at an incident that occurred in March and talk a little bit about Chinese influence on American campuses and what American administrators are doing is they react to what they perceived to be um Beijing's wishes we\nHowever with mark Clifford because of incidents that have happened in these last days since to cater a won the Interpol chat\nFor [noise]\n\nI'm John bachelor Gordon Chang my colleague and co host and we are very pleased in the studio to have with us mark Clifford the former editor of the south China Morning post he's a resident of Hong Kong and he's traveled here to New York to sit with us\nAs well as the whole Kim has a master's candidate\nIn the program for higher education at the University of Rochester but also as an observer of influenced by the Chinese authorities and their Kendrick of Cain Gordon\nSo you're a graduate student University of Rochester in March you we're organizing an event on campus who was the event for\nSo the event was pretty much for everybody and the university was an open event where everyone can come without paying a fee and it was meant to sort of um spread this idea of dialogue on campus\nAnd dialogue with whom I mean who who are the people are going to be at the event\nSo I'm as I said before you do it although was open for everybody I wanted to use I wanted to purposely use the Tibetan issue as an example because of the fact that the Tibetan issue mainly focuses on having dialogue with those that you tend to disagree with\nAnd so I'm by by setting that by sending that issue and talking about it on campus we want to give a everybody a chance\nOf course being on a college campus we do have a lot of an international Chinese students so want to give them a choice I'd give them an opportunity also too you know I could get to know the Tibetan issue I'm ...\nAnd then find out it's an issue to bet I'm Beijing believes is a part of the People's Republic of China and sits in the south western portion\nVery strategic because many of the world's a river start their high ground 'em and Tibetans they don't necessarily agree that they are part of the People's Republic some of them do but some of them want independence\nActs at least since two thousand eight the Chinese authorities have used brutality against the people of Tibet we have reports of internal migration forced internal migration ethnic cleansing that can be called\nNot only in Tibet but in large cities to the edges of the Tibetan Plateau that's what you were introducing people to the facts that we have about uh the persecution\nHis holiness the dollar ... the spiritual leader of the Tibetans um has taken the position that he doesn't want independence that Tibet should be autonomous\nAnd who's complained of what he's called and what many people agree is cultural genocide the purposeful attempt by Beijing to eliminate Tibetan Buddhism to eliminate Tibetan the density 'em to take over the lands of Tibet so this is controversial with regard to both trying to run and\nAmerican campus what happened well\nI you know it's it's not a I I think it's more it's bigger than being an American campus at this point because you know my primary goal was to live out this whole principle that you know we can talk about any issues as a student and we can\nCome come to come to the mutual ground and and just simply and simply sit down and agree to disagree or or to agree to agree\nAnd et cetera et cetera um I purposely used it to an issue in order to give a an opportunity for every student to observe it and make an opinion of their own and then have a dialogue amongst themselves\nThere by living out the principles of what it needs to be at a at a college campus especially in the United states of America\nAnd in March you would actually organized this event it was advertised it was actually the University of Florida's new about it because of course it was taking place on the campus of the University of Rochester and you had a very good central location on campus who did what happened immediately before there\nSo I'm up until I guess a day before the event I'm even a even a little bit before that everything was uh going as planned um I was told that the hosting student organization\nI'm even had a meeting about the event and they've even decided not only to host event for me but to help me register for the event I I I went through every every guideline that their advice or had told me to follow and\nSuddenly um my ... so my event was set on the thirty first of march and undone night or the twenty ninth\nMy a friend of mine actually sent me a screen shot of an email that they receive from the Chinese student association saying that um you know apparently the Chinese student association has had received ... concerns from uh some of the members of the Chinese a international student community\nAnd that are about my event going on on campus and they will and it said on the email that they will lead they ... at both the university and the student administration or know about this\nNow a few friends of mine actually called me that night and asked me you know ah we're actually fearful that your event might be canceled or something where it's my ...\nThis is the United states what could happen you know it's I I'm entitled to my free speech as a scholar\nUm ... it just as they are they're free to they're free to go and complain and I don't see anything wrong with it so what happened to come that morning I get an email from the advice or the advice the same advice or who helped me all throughout that month to register and\nTo reserve or that event on campus um sends me an email saying that the hosting ... organization all of us in which drew their support for this about what drew the sponsorship for this event and henceforth\nUm this event was cancelled and on at the end of the emails she even noted that um she suggested that I I I moved to advance from to an off campus location\nSo basically the University of Rochester decides to um cancel your event and Turks you off campus well\nI I don't know exactly what happened I don't know why I don't know why she decided to um [noise] you know take that step but uh to to the eyes of many people it might look that way they've gotten has a lot of smoke around are terrified [laughter]\nRight but all I can say is that you know um I it was a big disappointment and also at the same time I was not only disgusted by what had happened but you know I I just I it it it's I was so\nUpset not because of the fact that my event was cancelled but because of the fact that we I personally felt that we were somehow compromising our values\nAs Americans as as as people were living on this land um to to practice this idea this this this right of free speech who think that was\nThought it was so hard looked at garden who made the phone call um soon who made the phone the phone call of I mean who do you think who made the phone call somebody made a phone call who was it\nI I can only I can only guess at this point I'm up maybe maybe it was maybe with some very upset student on campus maybe it was a ... the Chinese government maybe it was a some donor who who might have not been happy that this kind of\nWhy let's go let's go to mark Clifford for the answer would come to well we were talking before about um the the scholar Perry links 'em\nA suggestion that the Chinese government is a bit like an anaconda in a chandelier at a party everybody's enjoying nice party in the ballroom drinking champagne eating canopies whatever\nThe snake doesn't have to do very very much everybody knows it's there it reaches out every once in awhile often quite randomly you can't figure out why the snake does what it does but it keeps everybody in\nMine John there's another part to the story um we don't have time in this segment but we've got to get back to it because this is an issue of what at a campus administration is doing and what a tried to do to cover its tracks [noise]\nGordon Chang database mark Clifford is a former editor of the south China Morning post and we thank you very careful very careful scholar say who can tell the story of the University of Rochester yes there are other explanations but I think everybody just heard it not only in the United states

deliver on things like jobs that sounds familiar I'm so he needs investment and\nThe goal with the Chinese engagement was to try to get the financial engagement without the political or security compromise that sometimes goes with dealing with China\nAnd clearly has ... and the investment he expected from the United states\n[noise] it it has been as a as easy as it could have been um but I think there have been um problems on both sides there are a lot of\nUm vested interest in Delhi or that have been slowing things down as well um a lot of people made a lot of money from a lot of different sorts of relationships so\nI'm One weapons sales are involved um you're looking at relationships that may be going back decades including back to the Cold War times and um people in systems who um have vested interests and other alliances or other purchases\nSo clearing away all of that brush in order to get to things that are good for the strategic core of a nation can sometimes take a bit more time than expected\nThe puzzle about a lot of reporting does he have a neutral image in ... she regarded as somebody we can work with is there a general opinion\nThere's been a very long during they kind of so called non aligned period India's not aligned period um they did get a lot of weaponry from the Soviet Union and then from the Russians at a time when the U.S really wouldn't touch India at all\nSo um there is you know it it it's not considered a problem and um I think there was during during the time when um the west with backing some pretty nasty elements in Afghanistan\nUm the Indian knew that this ... hottest problem would flow back to India\nAnd were I'm not averse to working with the Soviets during that time either to try to contain it so a lot of their relationship with Russia is very much reflection of their immediate border you know the problems with our hottest on one side and the problem with China on the other and that's the lens through which they view their relationship with Moscow\nIncluding ... what is the studio glued between Islam about him do it today\nThat terrible uh and in fact what China did I'm immediately after ah India bought the ... the a missile defense system was it announced it was going to sell some very high tech drones to Pakistan so essentially opening up a second front\nFor that missile system to try to defend but from\nThe puzzle also about India playing the Russian card if that's what their play this can be a dangerous game the Russians are not easy to work with use\nThat forgotten the Soviet days does that regarded as that was all that was then there's just now is that the fresh thinking\nNot really because they're because if you look at the age of the people in both administrations they there are people who would have been engaging with each other perhaps his juniors\nOr during the Soviet period so they know each other um you know there there was there was all sorts of stories about Soviet infiltration into the Indian system during the during that period as well\nA lot of compromise material all that sort of stuff\nThat ... way of putting it yes [laughter]\nSo um you know I think it takes a long time to to to read that up but also you know they ... the Soviets were there for India at a time when sometimes others weren't but there that the more serious problem is that a lot of the stuff that Russia sold to India\nReally good and the ... tend to keep going up and that was a very slow delivery the actual quality and what it felt in the hot had any real problem\nYes I Wonder if they're going to send all those all broken ... and ... back to Moscow for their money back\nI'm not sure that right\nNow there by garden or the ... and it becomes much more um the great game here with Russia entering into us\nOh you know whoever wins India as a partner is certainly got the leverage because India is enormous within about four years maybe even fewer than that it will be the world's

it's been for me I'm a Seventy year old\nAnd uh I uh\nIt's always been colder value for me uh it's it's really a state they're saying or get terrier aided in the last year and I was wanting to know\nIf it\nIf he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting gold gold gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars now\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower than that so I I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters in the world and gold has not gone up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new\nKind of safety valve and even that haven't been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other ah precious metals platinum ... silver\nUm all the same silver has gone down dramatically a platinum is kind of a of a place I play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker lightweight zone none of the pressure smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim okay very good\nThanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add ... thanks for your service as well now a\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing decently we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on but I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so\nBut it really is a direct correlation with a interest rates and I mean the federal service raised rates a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury is now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platter them and let him\nBut ... do you see an interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond bear market\nWe basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's got up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds none of that fire for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month the so called quantitative easing program\nThat's over that's what over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening so when bonds come do they're not buying new ones not renewing and letting them mature\nSo to the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim and we've talked about this before but the deficit that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars knew that just that quarter alone\nToday there are options of the thirty about the ten year by they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nYields and builds go up and prices go down\nThere you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to the more we will certainly return to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break go take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nWhat eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas money answer as bad as I guess Jordan good when they're

percent skin going up is typically tied to the prime rate so people charging more and more and higher and higher rates all the time when consumer confidence is good and the economy's good Americans spent that's the way they celebrate by defending themselves into oblivion\nUm you know the the three big ones are student loan debt we've talked about one point five trillion credit cards over Detroit and car loans that that's up to about one point three trillion and those are just rising all the time and a real problem\nWhere some credit cards a particularly good and others not I mean you would think again that market forces if in fact we shopped the market forces would would drive those rates to a ... a reasonably consisted level\nWhere there are some that are lower income credit cards uh there's actually a free website to find the best deal anywhere which is a guide to credit card dot com\nFor example in Arkansas they have used ... siblings where they can't charge more than five points over the primary to primary today's five and a quarter so they basically they can't charge more than ten\nSo that's you know one way of getting them but there's a lot of other ways that people

Michael came ashore as a category for storm a fourth strongest land falling a hurricane in the continental us honest\nAnd I was noticing a doctor time or comments made by a Natasha regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can you can think of hurricane sort of like a leaf in a stream and that is a you know the the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a certain ... ah not moving very quickly what like Florence and there were certain linger over the place and that given period of time whereas\nA leaf in a fast moving stream like um like Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Florence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nBomb it certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um a window over a a area for a longer period of time and that has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall\nUm but in terms of the when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow and fast\nI say so in other words the the speed at which this storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's land speed is not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins\nNo no it isn't\nVery good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six by both by four six\nAll the remnants they're up continue to move across the Georgia having of course if the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd uh is still heading across the state of Georgia with our guest Dr Bryan tang uh this uh\nDepartment in which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they look at all these terms like a ... we'll satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his ... and early know what that is but\nIt sounds like you folks are are totally on touch a\nWith the with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time we use to make jokes about the weatherman and and how little they knew and compared with today I guess you know a lot today we act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that ended it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight it's it's the nature of the beast that weather prediction will always be uncertain to ... to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether interdict extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with formation\nWhat is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWhile in Atlantic ah we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form a in the middle of Africa\nAnd they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction of them will form into tropical depressions usually in August September and October\nBy that time of year I Know there is a season but they're going to be a wide\n... that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nUm that also when the uh the atmosphere is is a a ... the the more most moist um and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck of the woods over the winter that's when it's the furthest north\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to form for hurricanes to far\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with a well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of of what this thing could do and I asked him and said is there anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers at camp crunchy said yeah we can't get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure and low pressure areas\nIs that you can put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there\nYes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites and in space or take many many measurements are over the entire globe and all needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast a lot on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get ... uh\nWe we sort of learned about the Amish are more and more um we've definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked at the tropical psych load formation of this by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the uh [laughter] but now that the other part of your research intensification okay so the little tropical depression why do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight in intensity changes is one of the grand challenges of tropical sites on production that something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly San like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong\nA tropical site found or hurricane um so what sort of we we generally understand kind of what feels ... that is as you as you said for kind of the warmer ocean waters that a light below the chalk low a boat below the hurricane\nAnd that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for this to power when he's at the store\nAnd then that takes us to interactions with the the the climate system itself or are there uh are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression due to a storm to to hurricanes or portions of the planet where a a all else being equal a it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\n[noise] ... the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of the number of hurricanes that formed the um Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific\nI'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nI'm getting many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons by the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that there's another thing that I think confuses the lot of it's OK hurricanes in the Atlantic and I guess what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and it's in the western Pacific and psych phones yeah just sort of generic sites on the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting and those are just terms of convenience we are centrally talking about the same phenomena ride\n... which is why in the science community we just referred to everything at the ... phone instead of a hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nFair enough [noise] All right we will continue our discussion tonight and your calls welcome of course uh either as a a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather uh and also many experiences you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well\nAt one eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six our guest is

really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nYou're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and then a lot lot of people these days I don't remember a that storm because I did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right the pictures of of the the devastation along the coast uh\nOr was absolutely tremendous um what's what's different today perhaps is that uh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people and I'm buildings along the coast\nI'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy I'm just I'm because ... is a very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's their choice to do that you know [noise] yeah\nAnd there was a tremendous amount of that ... I went through the entire bank uh-huh I went to all of it so I mean I'm\nWell they got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that came to little not to ...\nOr ... yeah you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area I'm a tendency to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assume they can for instance they can take their windows and\nUm by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and that will be yet but I'm the the there's always we always stress you know before the hurricane season begins you have a plan you prepare and emergency kit and and it's it's up it's like this where

that in speaking with our previous caller a doctor tag and that is about our our\nPropensity for building in areas that the frankly just aren't safe and I've often wondered about that I mean ... when you see a condo that it's virtually right on the edge of the of the ocean I mean\nYou are just your begging for a for major problems there and I've I've often wondered why was zoning allows that yes I Know you're right that that we have this desire I Am on the ocean front well\nI'm Sorry that that's not good enough to me that that that that just foolish to this\nDay you touch on to the you know an important point and and something that I think needs to be discussed for and that\nUm you know where the terms of um [noise] how people managed to deter the risk and there there is risk everywhere right there is there's risk to to whether you can live in California there's risk of earthquakes if you're near a fault line [noise]\nUm but in in terms of um who's responsible for um absorbing that risk um we all buy insurance\nUm the federal government or has the national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast\nUm and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have homeowner's insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so you need to buy policies through a federal program or a private company that offers sort of flood insurance and\nI'm a sort of who you know pays for that that catastrophe poll a win win that that risk is realized um is kind of a ... is a subject of rape debate um controversy\nMhm absolutely uh it should do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be a changes in in\nSo what changes would you make in that regard if you could\nIt's it's a very very um complex question um I I certainly think I'm a you know it's it's really kind of up to how how the state and wants to start a craft of legislation on terms of\nUm there there are caps on insurance premiums another sort of policies that they can put out there I'm ... and and areas can put up zoning restrictions\nUm to prevent people from voting a risky areas and ah you know wondering one of the things that perhaps to incentivize\nPeople from voting and really really high risk areas is that if they do it in that area they have to take on to force themselves so they're not insured basically if you know they they lose their property um they they um owned the costs of it\nMichael has roads bow to shore and there's rampaging now across southern Georgia will continue our discussion with your calls at one eight

so much for having me happy and they knew people's day up before we get to the politics of the shooting ... unless you get those three letters Columbus ... on that first\nAh make let's make sure that the researchers clearly said that this is not an assumption or implication that there's an outburst of undocumented immigrants here in the U.S second ... is based on a very basic principle they said that they take in consideration the initial population plus everyone who comes in plus everyone who leaves\nThis points directly to what they want to say namely that is a shadowy population and

H. I. O. in Dayton, Ohio Jerry\nHey Brian one of the things that's really kind of frustrating to me is a conservative\nA guest on some of these shows like CNN where they were bad mouth and Kanye West and calling out is mental illnesses and saying he's\nThe token and all that stuff I don't know why nobody is asking why are you saying the same things\nAbout Mr Jim Brown who is also a supporter of the president who also is going to be at the White House\nOr you say he's an educated needs to read a book that he's a token I'm just curious why the liberal media would never say something like that about Mr Jim Brown because I think we all know the answer Brian you would probably show up in person and we fought back and he's a pretty intimidating force even at the age he is he's an awesome and very intelligent\nHe supports our president and you notice the liberal media is not say anything and I wish the conservative side of things we're kind of point that out that they they pick and choose\nWhy on Jerry represented I I like I like you come back but you can just know that is the way they're going after Jim Brown they're saying well he's gotten older\nAnd they're going after number two they say you know in the sixties and seventies he adds some clashes with women I have no idea the details of it but they do well you know back then it was big news 'cause he was not only a Hollywood star he was only sports stories of Hollywood star\nNow they're coming back and saying well wait a second we don't like the way he treated women in the sixties and seventies and he had an incident with his current wife with their with their car and now the black community that was saying back off Jim Brown they don't like his message now they're saying well he had problem with women

the little ice age and we'd been warming ever sense there's really not much in the last hundred and fifty years that looks\nA different from the first hundred and fifty years of the three hundred year warming so sure that\nThat's what I hear as old as the climate change deniers and none of my eye on the climate skeptic in terms of I'm skeptical of human link that is leading to catastrophic\nClimate change ah I see the same natural forces in in place\nDriving temperatures up and down and up and down ever since it has since the dawn of time and those are what Michael Mann and Al Gore want your listeners to believe is that those those seem natural forces that have been driving temperatures up and down\nSuddenly seized at the beginning of the twentieth century really really that's not how science works and your listeners know that so those same ... same natural forces are that have\nCaused a temperatures to increase in I'll I'll remind your listeners that historically going back forty five hundred years or so\nUm the the rise and fall of temperatures and clearly relate to the rise and fall of civilizations when it's warming period like we're in right now you can grow crops you can be delayed harvests and it's the cold periods really\nAre bad each cold period is corresponds to famine a death nasty population is just the opposite of what we're being told\nThey used to be before

much three times [noise]\nThree times a month\nOr\nTwo that perpetuate the line create the habit\nSo you you as you get interrupted by people that don't agree with you\nYeah it's it's really [noise] Brian as a scientist it's it it is hard and maybe see what's going on with that was really it\nDidn't mean nation of of the scientific process it used to be that that the scientific process welcomed people with counter counter views and and they would test those views but today we have to be shouted down the true science deniers\nOr those on the left that are ... on the ayatollah was of alarm is on there they cannot allow\nScience or any information any fact that might dispute their their their notion of man made catastrophic warming because if you get that in there and you start they accept one thing it's kind of like the camel's nose under the tent than uh they're almost admitting that they they\nBut some of them to admit that would mean that the sciences and saddle\nWhich I did a lot of places Greg since you do have a point of view and that people like Al Gore overstaying is\nSure I'd just for ... well I spoke at a recent scientific conferences in Houston where I was a greatly received there I I just got out of a conference in Pittsburgh my home base here this week\nUh there was ...

Saudi Arabia but work has contributed the Washington Post seems to be lured into ah so ah the Turkish embassy and killed a there was word as we think he's dead they picked up into steps and it was a big show up to the moon\nSaudi teams may have arrived to get them out we're trying to get to the bottom of it wouldn't be here I mean we as the president that he was a good thirty four\nChildren knowing where you can be killing more than ... everything is you have right now sir is in jeopardy now I'm going\nOut to find out what happened I mean I Do have no doubt and we're probably getting closer than your mind thing but I have to find out what what I\nMean we talked with Saudi Arabians a crown prince who's really running things did you not to do long my ...\nWell listen and he asked if he wants that pastor out of turkey as well so the relationship with turkey is also tense right now to think about this story number one is a journalist is operating freely in America I\nThink it should be a lesson to all journalists and all consumers of news there are so many people here stateside they complain about the treatment of journalists you want to know what when bad treatment of journalist says go anywhere else other than America and that's what you're going to experience I mean it's interesting that this happened in Turkey one of the places that has\nThe most journalists in prison than anywhere else in the world and yet this is this you know the Turks\nAre coming on and saying you know the Turkish government's coming on and and trying to take a stand because they're they're not happy with\nSaudi Arabia so there's a lot of different undercurrents here I don't know how big of a stand the president can take on this issue I mean obviously clearly it's bad I mean what happened to this journalists you see some of the graphic reports it's frightening\nUm but there's a lot I mean there's just a lot ten actor I'm really looking forward to your conversation with Senator Corker I just don't I don't know what the I don't know what the right call it for the president I think it ... it offers a lot of perspective for those of us who value freedom and the press\nAnd really want other journalists to be able to operate freely so we can all have an idea of what's accurately happening in the far flung places of the world and he's a really important for us ... do you run\nWe have a ... you know one of the big stories that was sort of I mean 'cause it's listen it's not the most exciting has been about ... you know gas prices that's been a really big ... you know the gas prices are near for your highest we haven't seen the levels and oils and all of a long time and some I think this is an interesting fact right every recession in the last\nFive recessions has been predated with a spike in oil prices so there you know you see what's happening with the markets and see what's happening with stocks and questions about interest rates and inflation oil as a part of that so we're really taking a look at that and the president had an interesting announcement about wanting to make the fuel that is more mixed with ethanol corn byproduct\nAvailable year round and they're you know there's a lot of strong feelings about that it can actually\nDamage your car Brian I don't know if you knew that but some cars can actually take that blends and um so it's really it's kind of I think that this story that's happening with fuel and the economy is a really big one it's one that we're really covering this weekend's Bernie's because it affects every part of our life even if you don't drive so that's definitely one\nRay losing eight hundred point because the fed raise interest rates 'cause every little panicky but it's weird to help you you are as an economy the more the interest rates go up ... to go down\nThat makes people nervous just because it's it's a way that makes them more expensive for us to borrow money you know but let's see it's hard to watch the markets this every every other day you know you got to take it in a month period and see what's happening but definitely scared people and when people start throwing around the world word recession I think we have to be careful you have\nTo do it responsibly we're nowhere clear that near that were near full employment but you know we've been on a ride for a little while several wondering when\nThey'll be a little bit of a breather and I think that that's a fair question to to be\n... Kanye West is going to lunch with Jim Brown and the president did you go to a prominent African American want to detain bleed activists who was the president's agenda should be a who should be their agenda and there were two black communities agenda on looking back\nAt a at the black vote over the last three ... three Republicans all are under twenty percent McCain Romney in Trump and now the three ... more than the other two\nDo you ever see their rebalancing back to a party that actually freed the slaves Nineteen sixty and had the black vote up until Nineteen sixty I think\nWhen it comes to vote for anyone whether they're\nBlack voters women's vote or Hispanic voters I think there's a tendency to to try to think about all of them at the you know ... these very specific groups that have very specific needs and and a lot of ways divide all of us I think there's some very you know there's some interesting analysis when you've got to dig into the way people register to vote and whether or not they\nVote but at the end of the day I think it's really about the economy for everyone and I'll be really curious what the what the um the results in the mid term election are when it comes to a different categories based on ethnicity and then moving forward I just\nI I tend to believe that people are kind of affected equally when it comes to some of these major issues with the economy like and you can I get a job\nCan I take care of my kids and am I safe and those are really basic questions that everyone needs answered so\nYou know I I don't I think all of that it can change is it a long way of saying short short answer I think all of it's going to be changing and I don't think I'm just like we've seen as you point out in history different parties have represented different platforms\nI just don't think anyone's dependable every party should be fighting for a vote and they should not take anything for granted\nBob would we uh so how do we get smarter news\nSmarter and is is a smart her smart H.

November second she'll be the Ford museum November first you'll see everything else out there also be in the Boston area is going to be exciting to\nWhere the effort Cumberland talks news talk Ninety four point one where the upper Cumberland seems taught\nAway off the rolls things like that um she's speaking to something that the left truly believe\nI'm voter suppression as I call it is something that they think is happening as it is not even a conspiracy theory for them it is just the fact that Republicans are are trying to suppress people from voting Republicans would say no we want more people to vote but we want people to register to vote and to do so legally\nAnd therefore that's why they're trying to like for example Nikki Haley in South Carolina when she was governor said\nA voter id actually will encourage more people to vote it will get more people into the system um anyway what Hillary as saying as a talking point that they use\nThat it might sound a little crazy to conservatives but Brian they truly believe that that's a good topic actually for me to do with Tucker next week\nFor that yeah it does do I don't mind you starting their conversation me going I was talking to Brian on the radio with that though I can tell me on the radio you as we used my wife and I don't want them to use I think it's like someone other Brian right like I don't know who else here with our salute I possibly be a pretty much don't even need a good idea actually because the electoral\nCollege one as well something that people talk about but they don't have a lot of they don't have a lot of the statistics behind them at the history behind them so that's what I tried to do with that and voter suppression and the issue of it\nI'll do that next week so there's a big story out today people making a big deal of Eric Holder saying what he should on top of what Hillary Clinton said there's no time for civility basically as long as we keep losing elections until we get the house or the Senate [noise] so do you have a problem with this\nTime for a cause Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are going to be dedicated as they are committed to say on the show was business you know when they go low we go low we do [laughter]\nWarnings about the president on Fox and friends to this\nTo better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's worked for you to discuss things safe for them to make for him to make a statement of like that is a very dangerous day but you know they talk about\nUs we are ... exactly opposite you know the rally is where they send people I I heard somebody yesterday on your show actually talking about my rallies\nThat my rallies or really calm and and will run and and packed with people we don't have problems that arose and I would say this it wasn't so successful for those protesters but they have to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous what older shows\nSo I put up a cruise Wallace and he says I'm totally blown outta proportion that it is not a big deal with Eric Holder said Dana Perino way and you could you don't\nHave server I I'm ... and and looking at it so regardless of what I think Michelle Obama didn't like it right he was using her language and she said no no no that's not that's not what I meant that's not that's not what I'm for and she's trying to be\nThe leader that she wants to be and that she would like to have for the country I oh I didn't know that Michelle Obama weighed in on whatever and yeah and I only saw it on Twitter so I didn't say a lot but she was basically like oh no\nThat's not that's not where I Am I'm however I also think that there is a way you can blow things out of proportion for example when at all of the rallies Trump starts to chant lock her up or or somebody starts at lock her up and and not that the president does it but\nAnd it's it's a a laugh line look if you look at what Eric Holder's doing he was trying to rally up a crowd small crowd and a little room but they all laughed and so I can I I don't want to blow anything out of proportion I Am concerned do more about the deeds\nRight because Brian you know personally like it's not so much to say oh go harass people and say nothing happens no but they're actually harassing people so for me when it turned goes from words ... that's a huge\nHuge concern so everybody's talking about a ... position which has got a new procedure because of prison United States or put them on the nose to Security Council\nAnd that's who's open chair now ... at the un and a lot of people have their candidate you I mean we've heard or Ryan Zinke he was in the air for for an interview uh people are brought up senator Ayotte I've thought Joe Lieberman might be fined for this\nBut also the leading candidate he just thought to be Dina Powell aren't you you would deal with ...\nPowell seems like a nice person lots of people like her is she the right person for the job that's the question\nWell she's worked on behalf of virtually every idea that President Trump who ran against in his two thousand sixteen campaign from people remember said it was time for America to act on its own behalf for once internationally and to avoid pointless and counter productive wars ... they are not\nBefore joining the Trump Administration she was a partner at Goldman Sachs she was president of the Goldman Sachs foundation that's the nonprofit arm of the investment back while they're short extensively with another ... famous foundation the Clinton Foundation and they work together and various goals that most from voters would fund repugnant\nShow me your thoughts on this well so um\nI again I'm agnostic as to who the president's support 'em I hadn't heard that Joe Lieberman one that's interesting but I think the president is going to want some of that he knows and trust that is really important to him\nSo the Ryan Zinke he uh pick would make sense to me Dina power for him and I think that ... that he just had something wrong here like she didn't work for the Clinton Foundation and actually the program that she worked on she created what's called ten thousand women and it was a way to help\nYoung women entrepreneurs from around the world to figure out a way to become entrepreneur self sufficient they did not use a dime of government money I'm pretty sure\nWell at the national Security Council actually wrote President Trump's national security strategy when that document came out it was widely praised\nBy most except for on the far left and one of the things that she focused on most is or what the president is concerned about and because I watch soccer I Know he's concerned about the number one enemy the United states identified as China and\nNot the middle east and she was in Russia and she was really strong about pulling out of the Iran deal right supported the president on that so I think that um criticism about her on those things\nAre probably a probably on this ... way back when when I first met her\nShe worked for Newt Gingrich while\nI Do get two people were I mean think saying that she would be the best person for that job so and I don't think it's it's a it's it's I I don't think it's a small back to the Nikki Haley was woman and I think that he could have more women and more minorities in his\nCat on he knows

... to a wonderful thank you hope you are I'm doing wonderful thank you for taking my call sure so I have a quick question\nProbably not a simple answer the question ... when you have a bank account you have FDIC\nInsurance and credit unions have their own insurance [noise] but in the low cost um investors terms\nI Everytime I call and ask I get the well we're not going to go bankrupt\n[laughter] that's no answer is it\nNo it's not so what kind of protection is due out\nOkay so it depends on what you're actually doing like if you own of a series of funds bike you own mutual funds are index funds the value of what you have is controlled by the holdings inside that fine\nSo the value when you invest goes up and down the find itself is not at risk and less the investments in it [noise]\nGo to zero\nSo let's say you buy 'em an index fund\nFrom one of the big discounters from vanguard fidelity Schwab someone like that who you know those three are taking so much market share or you end up owning a ATF from one of the you know one of the black rocky ts those are the the big discounters and the market\nThe money that is in a fund\nIs secure in that fund there's never been a situation where a money has been stolen and it's just a well and the money's gone [noise]\nThe money in a a brokerage does not have as you mentioned FDIC insurance or anything like that the holdings are protected by what's called S. I. P. C. did anybody mentioned SSI PC to you\nI seen it at the bottom of the page when you're looking at the site\nAnd S. I. P. C. as a vastly inferior protection for you than what you have added a credit union through in the u._s._a. or at a bank through FDIC\nSo as I PC is a privatize version of protection and the most contentious cases of involved where a brokerage has been crooked\nAnd S. I. P. C. has not been there to protect people and the event of a brokerage going insolvent CSI PC takes care of people but if it's involved fraud or something like that they don't\nPut your money how is it held is it in mutual funds or ...\n... most ... most of it as a mutual funds indexes and then I or a I'm a little bit of it is in money market now with money market would be different than the funds\nSo money market works a little differently and last decade during the ah banking scandals there were I think to money market funds they couldn't pay out\nPeople's accounts and they went at least temporarily insolvent and it was a terrible problem very upsetting to people\nAnd a money market situation that brokerage\nYou can either have the money and uh pitiful you're earning FDIC insured a account or you can have it in a money market account where the interest changes each day [noise]\nAnd I have my money and money market I'm not particularly worried because even last decade when we had this this series a banking scandals [noise]\nYou know one of any and there was no significant or meaningful loss for anybody from any of the money market even the ones that temporarily went insolvent ultimately paid people the money they owed them almost a hundred percent [noise]\nWonderful thank you very much for answered the question the big risk always is with a smaller brokerage that may be crooked and that's when your money is at greatest risk gift that keeps you any comfort but does thank you very much my best to you ... thank you Bye bye\nRobert's with us on the Clark

in October to talk about winter but I got to 'cause I got to talk about your wallet there's new data that shows that the amount of natural gas which were used for\nRoughly sixty percent of our energy in the United states that number may be off a little somewhere more or less sixty percent now\nNatural gas is in shorter supply than it's been in recent years as we head towards colder weather months and one of the ironies of natural gas is it's now used for things way beyond just providing heat\nBecause more and more power companies around the country use natural gas is their main source to produce electricity so natural gas has gone from being a smaller market\nServing heating needs for people and in certain households providing a natural gas cook tops there's a lot of people prefer cooking with gas rather than electricity\n... we're just say that yes even though natural gas is used for boat that's the big change so the overall market demand for natural gas is much larger the current supply a little smaller\nThat we have a decent chance of seeing higher prices on natural gas\nRemember you got hit on both sides of the equation even if you don't use natural gas you're home you're still affected almost certainly on the electricity side\nSo no one can know what's gonna happen with the wintertime temperatures are we going to see a cold winter or not it's going to be another mild winter we don't know that\nBut what we do know is that the odds are higher than we can see price spikes so what I recommend to you is they use this time to do simple things to reduce the

E. pi\nTo do that at your incorporated yes oh well I've talked with several people are their financial planners that I Know and everyone says that simple that's not the same thing right\nKnow as simple as there is something I'm poll about a simple simple wire is pretty extensive paperwork ...\nDoes not and when I went to like you to do is I have a list of companies that you can trust\nTo advise you on how you handle building a retirement plan some of that stuff you said to your so puzzled you feel like you've gotten burned trying to make decisions\nAnd I've got a list of companies that you can invest directly with and then I have two groups you could go to where you can talk with somebody who can advise you\nAnd if you choose to even have somebody who you pay to manage retirement funds for you yeah and focus on your business and have them do it\nOne of the group is Garrett planning network that you'll see on cork dot com\nThe other is not for the national association of personal financial advisors\nAnd either of those groups you can you can see they use different strategies to help you and then look at my investment guide for companies that I really trust for you to use for that investing guidance for your retirement account\nSteaming is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Steven\nHey Clark how're you doing great thank you you're saving for a home I Am congratulations yeah so my wife and I recently got married and the last quarter and congratulations again [laughter]\nThank you and sought our tax return and we got a little bit more back to their expecting wanting to start saving for a down payment probably ten years from now\nOh my goodness you are in advance planner I have never had anybody ever\nCalled me about saving for a down payment on a house or to purchase a house who said it was something they were doing ten years out\nThat's what they say\nThey're trying to plan ahead a little ... and other problems\nLook I Will they'll hate us and so we're just wondering what is the best place to put our money and we should just put in Iraq IRA and then I Would travel and we need it or\nYeah I mean if you got a ten year window that really changes the answer and you are right\nJust continuing to make your deposits in your Roth IRA and the freedom you have to withdraw contributions a decade from now with no consequences in terms of penalty or tax\nIt would be a very intelligent strategy and with a ten year window you can take more\nIt would be really consider to be short term risk but long term smart then you could if you were doing something like like putting money in a savings account today yeah so and the savings we've ... each year\nWhat kind of fun to ... a charter ... fund or you\nKnow I Would do a balance find like the vanguard star fun\nOkay if you look at the star fund requires a thousand dollar minimum to open and then has a very diverse portfolio of what your money goes into\nAnd you do stand the risk in the shorter term you know at some point we could have a correction we will have a correction in the stock market and you could think that I gave you the worst advice ever\nRight telling you to put money at risk and investments but again we're talking a ten year period and going and something like the star fund is\nA moderate risk choice to invest money and has extremely low cost for the management of it and then what happens is let's say ten years from now you are pulling money out for the down payment you don't touch any of the earnings\nBecause if you pull out earnings then you get hit with tax and penalties\n... just the contribution\nRight and with the with the contributions it's a completely non event as far as the IRS concert\nAnd if you end up in a position a decade out you're buying a home\nAnd you don't need to touch as much money as you expect it from the Roth or maybe your circumstances change and you don't need to touch any of it all the good cause you would've had already a ten year period of growth of money for retirement that you're able to leave in there\nAnd let it continue to grow tax free for retirement\nPerfect that sounded like thank you for that\nAnd it's like you're a throwback to an entirely different era and America nobody ever differs their wants like you're describing so good for you and again

you're going to get out one of you believe you rented a lot you're going to get killed right I mean\n... that's hoping hopelessness and all of a U.S me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us\nTo do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you what you you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of that and my ... and ... thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand it's nothing I swam thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and a little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things that steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nThat's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was a very upset\nAbout the world is coming to an ... and her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort her [laughter] now why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHope ... well\nWe've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been and have experiences that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't\nCall [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right\nWe have perspective and so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side\nYeah the side of it then you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer\nAnd it it's going to grow some things in your future you know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you ... there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the young man I was just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situations is one of the problem is the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought gee I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that you wouldn't get in it\nIt's like go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because she knew that money come from work is where it comes from and I can't get an of ours will than work someplace else work more\nWork all the time but but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean our when we were going broke two babies and wife houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it or your mind off and well you know you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know and and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter\nOnly thing is just perspective as like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich\nAnd\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out because it it always worked out and I had the perspective that Bangalore guy [laughter]\nIt's going to be awful and but because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these traction these rods with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same they only different issue is your perspective\nAnd so I'm challenging some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're\nNot stuck you're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow is not going to stay the same you are not stuck so\nLook the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say whatever I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now\nFor me to never be here again that's a question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I help\nI'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with everything I have been through and I have no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long will take but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see what I'm Talking about here is ... is is vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action it\nIt's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you got to do a series of steps you got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's going to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza at

it's one of the reasons I read biographies of successful people as he lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nAnd and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make

the um\n[noise] I I just I really think that I mean I\nI have never seen anything that indicates that scary North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean you know\nMaybe you need to move twenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper but I'm the numbers you're giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you haven't\nLooked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes or whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out pan back a little bit and\nDial out just a little bit mileage was from where you are looking to get ... you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall this I carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents them Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that the you know one end of North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other end now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue a and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're\nUm you look in a different into town of Kerry or you move a

Florida beach Georgia\nBecause I think Alabama and UGA I don't think they really been tested I don't think they played in it I think the strength of schedule is awful weak especially the judges\nUs and I think you're right and um I I think you're right about that\nBut I um\nI Do know the personnel and those two schools in in their eyes to me they're superior that doesn't mean they're going to win\nBut I I I think the coaching in Florida has been spectacular the I I I'm to me the uh I'm having a hard time believing that LA she was going to knock off Alabama but a\nJones let's see what happens a lot and I'm not one for to offer cliches but I I don't see that one coming to fruition but that's why you play the games\nWell yeah that's true no I mean I I didn't tell you I I'm not calling to have you locked up a forgiving and thinking about it down on paper and a half later stats are you going to the game and then call the\nThey call the straight jacket people over in Atlanta to make sure they have your size in fact the family by [laughter]\nGot left scores up next\nTop thank you thank you for taking my call Paul I'm just a couple of things um yesterday I really enjoyed the fern interviewed thank you um yeah and what's the name of his book\nWhen does it come into play by play comes out Tuesday it's available now on Amazon but you know it's in it's in it's in the book stores on Tuesday\nThis year he's not really found his identity as far as when it comes to the office now I Know he needs a lot more protection but it just seems like he's got a lot more walls and struggles this year and a lot first question is Paul on he was protected high in the NFL and I guess to start\nThis conversation you find it too far fetched that maybe he shouldn't go this year I'm\nTrying to remember where he is class was or does he ... he has one more year right\nYeah he can actually he can actually graduated endeared still have a when you're ... left\nI think it's too early to say and I I really would like to see because I I think there are there are mitigating circumstances right now I I'm a believer in Jarrett\nA ride that were down there tomorrow so give me a let me let me talk to people and kind of get a better sense of I mean I Know with the issues are they're pretty obvious to anyone who watch football but\nI'd like to know if there's something going on that we don't know about\nRight okay that sounds good just if you can moving forward they only they only twist it out I guess I Want you to dig into in this that you do your research is is it too far fetched that he does it go pro or even better or do you think he stays at all burnt and this is a topic that I Would like to talk about in the future\n[noise] yeah I think it's an interesting one um would you do on the field matters but you're the evaluation is going to matter even more and I I really haven't talked to a pro scouts but I Will usually see a couple on Sunday Morning when I'm up to the SPN and\nWe will we will effort that wouldn't thank you very very much Terry is up next hello Terry\nBy doing is we're doing well thank you Bob ... map and a lot of ...

Bo [laughter] or\nOr Peyton Manning or Tommy Frazier and he I was just kind of go right down the list of Vince Young Matt line or do I mean some of the greatest quarterbacks of all time\nUh I think he could he could end up there but ...\nIf he ... well no he's a he's a he's a sophomore he played last year\nIf you remember ... as they wanted a ...\nYear but I mean if he wins the championship won in ...\nNew book and what he did last January to this yeah but you may vary then you can say maybe he had the greatest season ever but uh he's got a long way to go before I call him the greatest quarterback I've ever seen\n... agreed with the one out of ... when I'm Out here from all over by a A R brand the Alabama and play down by ... nobody or in a ... kind of true there have been you know that love and challenged very mud this year so\nLet me tell you this to a coach's with whom I speak tell me though\nThey have never seen a quarterback play like two has this year but uh but I I just think and and thank you I mean that's the great party shows like the one I was on yesterday you come up with absolutes and I'm a little more of a traditionalist uh it's hard to make a statement like\nThat in a in a on October tenth which was yesterday uh but I I I think you have to consider it but not not\nQuite yet hammer like a guy name hammer hammer go right ahead\nFast thanks fault\nScreen MSA hammer right here ah anyway how's how's your new record coming working mc\n...

just think it looks better as a a as an ornament\nOff enjoy life enjoy life okay thank you well anyway so I wanted to call in and talk about the gentleman that called earlier a seed graduated in sixty two and talk about the sweat versus the SEC yes that was a fascinating fantastic\nAnd then I'll get into one to talk about I Lived in Ohio for sixty two to sixty eight and a played football up there was a so so player then I transferred to bury right when coach family took over for a while ago\nIt was like hello this is really football um and also a was there a Seventy when you were correct Wilbur Jackson did have a scholarship I don't think it was very well received John Mitchell\nUh I don't know if he had the scholarship be definitely started the next year I'm trying to remember\nJohn ah John may have come later he was a he was a ... a he was at a junior college in Arizona so he may have come after the season\nWell he he absolutely had an impact he was a first starter and build Wilbur and John or just outstanding gentleman\n... you know John John used to be a neighbor of mine in Birmingham and I got to know him and went over his house occasionally and it's just an amazing guy\nYes he was in a couple of things I'd like to point out about that time a first of all I Do\nMy first time I ever went to my sister was an Ohio State student and I went to Ohio State Michigan and then my first Alabama game was that southern Cal game\nI think it's overrated on changing everybody's mind I think it definitely hit a very major impact where might have been twenty five foreign Seventy five percent against\nA it became fifty fifty eight to that game so it was a huge impact um but I think the ... new long before that game that if he didn't get the best athletes he wasn't going to be able to compete\nBut ... you know there's a coach Brian ... blanket leave defending him he tried to\nIntegrate the Alabama team earlier um he was very careful in in a manner that he did it and he got a couple of other players picked out they just didn't work out because he knew\nThat when you'd wind and see him Newton later would say that as well and basketball but and then people nobody thinks is the wrong way but you had to do with the right way so it could be accepted in in a brace and that's what that's what took so long\nNow and and I agree with that and I do think the southern Cal game was a very smart move and it was a very big impact um comparing the slack and I'd like to include the Big Ten and the SEC\nI really do believe in having seen those schools um the the Big Ten was overrated because it's all papers the sweat kids and teens that could stand up with anybody\nThe SEC as a whole wasn't very strong man and you got to pick the year that Alabama was because there was a huge swing in the early and mid sixties literally Jordan Joe name a day or those guys you compete with anybody or in the ... with\nSeattle supersonic starter jacket ah this past weekend I didn't have a football game I actually was out in Seattle to interview Kevin Durant and Brianna Stewart to the best basketball players on the planet well and after the interview was over I attended the\nGolden State warriors Sacramento Kings' game and then I when I went out and had a couple of beers and while I was out having a couple of beers this guy walked up to me very con gas and rice was his name said hello so appreciative that I was out there he literally gave me\nThe jacket off his back off on bomb I Know that happens to you all across the SEC every single Saturday I don't know if I'm more surprised\nBy the fact you got a free jacket or you were having a couple of beers\nShocking development I Know that is very unlike me it was very unlikely\nTo be I I Know Seattle's known for its coffee what what's the beer out there\nI had this amber beer I Wish I knew the name of it 'cause they probably send me a whole lot of free beer if I could say it on the atomic bomb show I don't know the name of it but I definitely had too much of it\nAnd I had too much of it if you had an now he'd have it in the morning and muggy cousy yeah but I don't\nKnow where where were they gave us the gas ... or ... see that\nThey're not putting a lot of money into a [laughter]\nAnd it puts a not a lot of marketing materials firebombs show on it and yeah but they should get on that team what are we doing come on ... on it um so ah okay where where do we start to senator right now a\nDays going by the ana I own dinner and see the Georgia Bulldogs is in LSU enough ill like Georgia seasons kind of kind of starting now right yeah I mean it took awhile over the next like five weeks this is it when they get on with it or you know they're all mad right dry here George fans all the time you you're not talking about a sea\nThey tracked no respect for that I haven't given an ... that it hasn't been anything to talk about now they did beat South Carolina pretty bad yeah okay well then in the next five weeks if they win these four games than\nThe we'll talk muggy are actually knows their schedule by heart so I tell you each one of those opponent while I was lord of the ...

be quite an experience and appreciate automatic of war\nTo get them to last you off the side I was on the USS Enterprise today don't need to learn on\nAnother one is that the one in Star Trek this it orally enterprise and kept better than I but I was actually there with\n... with a bunch of race car drivers oh and they were coming back I just saw six month float in the Mediterranean and then they parked off the coast because there were two days early and we're sitting out there whether they lost to solve the plane the whole thing or the storm and the storm was so big that the new enterprise is doing this to the race car drivers were like begging them to get off the ship because it was\n... and those are the guys who are used equilibrium like or you're in the don't touch any red button stay

Georgia would think Ninety eight we lost by one point and there was a play at the end of that game where we had to pass\nOn to go down to like the Georgia four or five your mind and there was a it was a safety from Georgia by the name of Kirby Smart back there who made a play on the ball so I I actually played against curvy\nTiger stadium and now Kirby coaches against LSU a nice stadium so it it's a it's a team to LSU doesn't play a lot but it's a team that you respect tremendously especially coming from the state of Georgia with everything that Kirby's done right now there's no secret Georgia\nIs is what the two or three maybe four most talented teams in America\nAre they are loaded everywhere you look a\nLSU coming off the tough loss of Florida the games in tiger stadium so you've got to think that the crowd is going to spread them for them to play on better then maybe they will be it's going to be a tough task on Saturday afternoon ...\nYeah we just saw some video that gave you a good there Jim Donnan coaching the dog's a good friend of ours and we'll talk to the gym shortly by here in the next couple of days a book or I'm your thoughts on LSU though are certainly\nIt seemed a like a storybook season and then Saturday seem familiar as well\nHere's would always say well let's take a look at it from the from the uh from the micro look okay let's look at the game on Saturday disappointing loss on the road or to a team which that you think you're better than I I think when you look at Florida gambling to an outstanding job he's talked grant them\nAnd and those kid the crowd behind him oh LSU made too many mistakes they couldn't stop Tehran now let's take a look at it from ten thousand feet if I told you have to six games LSU will be father one with a home game in Georgia at the beginning of the season I think everybody in Baton Rouge to sign up and take that so\nI I think you got to look at it both ways\nThink you've got to understand where you are um\nOr who's betting any any of our money's Paul expects LSU went on Saturday higher I think what's expected the type of game is played I fully expect the game to be a fourth quarter game and I think if you're a coach Joe\nYou're you had a really good spot right now because your father want after playing a pretty tough schedule now the schedule gets tougher as we do however this is a crucial game and he's a good situation because in my opinion he doesn't have to win the game but he did not go out there and take a stadium and lose about Twenty one point\nThis game better be a fourth quarter gave you better challenge Georgia boat intellectually in athletically on the field and so I think if you're a realist about this game you want to see a competitive game\nAnd if the ball bounces your way I think unless you can get no doubt compete against Florida is excuse me Georgia is gonna be can they do it for four quarters and get this game to the fourth quarter but I I think if you will is you've got to be realistic on where you are right now and what to expect on Saturday\nBurger McFarlane weather's he may be doing Monday Night football but not much has changed in the SEC uh on the other side butter Alabama continues to lead however as great as he often says the defense seems longer about what have you seen so far\nFor the defense is young ... ... no longer do you have guys play three four

little bit will ah will lead into a you know the next three games of a you know kind of coming out and and landed all out on the table\nI Know those are the coaching staff like yours I'm sure you spend a little bit of time looking at yourself what are we going to things you see in the ...\nYou know it's just it's one of the things where would you\nBe in the uh you know so young and inexperienced I mean we want to try to uh\nYou know a lemonade some of the mistakes that we were making earlier in the year uh and and hopefully you know and get every kid that we can possibly get on him to wear over the off season uh you know we can kind of sit down with that individual and be like okay this is\nWhat we were doing maybe earlier in the year this is what you were doing later in the year uh in in this is what we need you to do before next season starts a and so uh it's it's been a good ... or you know uh as far as self scouting ourselves I mean that's a lot of the things that we're doing right now is just trying to\nGet as many kids all the families we possibly can in different positions to see a a word we're working you fit in next year and then like I said also about\nUm you know trying to eliminate as a and and fixes many mistakes as we've been making 'em and just trying to just get better each and every week\nAnd it's such an underappreciated part I think my weeks especially is you know that ability to look at yourself but also build your library of things that you're going to work on in January and February and march is you start building toward a new season\nRight and you know in in on I ... it or you know this past week about you know we understand that we're not going to the playoffs and uh uh so we have three games left but let's make the most of those three games in some of these kids you know and I and I told them I'm like\nIf we feel like for the week that you have a uh that you know what you're supposed to do a you know every kid that we have we'll play the next three ball games just cause I feel like that's the only way that we're going to be able to evaluate them\nIs to put them out there and and see what they can do and and the game time situations goes you know again it's one thing about\nUh you know seeing what they could to practice but it's another uh whenever the lights come on uh have you know I mean you might find that dominant rough that just a is a gamer that ah [laughter] you know that uh\nHopefully that ah you know it'll be something in a good experience for some of these kids and that will lead to some good things in the next couple of years\nAnd I know I've seen over the years I'm sure you have is well you know those last two or three games of the season somebody comes on they they the the light bulb turns on and then it really builds in the next season and somebody that you may not have expected that can help you\nYou're exactly right you know last game I felt like you know we had a a freshman a lineman that came out of nowhere last week and or two weeks ago in a a and he had a good game\nWe'll continue to get more playing time and more and look and then\nUm and hopefully that ah ah you know some of these other kids will will see that and say that it doesn't matter what grade you're in I mean right now I mean\nI feel like you know this on the season that everybody's pretty much a a grade or older anyway because you know you shouldn't be making freshmen mistake that they've been through the season if you've been playing since game on\n'em in the same thing as a junior I feel like those juniors now or should be a a plant like seniors and er and things like that but uh you know all in all I mean are\nThese kids are you know this past week have or have came out and very

the running back you've got to make sure that you can pain or the quarterback is well and then the fence we I mean they're going to bring pressure from from various places and uh\nYou know we just got a a you know the what we do and then and tried to eliminate our mistakes and negative plays in a you know and like I said you know it's not always a bad thing and then you know we've been killed by\nA
