the committee would go to her over such where they would so the whole thing was is just a sham using a when it happened what year it happened how many people were there were the house was what the

notice oh my gosh white is just it's the way Hannity uses the word literally it's an intense of fire it has no actual meaning other than um it's really bad\nAt the white\nRich so bad because of his white news in colder no more Mr White guy ... you cite a bunch of these quotes from from the idiots on the left the media\nYou've got to be understanding they have all these white men no because he

good evening the news for the people of the United states just spectacular because at the last moment the Trump Administration concluded to deal with the Trudeau government in Canada\nFor just guarding the NAFTA that was unacceptable to the Trump Administration and embracing a new creature called us MCA which my guess was peak of the hill and Fox News and I both agree we can't pronounce so we just spell it out us the MCAA Lizz very good evening to\nUnited States Mexico Canada agreement a pending approval by the Congress next year and that will itself be\nA short story we are looking at a deal that no one thought would be here for weeks now as I mentioned to the audience you have just Baird please get Canada done we can't do this without Canada where's Canada will candidates here are you satisfied with what we know so far if you ask them to be a good even if you live\nEvening John I Am satisfied I'm actually cheered by what they accomplished and the reason it wasn't getting done is\nPartly political and partly because there were certain issues and in particular dairy terrorists\nOr that Canada was really unwilling to budge on the political reality is that Justin Trudeau didn't want to seem like a weakling in ... you know facing off against Donald Trump if you remember back at the G seven meetings or they had a bit of a contract tall and\nA true does polling went through the roof for the first time in months because it was considered that he had sort of face down Donald Trump well\nHe didn't want it sort of ... on that but at the same time his liberal party was getting killed in one election after another and not doing well and here's the thing Canada is a very export dependent economy they needed NAFTA they needed to get\nA a treaty in place so that\nTheir major export market was still in place a and so they had to come to the table I really just thought it was a matter of time but I also thought it was incredibly important to have a when if you want to look at it that way and I do before the midterm elections because let's face it Donald Trump has gone after they eat you and\nA China and our partners in NAFTA a and practically everybody else under the sun and you can only do that so long without people saying\nWhere's the bacon where's the beef and finally he brought home the bacon this deal I think\nA is quite a good one it does give our dairy farmers greater access to Canada without getting into the weeds there was a sort of and run that dairy farmers had done around uh the terrorists in Canada which are on average about two hundred and Seventy percent [noise]\nBut then Canada blocked that access and so this now is on blocked and our dairy farmers won't be able to export more to Canada I'm also poultry and eggs are those are\nThe products also are going to be more freely flowing north uh and then the other big thing of course as automobiles and the supply chains being kept in place a Trump did push through an

comment on the domestic economy we've dealt with the overseas the economy the trade negotiations but now\nThe market responded very well to the U.S embassy a news Liz and here we are in the fourth quarter there's a lot of consumption going on in the United states I have not heard anything about is flowing momentum if anything I've seen house prices maintain their heights\nMaybe there's a shortage and supply at the starting and have you heard any interruption in the shopping or in the consumer confidence please\nNo I I think you're looking at a spending being very strong in the third quarter and everything I read suggests it's going to be very strong as well and the fourth quarter we're talking about growth three and a half percent kind of\nTerritory a look when you have the Federal Reserve chair Jeremy pal talking about the U.S economy being a little too good to be true\nAnd talking about how they're going to be any recession until twenty twenty uh you know that's a that's a pretty good indicator and I don't think he is someone whose political I don't think he's saying it except that is what he sees\nTrying to be a increasing interest rates pretty steadily throughout the next year so\nRight now um I don't see in the marketplace any excesses that are particularly worrisome there is a lot of debt around but gosh guess white folks when you have one percent interest rates forever\nPeople borrow instead of issuing equity or whatever\nUh and that has had some impact probably on stock prices but it also has meant that interest uh that the debt levels have gone up but it's not at all that kind of situation we had in two thousand seven two thousand eight when we all knew something was profoundly wrong there is no sense of that today whatsoever\nAnd the market is high and Main street is being a strong dollar so we're looking at a good Christmas season I've not seen a negative report on that in fact what I have seen is shortage of workers to stuff up the retail\nWell that's right in fact all the retail uh companies are out there raising at Amazon today announced today that they were going to be going wrong Fifteen dollars an hour for all their employees others have raised wages to uh make sure that they have enough seasonal workers and the numbers that the increase year over year\nTarget I think was twenty percent they're not alone in that that that suggests that they're looking at incredibly good indicators are for the cause an upcoming holiday season and don't forget for many companies that's like two thirds of the year so it's hugely important I think we're going to have a gang busters fourth quarter\nAnd you know the question is then does all of that translate right well for the Republicans in the mid term elections it's hard to imagine that it won't it's hard to imagine that Americans are going to be\nI'm completely indifferent to the idea that Democrats could raise their taxes or at least roll back the tax cuts that are came through early in this administration\nOr the people are saying there are other big concern is health care and I would say they're\nA Donald Trump talked about that today in his meeting with the electric or his speech to the electrical workers group ah and talking about how the Republicans have done such a great job on health care rates are going to go up next year they really it it's if that is true they need to really broadcast that because boy that's not the perception\nYeah this last minute ... who lived it is it is we're going to watch the the reporting on Capitol weary\nIt's

Fifteen dead in Syria Steven the initial reaction and the Kremlin was\nExtremely belligerent and there were moments that there were it was looking as if the de confliction between Israel and Russia had failed\nThere was eventually a phone call between the president and the prime minister however my concern here is how the war party deals with this memory of the deaths of their comrades\nSo let's get the context I have argued and I don't think you disagree that for several years the new Cold War has developed\nAt least three bronze where Cold War could become hot war one is obviously Ukraine's everybody understands that there's a proxy work on the other is in the Baltic reaching a on the\nOn Russia's neighboring border with neighboring small Baltic states slapped in the ... to a certain extent Poland when NATO is undergoing a very large and growing and permanent military buildup on Russia's borders and third day in Syria\nWhich I think we all understood but the lack of clarity of the danger there because you have\nSo many powers fighting in Syria but in particular with Russia and the United States Russia legally is in Syria the United states\nAnd turkey involved\nLee the multiple opportunities for something to go wrong and things have gone wrong before so they set up as you said the United states and Russia did this so called confliction\nWhich means something like jeez let's try to avoid an accident and not shoot each other down\nAnd there've been close calls with this big confliction mechanism\nAs war but I've always said you you know today it works tomorrow it doesn't work\nIn war zones so much remind uh our our folks listening what happened on September Seventeen Israel attack Iranian forces it's sad and\nEnded up with the Syrians shooting down a Russian reconnaissance plane it wasn't a combat I it was a con Edison's play an off Fifteen Russians aboard the plane died [noise] um\nThe charge was and it was real really didn't deny this bed maneuvered\nIn a way to put the Syrian planes chasing the rushing out there the Israeli planes behind this Russian plane they use the Russian plane as cover\nInadvertently the Syrian shot down the Russian plane so as you say this is where people who study\nRussians reactions do more than just read the New York times you can go to the source you look at what the Russians pay per se or television or radio and what happened here is very interesting and it confirms pieces that I've stated on your broadcast for years\nBut people have criticized than in the context of the Russian policy elite who is a moderate\nHe's moderate\nThey're hacks\nAnd the people more ... with ... ... the first reaction\nI guess was fascinating John was for ... to say it had been a terrible accident\nIn the fog of war\nSo looking exonerated Israel\nReaction from ... own ministry of defense was very angry they rejected publicly some of the ... spokesman on radio or TV or the newspapers this explanation and they said Israel did it intentionally\nRight they said the Israeli shot the aircraft down that was not a fact but that was the ... the angry statements in the first hours yes\nThey they just kept saying Israel I yes Israel is responsible and back who didn't want to do that why not first of all a if he had developed very very good relations with Israel\nRussia improvement that would make Yahoo and [noise] so what happened is that is neat and wants to fly to Moscow\nAnd basically either explained a potent are begging forgiveness and ... says no you can't come\nJust a moment that it will continue I'm

about exactly three years ago September two thousand this thing and everybody in the west that it would be a disaster and the Russians couldn't do anything with from that moment\nBecause it was Russia that destroy the Islamic state not the United states in Syria\nOr do during the two thousand six team presidential election that she was president\nShe would declare a no fly zone over Syria so Russians couldn't fly there you can see how far potent and Russia have come on the world stage by this this act I mean I don't want to say it in a primitive way because world politics is not a game but Russia's back in the biggest imaginable why\nIt's a very great world power no matter its problems at home and to the extent\nThat the United states now acknowledges that it will have to acknowledge\nThat it needs Russia's permission to operate in Syria and showed as Israel that has a lot of political implications particularly with an American president who can't have a phone call it cool and without being called a traitor in this country so we got that's why the Russia gate complicates everything\nLet me just say one other thing and I'll get off of this\nI Want to move to Ukraine

know they got me tranquility and you mentioned as we had our nation America\nOr that would be one nation by ...\nIntensifying with the low ... issues whether it's the cabinet off or immigration or Republican or Democrat\nI'm Wondering what nation if as independent state just like when states will make a law of their own\nName we should look at her own United States and say OK currently I'm living in Florida because\nRepublicans have certain philosophy of the way they would like to see things done\nMaybe we should make Florida simply a Republican state Democrats\nHave a certain way with which they like to see things done or whether they care about the environment or support abortion or what have you maybe we should make 'em Texas a democratic state\nAnd maybe if we had each individual state have democratic philosophy for Republican philosophy people that handles philosophies belonging to Democrats or Republicans couldn't live in that state and there wouldn't be all this animosity and great\nWell then as soon as the course of people reached free mobile also assumes that we can simply dictate what state is now granted election returns mayor so indicate a which direction of the state goes but uh the notion of officially establishing some things\nAre and how would you feel in Florida was determined to be the opposite of you what are you going to just pack up and leave\nSure I Would say that there would be more peace and tranquility in a state that whoever supported\nMe they ... they whether it be bought abortion or not for abortion the people living in that state there would be much happier and it wouldn't be in line and much more productive state\nWhere most people have much closer ties to localities and bad I mean you ... quite willing to do move wherever whenever but other people have\nFamilies they have the jobs they have the traditions and and the like and and they would not certainly it would not be all peaceful if suddenly all the Republicans are in\nUh Florida in let's say removed to Georgia or something where you where are you going to do to the point of a gun I mean I mean it it just it honestly Ilene strikes me is just a tad unrealistic really\nAs long as you have a free society now of course if you ah if you didn't have a free society ... be very simple but\nPeople are much more than they used\nTo be non non some are some many or not\nYou know I mean don't you think that's a matter of choice and one's individual white it's kinda like if they don't like it up north because it's cold don't they moved down south\nOh they can but you're talking about the forcibly moving them\nOh no no I'm not saying for removing them it would be hard to move [laughter] well that they're going to be happy where they live well but\nThey're they're going to be more unhappy if they they feel like they've got to leave their view I think would be fine somebody wants to leave Libya others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can choose to me well let's say that would support their value systems are just being or choose to be happy because they don't sided hey\nBut of course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then it's kind of an American viewpoint oh so you know again I'm not sure that I see them as as a solution do draw lessons from it to your um\nThank you and raises an important historical point the United states was\nAs you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the is it the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution was a was a deal that was supposed to allow\nExactly the kind of very very significant differences in a state character\nThat healthy and is talking about so all all of us are look back and are appalled at the at the question of of slavery but we we tend to forget that for example Massachusetts and Connecticut at the time of the founding\nA had established churches and we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of the public character and culture of the states and that didn't mean that anybody was forced to leave those states that just meant that if\nIf you wanted to live in that that kind of a place than than you would live in Massachusetts in Connecticut and if you wanted to live someplace else than you'd you'd probably moved to New York\nAnd um\nIt is\nInteresting that over over the last two hundred years the United states you can say has moved more and more towards a enforced\n... trying to force all the states to be the

Donald Trump as the disruptor of a state's a stale status quo\nAnd the Democrats as the party of open borders impeachment and the pillow see for example one question asked respondents whether they believe the U.S should have an open borders immigration policy or whether it's illegal immigration is just that illegal\nIn the national poll sixty five point three percent of respondents said the latter opposite lose closer to their view only twenty seven point five percent said the former now has a uh the notes on this poll continue the Democratic party does not favor open borders as that

yes this is of\nThe highest positions that our country as a difficult question to answer but I Will say generally speaking that I think we should hold I think we should all those people to a higher standard and I say that because you know I've had\nProbably half a dozen\nJob interviews in my life I'm Thirty years old and I'm usually asked about drug usage\nOr have you ever drank smoke marijuana and\nAnd I think I just think that the people in higher and higher century uh and again I think we should reserve judgment about Mr cabin I'll let the FBI investigation being conducted it'd be completed I Do think there's been an up\nAnd up for a on on the left um I think they are rushing to judgment but [noise] um [noise] it just doesn't seem to me that Mr Kavanaugh's probably\nDownplaying or his\nExtracurricular activities okay I I just think we should yeah so what are completely honest and that's all right so what if he was a party boy when he was in high school and college\nWell did that only boy\nWell tell me a lot of people's party in high school I party school and I do like things that are regrettable but what's the line and I don't know what the answer is I think that if the allegations are about the sexual assault our choice to ah [noise] I Do think that that should be disqualified [noise]\nUh no question if you can prove it but the ... then you get into the the proof problem otherwise\nI Wish I could make up a story about you and say well I set it and therefore you have to prove your innocence it's it's very difficult it's it's very difficult but I I I'm with you I partied in high school I partied in college I got in there are fights when I was in college\nDoes that mean I'm not qualified to hold high office [noise]\nNo I I don't I don't think so I don't think that that [noise] ah yeah I wouldn't mind it up a tweet and I can't remember the the person's name but it's something like what is the drunken loudest behavior of a Seventeen year old I have to tell us about the care to a three year old judge that sort of resonates with me\nYeah um [noise] I think that some point if ... if you're thirty\nYou know at at this point you've grown up you've matured you you're you know you're still young guy my book but you but\nYou're not a kid and and and we mature and grow and the difference between a when you were Eighteen and one and thirty is Knight and day night and day\nSo\nI yeah how do we how do we judge him on what he's done since he's been an adult and I don't know if we can but All right I got hit my my break but thank you very much\nAppreciate the call phone number\nIs eight five five to nine five sixty six hundred how imperfect cannot judge me take\nOff your Saturday here coast to coast nothing but football all day long for\nWell there you go there yeah the the other thing that you're talking about the um uh sanctity of the Supreme Court or the the deniers are talking about the sanctity of the Supreme Court the me too movement just admitted that the woman that accused Bill Clinton of rape\nThey finally believe her college loans and already there are women that accused Clinton of things so I guess that means that for the\nPast eight or those eight years that Clinton was president we had a rapist as president and the White House and that would be okay and then ...\nLook at look at it I'm not even I'm not even going to go that far I'm just going to go with I think the the assumption Bill Clinton was the party boy\nRight yeah okay\nSo if you're a party boy\n[laughter]\nI see where you're going but I Do put I Do put this into two different camps maybe I'm being maybe I'm being wrong here but I I think if you want to elect the party boy you go right ahead but if you want somebody to be appointed to high office is that different\n[noise] okay good point good point so\nThen the question becomes I asked him from the beginning how imperfect since we're all imperfect how imperfect do you can you be before you no longer qualified for certain positions of power\nBecause I I I got an said I'm not trying to sound like I'm you know some wild ... I was a wild kid I'd gotten bar fine [laughter] I got drunk I did all that stuff\nSo does that mean I mean it doesn't take high office to be a talk show host but I'm I'm Serious there is all I was young and I did stupid stuff\nAnd we know that Brett Kavanaugh likes the\nYes he does how much\nBeer does he drank well is that what one of the day when he gets home is it to end up doing anything you know is it south of the bar that would be interesting to me because you know if if the guy has an alcohol issue then I don't know if we want him out of the Supreme Court well all this other stuff\nI'm not making this up you go check it out Ruth Bader Ginsburg everybody was given her a hard time because\nI don't know what it was four or five years ago she fell asleep during one of the state of the union messages ... when President Obama was was then and that they're they are all lined up on the front row in her headed by down she's out\nShe is out and they they were teasing her better afterwards and she looked at them and she's kind of a funny lady and she said well how do you know I was a hundred percent sober that's Ruth Bader Ginsburg [laughter]\nSo\n[noise]\nThe actual employed actually what\nI mean how perfect this Ruth Bader Ginsburg have to be is she a smart lawyer that absolutely is she qualified to be a Supreme Court justice absolutely does she have a drink or two probably I don't know maybe maybe they should be part of the past is how many how many drinks do you have\nJust closed on this as a glass\nCourse they'll go through as much hassle Kevin Clarence Thomas ... to ...\nWill they will they in the future has this changed the process because I uh I'm look you look at it I've got I've got everybody's talking about well you know if if Ken rug it's only going to be a ... generally going back to the corporate generations know judges come and go they die they retire\nI'm looking Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she's going to stay till she's ... she's eighty

ago so they've been doing it for at least that long I was in a Walmart one time\nAnd I wasn't even there to shop for a reason I was just there with a family so I said hey I'm going to look at the TVs and I was just browsing the TV yeah\nYeah I came home that night and I got on my computer and I'm used to seeing the pop ups\nYou know some things that I've looked at or bought I'm you know I'm cool with that but right or wrong man all my pop ups changed immediately that evening\nTo visit your TV ha ha ha from Walmart wow I thought I\nThought oh it's my phone my phone had the GPS tracking me but I had left my phone at home that night so the only way and so anyway I Googled and started looking around and sure enough there was a partnership between Facebook and a Wal Mart just start doing that so they you know they they take your picture and then they match it up with\nSomething a little Wal Mart or else knew all more your photo and then they scan it through Facebook and they go bingo which John we know who he is\nYeah wow yeah\nAnd that's that was a year and a half ago so imagine what they're doing today\nA look at I Won the whole an essay thing came out about the fact that there are only you know\nGetting our our what what's the data that they get to some sort of data or you know I I I didn't like it at all did not like it at all I did it to me it violates the constitutional

to Walmart and looking at the TV says this is about making sure we know who is getting on airplanes\nThe security thing does that change your mind\nYou know I'm I'm kind of undecided on that because I'll be the last person to say that I really trust the government more than I trust anybody else but I mean I I Know their intentions are good and I think maybe functionally could do something well but I still don't know that I'm On board with it yeah\nWell I uh along those lines I'm with you I I've always thought if you're flying on a United Airlines United should have a gate where you go

S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer\nBut it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries are is modernize you give us Americans a better deal and uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage on other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this deal so there you got me on that one that's not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan a show I mean I agree with you on that\nOne song on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for a candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just by the way it's just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of it you know as you know we've talked about this on your show before more and more of what Americans producers called intellectual property we produce\nComputer software we produce Patton sent copyrights and and ah technologies and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and something and certainly China and and and many other countries in Asian countries they just steal ever watch real property and this new I'm now ... has very strongly that this new uh I'll call it\nIt's better protections for not an American intellectual property so countries are going to use our products they actually pay for them\nEven more is my guest and he served as a ton of economic advisor to President Trump between sixteen campaign Steven you recall President Obama famously saying these jobs aren't coming back what magic wand does a president have what do you think people who felt that way feel right now about this deal\nWell first of all you know what to look for Obama was referred to as you said you know he can't get us to four percent economic growth and they can't bring manufacturing jobs in construction stacked with his country and they kept bringing coal jobs back and maybe maybe Donald\nTrump that was that I have a magic wand because we do\nWe do have a just since the election one million additional construction manufacturing and mining jobs and this happened Larry because it's things you talk about every night on your show we lower the burden\nOf taxation we lower the burden of regulation we allow companies to do their thing got government off the back of our businesses and you know the twenty seven million\nSmall businessmen and women in this country\nRespond to that and they are hiring more people I don't know if you saw the news today that uh\nThat uh one of the major um\nAmazon I Believe it was they're going to raise the wages to Fifteen dollars an hour I don't want the government to tell companies to do that but they're doing it because it's a tight labor market the economy is booming it's hard to get workers uh this is exactly what we tried to do when we put this plan together Larry Kudlow and I for Donald Trump two years ago\nStephen Moore is my guest he's an economist even take the last minute and talk to us about about debt and about the tournaments program but even Obama said we're an automatic climate or this president has done a lot of things we talked about the tax cuts the regulatory relief speeds also spent money especially on defense into our debt has increased are you worried about that\nWell you shouldn't be but I'll tell you one statistic about you know because the economy is doing so well now I mean you know we've had two straight quarters now four percent growth I mean Obama never got us you know the last year he was present at one point six percent that additional growth\nBut according to the latest congressional budget office for cash has increased that ten year a economic output energy the GDP by ... trillion dollars now the government's going to get what Seventeen Eighteen percent of that that is one trillion dollars in additional tax revenues right there we always believe that one of the best first tools\nAnd reducing our dad autonomy get people back to work get people off welfare and and so far that's going really well so we have any kind of you know you're right we have not cut the entitlements because neither party wants to do that\nIt's even more thank you so much for coming on I appreciate is always okay there we come back\nKevin after some ice melt you're listening to the

judicial fight that ultimately went to the Supreme Court and McConnell the SEC where he sued the federal government\nOver the McCain Feingold\nCampaign finance laws um and lost five four\nAnd you know if ever you want to have a sense for how important are the Supreme Court is you could lose five for the Supreme Court and so you know he's dedicated the last Fifteen\nYears to making sure that they have the most conservative judiciary possible and of course that has gone through many iterations taking us through Merrick Garland and everything else to where we are today\nI Want you here with the president said that I don't think it's helpful to Mitch McConnell but you might know different cut to\nThirty six years this this I had one [noise]\nOh you think it was always wonder\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago and\nSo and so it was really the first time he's been remarkably disciplined over the last two weeks but not last night doesn't matter\nIf it's not my favorite stuff for sure but but I also understand that frustration you know you look at the New York times every day and you got a new report we know that Brett Kavanaugh throws ice we know that he writes letters student's roommates caught on the ... of noxious drunks we've tried to assassinate his\nCharacter and every English in every paper and English speaking language and yet nobody has done a simple property\nCheck on on Dr Ford or any of the people who've come forward and\nAccused Brett Kavanaugh of everything from from\nGang rape to being at a tawdry parties so I understand that frustration and I think highlighting some of those inconsistencies is inevitable it's also part of the reasons why this process should never gotten here in the first place you the kind of allegations\nThat you've ... behind closed doors and the Judiciary Committee often does to make sure that you protect noxious the accused but the accuser hey you know and you know what\nI'm Wondering Josh or the one thing about Democrats in less it was a safe vote for example we did invite for the Senate deal the Iranian deal because it was a bad deal with the presidents and you don't have to worry about it I'm going to implement it anyway I mean President Obama\nBut for the most part the Democrat stuck together and I wouldn't say they just no matter if they're a moderate liberals are most are on the left they'll stick together Republicans never have that\nMitch McConnell's always doing was mccaskey encounter major issues there's always a problem with an anti Trump or whether it's been sass or in this case or a Jeff Flake and I remember during the Bush years who send a Lugar sometimes in others who would take on President Bush of the things why is it hard for the Republicans tonight\nWill Democrats don't have moderate you know kind of like a\nFun little retrospect to hearken back to the days of of\nPresident Kennedy and others who had you know more of a moderate ideology but now you look at the Democratic party and Elizabeth Warren find yourself in the mainstream you know this is this is a party that derives its energy from\nAbolish ice in a peach President Trump and some of the most radical ideas that you can come up with in in American government and so you know what the Republican part why love if everybody agreed on everything absolutely but I'm also Greg glad that they got a big enough tent where we can appeal\nTo the whole faith based on where they live\nYou know these people can be won over that's where it used to be a Leslie Josh other part of the United states might have been one of the most significant things they got just buried ... really the president's fault\nAnd that is redoing NAFTA us MCA whatever it's called a ... but it's done and I just had I talked to a dairy farmer on television and hour ago or ... praise this deal\nThis is unbelievable this is a worker former delivery is if the president promised and delivered\nTotally incredible and it's the first time any president and even try right I mean we've heard\nFrom the Democratic party and particularly over the last Thirty years every campaign cycle is about how bad NAFTA is our shipping jobs overseas until President Trump and branches that agenda and that every Democrat talks about a great NAFTA is and and the bottom line is the first president is actually a rolled up his sleeves and went to work at trying to make a make it better for\nAmerican workers across the country right like he set includes farmers liquids manufacturing includes all the the tenets of the American economy that had been really neglected for a whole lot of years\nJust have to find a way I mean they should be easy but they have a hard time packaging their success or they seem to be on the good good fighting back against the taxes they think are just\nLet's see if that changes I Know you help get Mitch McConnell reelected in twenty fourteen and he wants to hold on to the Senate and his power Josh Holmes thanks so much\nThank you so much appreciate abroad go get them a one eight six six for all eight seven six six on I'm going to talk to you in just a moment you're on your on the line your next and give it away to build better check books written by Ian O'Connor\n\nWhere the upper Cumberland talks news talk Ninety four point one where the upper Cumberland teams taught high school playbook sixty minutes of exercising does sixty minutes of football in high school playbook\nAm fascinated we're not making the headline of this perjury situation at the letter of his ex wife and I think it's like she needs to get many people especially the women that tell are holding out they're about to go look\nAt the ... the big deal and I'm just going to stick with Kavanaugh I'm I don't understand why there\n... leading line you're talking about the accuser number three sweat Nick\nNo I'm Talking about the ex boyfriend of Mrs for he said I watched her administer polygraph test the perjury herself\nShe yeah that you're right she did she did to help a friend because she's a she's a therapist or psychologists his PHD she did help her friend and coach your friend through a polygraph test and she answers and no I've never done that she did\nAnd you know she knows how to pass one obviously and that was would I guess the prosecuting attorney maybe new that ahead of time I'm not sure but I'm sure they did ask the question so he he's the president did go after sweat next attorney he obviously does not like ... and I don't blame him I don't either country\n[noise]\nWell it turned out\nEven NBC who is as bad as they can\nEven be secretly shelter where that is if you did you see that as\nSoon as she when she did is she gives his story how she saw him a a teenage Brett Kavanaugh\nStand by a punch bowl any new found out later that these punch bowls were spike so she didn't see him spike the punch bowl with quite lose or any type of liquor but he was standing by their he didn't do anything in terms of solving that he knows of but\nHe was in a group he wasn't in a line for groups actually was in a group or huddled around a room that had group sex in it she sadly is assaulted if it was indeed true but people around her including a parents don't really believe it now on the earlier topic on the polygraph\nFormer FBI assistant director for intelligence Kevin Brock talked to Shannon last night about these claims of forward training of friends for the polygraph test ...\nIt is standard polygraph to have one or two operative questions that are asked um so but\nIf somebody wants to look at the recordings I Want to see how the question was framed they want to hear what the actual answers were [noise] um but I Will say my experience that I've dealt with political first both from the FBI and those who are hired privately [noise] um [noise]\nWhen you hire a Pulitzer for you get what you pay for that's been my experience as a simple as that uh nobody should be surprised that an outcome of a polygraph uh from somebody that you hire largely comports with the outcome you're looking for\nBecause they know what I ask the questions and she knows how to ask questions now we know she was helping a friend passed one [noise]\nSo do you see the problem ... if she sexual assault is terrible but if she was cost your phobic that's not true it doesn't seem that you couldn't ... she lived in a five hundred foot square apartment five hundred feet with one entrance that according to a boyfriend of six years\nShe's not afraid to fly she lied about that\nNot afraid to fly lately\nHere and we don't really shows no when he came when he left out so there's a huge problem with the story you know how I Know Michelle they're now looking at ... temperament and the hearing that's how I Know\nHow far polygraph what yet they're now true or false I care that he lied under oath and it started she died\nAll right thanks Michele Richard in Montreal Richard you disagree with me you think it was a good move for the president to start ripping her last night on stage in Mississippi\nYes I thought it was an excellent idea he pointed out all her life these aren't inconsistencies are bleeding lies and all these journalists who continue to say how credible she is and they're not even on the other networks are not even reporting about her ex boyfriends letter and it's quite a while I was going to report that on Fox\nNews Sunday he likes to cover up everything to now he doesn't like to cover up following covers up plenty of things I I don't know I don't think he's covered up I really don't\nThink that he did a report that the the [noise] anyway it covered he's not going to report this he covers everything up the attacks from day and night and I'm tired of it that's why he's always up with ... Smith the ship Smith hates President Trump how come I never see Chris Wallace on Sean Hannity's show\nUm he doesn't do the nighttime shows he does Tucker and he does shot and um he tries to stay off the opinion shows she does because he does not want to be listed as a Republican or Democrat host it doesn't do any good\nAre these people who could Chuck Todd and they go he's left you know they look at which I actually think the new hosted Margaret Brennan on face the nation is pretty fair I Do or this week a joy to have an apple is when people see George\nBut by the questions or to Chris Wallace his goal is to say tough questioner that's it he's ... he's not going to be afraid to go after you\nSo I Know what frustrates people but I Do say I I don't know anybody who doesn't think Chris is fair but I Know that some people think they maybe he should be easier on the president I I kind of like his Tony it helps me get ready for this year\nThey listened W.

line some people say condescending other people say straight truth as in\nTrump said black community in this country\nMight as well live in Afghanistan here I'm paraphrasing but it's that Afghanistan is a direct quote\nThat things are worse in the black community than they are in Afghanistan because of poverty violence in the street you know Chicago Brian people shooting each other in a bad schools all the rest are and he said well what do you have to lose why don't why are you voting for Hillary Clinton and not for me right so this was like such a powerful question\nAnd the book is an answer here Mr Trump is what we have to lose but I Would begin by saying this to Mr receptive Mr kill me\nThat he distorted the reality of what it is to be black in America in twenty Eighteen\nAt a time when forty percent of the black population this country's making between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars twelve percent a hundred to two hundred thousand I saw a clear majority of black America\nIs in the middle class or beyond so these are striving people given what obstacles exist historically slavery legal discrimination ongoing biased especially in the public's the private sector\nI Would think boy what a great American story people who at times have had some difficulties been denied equal opportunity but believe in American the American dream\nInstead President Trump presents black the black community as something for the white community to spare someone's gonna mug you or the twenty percent than living in poverty that defines a whole bunch of them\nOne did President Obama take your stats and paint a positive picture\nYes much more in other words and by the way\nI don't know what I interpreted from him I said quote one speech but that's not what I got

business now well weekly show with local people focused on business work with local entrepreneurs Johnny sites and celebrated business author\nSo I was very troubled by the the tone of the remarks uh the initial defense that a judge Kavanaugh gave a ... was something\nLike I told my wife I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members\nWere sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nIs that is it doesn't sound like he's on board yet\nAll I can say is they were coming after him and he was absolutely\nRight Kavanaugh is absolutely right in the sense that this was a coordinated campaign designed by innuendo and false representation\nTo smear the guy's reputation including accusations of gang rape\nMean anybody that would not be upset in fact Brian\nI remember one Michael Dukakis was asking the debate what would you do if somebody murdered his wife or something terrible what would you do and he gave his kind of bland and emotional response he got pilloried for that and here's a guy that comes out swinging when people are swinging at him and he's getting pilloried for that I think he's a human being\nPosted I'm with you and the thing is to if you're somebody in society that's working their way up and then somebody ... it's tough enough but when you break Cather you spent the last thirty plus years living is a very laudable life\nOn and off on the job in off the job\nAnd they want to go back to the Nineteen eighties and call you a gang rapist and drunk\nAnd you watch your kids and you see them get upset and you watch your parents and you see a humiliated they are and you wonder what happened in my life I was about to get the most prestigious job in America and now I have to worry that my integrity might be last forever I thoroughly get it but the fact that people are talking about this now\nTemperament and they're talking about high school drinking does that also show you they have nothing else\nThey've got nothing else for one thing I take a little bit of a different take on it the people coming after him with their questions were being highly partisan again using innuendo to attempt to do exactly what you are saying\nDestroy his reputation he could either ignored it either pretend they weren't bi partisan they weren't using innuendo and miss truce to tarnish him or he could come right back out on um mine gosh at some point you just got a call people out for what they're doing I think he was calling them out\n... you know you're a doctor first you did this political thing is that this is the last ... one of the last phase of your career this supposed to be given back in your mind\nSo I understand your frustration you talk like a real person or

over the fact\nAnd then they thought well he got yelled at in the elevator and he was overcome with emotion he didn't want women to think that he was ignoring the allegations of sexual assault so he called for this FBI investigation Republicans had no choice but listen to why he did it listen\nTo Senator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running out of ... and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp two parties there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nI thought he was doing what was right now he's talking about currency and value in politics if he was staying on the job like you wore he would never done what he did what does that make you think about the authenticity here\nUm let's just say that if you think if you think something is right you do and it's important you do it no matter what including no matter what the electoral politics period ending story and that's what you're elected for and every now and you take a vote and you still have to explain it and I may not be able to explain it well but that's what you do\nAnd so I'm going to disagree with Senator Flake no ... for his position that may be the case but also for I'm I'm the better way would be it was important is the right thing to do I'm taking the boat and let's see what the consequences or by the way I think John McCain did that on numerous occasions\nI obviously he did that and he got under George Bush's skin and he got under a obviously Donald Trump's skin a lot and he also went after President Obama when he thought he was wrong especially on foreign policy so the big thing in Washington now and it probably in New York who knows could happen to me tomorrow\nIs all these protesters disturbing everyday life people trying to do their jobs or spend time with their families or or a loved ones we saw with Ted Cruz last week\nWe saw it with a we saw with kerosene Nielsen we saw with Sarah Huckabee Sanders and that's just off the top of my head Mitch McConnell at the airport and then member Jeff Flake got harassed right here on friday listen\n\nI we we know what happened he didn't say a word or he was he was saying you know she was obviously something horrible happened to her and she was taking out and Jeff Flake but listen to what happened to let everybody here what happened when you got confronted by a protester list\nFor having\nEveryone there\n\nAre you OK the person to go ahead no charges for\nTo\n\nAnd that's what she got a full FBI investigation center Cassie you actually you worry about being politically correct you actually are actually engaged the issue in the protest her she was not ready for that\nI Am being politically correct Brian because by golly give our country gets to the point where an accusation can destroy somebody which everyone who is there a sense isn't true I can tell you that everybody in our country is subject to being destroyed and that is a tyranny and we cannot tolerate tyranny\nAnd and do you did you did you know have you been harassed by protesters I hear they're crawling all over the uh the Capitol building\nUm but on the other hand a it is time to push back it is time to push back on people that think that um collaborated accusations are enough to destroy a life lived a above reproach up until these uncorroborated accusations\nUm and if we don't do that prime they're coming after everybody a there is no there is no stop as to as to how this weapon works\nYou know that the president brought up the other day in fact he said it last night at the rally cut five\nThat's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty or is it very very very difficult time [noise]\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of a Supreme Court just [noise] it really does this brown you are certainly guilty until proven innocent\nAnd Chris Coons said as much the president recognize this do you think we're talking about something even bigger than this\nTotally by the way this is a this to the left or just started going to this they went up to Nikki Haley saying girls things about Nikki Haley\nUm and so somehow um they're going to charge again in ... to rumors as a way to discredit people on the right um and you can't prove a negative so of course you say it how do you just proven negative um uh the Christians and others know better than that but there's just a taxi to destroy\nI tend to Cassie give me your prediction ... have you heard that the FBI report is in will you be one of the senators had read it carefully\nAbsolutely um I really carefully because I have no doubt his company misrepresented by those on the left\nAnd we have to be able to speak for protecting the identity of those who testified are thinking that there'll be speaking confidentially you got to respect them but nonetheless I if if people on the left are going to be ... be misrepresenting the people who are right need to be able to set the record straight\nSo then the procedure would be if it comes in today you have a cloture vote tomorrow and then you could vote on ... the tomorrow will be Thursday coach a vote on friday and then you'd actually have a floor vote on Saturday\nTo thirty hours and so whenever that runs out whatever time it's first filed it was filed at ten o'clock at night on friday a Sunday Morning that sort of thing\nAnd we ... center Cassie or would you talk personally Centre College Murkowski and make your case\nYou know we are having we're regularly scheduled lunches and there is a group discussion\nAnd they fully participate I have great respect for my colleagues and I speak other speak but we speak to a group we're not ... anybody we're speaking to a group respecting the need for folks to come to a decision I think the process is working very well\nDo you think will all we should all see that recipe I report\nA if you could one let's face it a Kavanaugh's meant smeared and\nAs Mitch McConnell says the first one of the obituary will refer

Joe dot com welcome back Hi Ryan so you started this whole thing with your interviewer Brett Kavanaugh yeah\nI mean it's a remarkable alright what a week um as a you know I felt I feel like the Brett Kavanaugh that I spoke to um that Monday morning last Monday\nThe Brett Kavanaugh that was on Thursday was kind of simmering loaded beneath the surface he was obviously very upset very stressed out very uh intensely concerned about this entire situation what it was during his family\nBut he's trying to keep a lid on it and I feel like by Thursday he had been advised or maybe it was his own decision to let that led just pop off and that's what we saw in there\nA obviously a but people are saying that he went over the top and they're worried about his temperament now among them is somebody who really has to win over and that is Jeff Flake cook Thirteen\nSo I was very troubled by the the tone of the remarks or the initial defense to George ... capital gave ... was something\nOr or told my wife I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I were if I felt that I was unjustly middle maligned but then it went on the interaction with the members were short and partisan and the concerns me\n[noise] so where do you think flake is with that [noise]\nWell I I'm going to say that I think is still open minded um\nI talked to him about this last night he believes that Jeff Flake is still open minded\nUm but he was clearly disturbed by judge Kavanaugh as a performance and I and you know he's especially in some pretty clearly tried to walk back a little bit after that it said I was talking about the judge I was talking about the whole situation\nI think it's grossly unfair no matter where you stand on this to come after him for his temperament and that hearing if he had gone in there all controlled like he was on Monday morning people would say he has no passion if you were accused well how could you just sit there and answer the questions like that\nThere's no satisfying some people on this issue clearly and you know when you look back at what Clarence Thomas said to that Judiciary Committee he was as angry as Brett Kavanaugh was their different people so it's expressed in different ways but he went after them and slammed them\nFor their political edition of his process in no uncertain terms and nobody is saying that judge that Judge Thomas shouldn't have been serving on the court all these years\nUm I I think it's grossly unfair and I also think given as judicial history it's it's very unfair to suggest that because he has personal feelings about what he's been through that he's going to throw all that are out the window as a judge because we've already seen over the past twelve years on the circuit court\nThat he has a very um appropriate judicial temperament so you know I\nDon't know I don't think that some people would be happy with his response either way\nAre you telling you have a son in college I Do are you telling him right now if he screws up these not going to give them the Supreme Court [noise] have you told him you know that's one of my sons\nAbout this and them and my daughter as well to be honest it it's it's really incredible when I look at my younger son um who is about the age that Brett Kavanaugh was is when these ah charges have been leveled against him back then to think that you could be [noise] have something from that far back come on\nYou did on beach week thirty four years ago Murtha sticking around break you'll meet Joe phone calls next\nNews talk Ninety four point one they are the early riser so hardworking neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for the next\nMentioned it to anyone until twenty twelve and then it came out in the therapist discussions and that it's in the notes so that that's consistent with her story that she didn't share it with him in the late nineties\nYeah so that is uh something that popped up and now we also understand too quickly to the boyfriend\nThe ex boyfriends deserve an axe to grind the doctor for it helped a friend of hers prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how public gross work then help with clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam when asked did you did have you ever take one or prepare for 'em before she said she\nHadn't yeah ... I mean that if that if his story is true that potential for lying under oath and that was interesting question when it came up when the prosecutor asked that question did you ever health anywhere from ... I thought she where she's coming from here and now it appears that perhaps they had you know some of that testimony that led to that question I thought that was very interesting so with\nThis next story is fascinating because I've been out of who feels like he's on a roll with Stormy Daniels which is an odd thing to say it feels like I got another client and this guy's going to blow everything up\nYeah she did a her credibility she goes out there and says well your your your Brett Kavanaugh was by the punch bowl did he spike it no\nDon't know it was standing there at though handing solo cups around standing there at handling girls drinks who came to the party to go to a party I Would assume\nAnd then she stood outside a doorway when there was group sex going on and he might have been somebody who has a reminder of\nImage she's got so many ... and she was asked you know why are we at this party when you're in college and they were in high school and she said oh there were people of all ages there from like Eighteen Fifteen to like twenty five I think she said you know and then I I mean it's just so her story has so many holes in it it's incredible I I Can't figure out\nAnd then he said oh can you know some of your friends who are with you there verify that you were there and NBC called all four of the friends they couldn't get one of them to verify her story\nOr Alan Dershowitz was on he said that I think that a break capital should be confirmed but he wanted to see an FBI investigation first Kevin ... streaks she speaks he says I think they're I think he's in it you know as soon as you've been confirmed but I still want to see the FBI investigation\nAnd I would start and I didn't know where it's coming from the time which what Nick that's the third accuser furtherance of why ...\nI think the FBI to investigate every single one of her claims and if it turns out if it turns out\nThat she made it up out of whole cloth that she never met Kavanaugh that she was several years old and that she along with others or by herself\nSimply made up a story the FBI should conclude that she should be tried for perjury and she should be sent to prison this becomes a very important education moment and because we have to teach the women of the world and the men of the world\nThat there is no genetically linked aspect of telling the truth\nI think that he makes an excellent point and I think this is what we all need to get back to the idea that all women should be believed is a false premise we need to strip away gender from questions of truth\nIt doesn't matter who's the man and who's the woman in these toys what matters is who's telling the truth and you know there's a lot that we still need to discover there's a ton of these stories out there but if you strip away you are at least on the right course to figuring out where the truth lies\nAnd I think that's where we're at a now when Donald Trump junior was asked the question are you more worried for your son or your daughter about this in the future he says no doubt for my son's here's what Donald Trump senior should cut it\nThere's just a time when your father\nOne your husband or your brother when your son\nA terrible thing just a person was never meant that I just things that will horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do\nThem sad situation I think you're right\nAnd who do you worry about more your your daughter or your\nYou know what I worry about them equally when it comes to this and I would say that one of the big lessons for young women from this whole thing\nIs as hard as it is if something happens to you you need to document it right away you need to tell people what happened do you need to tell your parents you need to tell the police you need to have whatever evidence you can possibly grow up in that situation\nTo prove beyond a reasonable doubt that what you say happened to you that is my message for young women and I think it's a very important\nFor young men they need to be extraordinarily careful because we're living in a time in this meat you moment where the pendulum has swung too far and where an accusation becomes an indictment and that is not the judicial system that we live in in this country\nExactly a and by the way the other thing I Want to go to Theresa W okay the business in other words you wanted to bring up with your Theresa Martha ... so you're getting said first show with seven o'clock you want to talk of the protesters\nWith them is like with the women have accused him like the protests are in the um elevator just because she\nWants to come out there and screen everyone thinks oh my gosh something bad happened to her how do we know that I feel like\nI Believe the liberals when they said they will do what ever it takes to keep a Trump appointee off the bench what makes anybody think that these women\nAre the type of people that could do that because we saw that on TV we saw all the women wearing the Johnny when you saw what they were doing and we heard what they were saying I mean there was a woman\nI Can't remember what ... was she was on the TV talking about very gross things that go along with women's bodies every month and it's almost like they were wanting to blame all men I just\nDon't get it right or they come out and they say that this happened to me we don't know that\nAll right I I Would say the either yawn that we don't know whether or not you know the women in the elevator went through these experiences I'm going to see and they did I I I think they probably did\nUm but their experience does not translate to this situation\nThese crimes are individual crimes they are not a broad brush that you see all men with each one of them it needs to be determined on its validity and so you know Jeff Flake and Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Christine afford\nTheir situation that they're all determining the truth is completely separate from every other one of the situation I was Bill Cassidy do when he was confronted yesterday listen\nThe more ... for some\nEveryone they're the\n\nFor you okay as a person to go ahead [laughter] no criminal charges for\nMore\nTo your son is\nI hadn't heard that exchange that's really remarkable\nAnd it's a it's a very evident of what's going on and it's not you know I ... and it's very interesting also to see the president tapping into this about you know your son and her husband because that that's a very bold strategy to president never shies away from saying that he something that he thinks is tapping into what a lot of people are feeling in the country\nBut I Do think that men are the majority of which are good and and don't spend their time assaulting are attacking women feel under siege I and we're actually going to a men's pound tonight we did a women's paint on the other night uh for moms\nAnd we had people on both sides of the fence who felt that you know Kavanaugh was was guilty and and other women who said that you know that they didn't feel like the charges have been proven\nTo never going to talk to men are about how they feel about about this issue\nGreat ah Martha ... going

Mart or self employed or why K.\nK. it allows him as a ... one person entity to have\nAn ultra low cost plan like he worked for a fortune five hundred company it's the weirdest thing but one person company gets a better four O. one K. than a two hundred person company and they change\nIt's because for the soul or self employed four one K. the rules were so streamlined that you can go to any of my really low cost companies that I Love\nOh one K. and use their absolute lowest cost investments\nTo go in that self employed four one K. and the limits are very high for the money and put in the advantage of the ... though is there's no paper work I mean it's like half a page and your husband in a year that things go really well can contribute roughly a quarter\nOf his revenue to the south

wanted to see how that can be guided by well though\nOh is either either can be done with the robo investing very can't yeah it's just the robo investing organization would have to\nOffer a self

you pick a portfolio and they handle the mix of investing for you it's a a free version of robo investing\nOkay and he could do the self employed are so low four one K. and that might be a great option for him but either just doing either\nIs what's so outstanding either the so low four one K. or this up they're both winners\nCharles is with us on the Clark Howard show how Charles how are you doing\nJust fine how are you great thank you you're giving advice to a family member is that true or friend\nWell advice but also just hoping to make arrangements myself and stumbled into a challenge trying to help someone to get a rental car out of state um there's seems to be a few places where you can prepare for cars\nBut and almost all cases they require you to present the card that you use to repay rental at the rental desk when you pick it up\nWe would see you're renting a car you're paying for it but somebody else who's going to be driving the car in a whole nother state\nRight trying to help an analog get to towns the Christmas for example and just was\n... and you're asking to climb a a hill that it's going to be very hard to climb [laughter] industry is not set up for that\nBecause of all the problems that they have with stolen cars right and so all so you would be taking on an enormous liability risk\nIf you are the winner of record in someone else's an additional driver so the whole purpose of this is to get this individual to you is it cheaper than having them fly 'cause usually flying is cheaper\nWhen it's when we're trying to to get several people now in children and and Christmas gifts\nAnd all of that so uh what car would probably be the easiest [noise] ah I don't know if it matters but I'm I was actually looking into renting it and their name with them being the rent or just trying to fill up eight the transaction\nBut even in that case they have to present a card to the rental agency now the the way that I could think of so they have no credit card is that right\nThey do but for just ... they don't have a lot of room on there\nThey're trying to help 'em out you're going to pay for it right okay so that's how you do it\nRight so what you do is instead of trying to rent it on your card or anything like that you make a pre payment on their credit card so that they go into a negative balance so they have a room available on their credit limit\nRight whatever the estimate of the rental is going to be and then they have the room on the card to rent it when their cart gotcha and then you are women ate the liability risk that you're making my heart beat too fast [laughter]\nI understand all that's a good idea I should have thought of that that's that's pretty straightforward\nAnd so you don't want to pay the credit card company too far in advance of when the rental is gonna be 'cause some credit card companies as we've had caller say if you over pay or whatever that they\nThey send you a check for it but if you like ten days out that should work perfectly gotcha and allow the relative to rent the car\nTerrific well that that does not like the solution I appreciate the help\nAll right well you have a great day and a great holiday ... to ... park David with us on the Clark Howard show hello David Clarke how you doing great thank you you are a Nissan Leaf driver\nYes I Am actually and a great car\nSo let me tell you the deal I bought it when they had a really good rebate on it and all that actually released it for two years coming up on the end is Elise Hi at this point the cars essentially cost me nothing because the government tax credits pretty much paid for the lease payment to this point so I I Want to buy the car\nOr the problem I'm having is it's worth on the open market probably seven thousand Seventy five hundred dollars and the residuals Fifteen thousand so cautious number one is I Will do I do I just go to a ... or ... some thousand dollar\nExactly exactly because they don't want your leaf back\nSo you go to them and you offer um market value and if Nissan tells you to get lost that it's Fifteen thousand or nothing you say I'm going to get lost here's your car back\nAnd then leave says you've seen are widely available on the use vehicle market for six to eight thousand dollars depending on the mileage and the year and the condition and you just turn around and and buy another one by used one\nRather than have one that you had known and driven for the two years it'd be better if you could buy the one you have David 'cause you know its history you're the one who created that history\nRight so and that's the other side of it you always say when you buy used car get it checked out by a mechanic but [laughter] where do you go to find a leak mechanic they don't you don't do anything because you know there's there's simply no maintenance on electric\nCars are the only thing you would have a leaf checked out for his best I can tell is the remaining battery life you know that meter on the right hand side where show right below the empty he'd want to check that and the other thing is you'd want to have it checked out by a body shop\nTo see if it had been in Iraq other than that you'd be good to go as long as the the battery has not degraded too much and it hadn't been in Iraq\nIt's just a matter of which color leave you want to drive and by ultra cheap you're

the summer probably August after birds\nYou know\nI'm not doing a I'm not leaving my pregnant wife and four kids halfway around the world and go live with your dad not a chance are more than her up and move and do as you can you can have your family help you a little bit of animal costs much to get move maybe the employer would give the new employer would give you an advance to get you moved into your new apartment\nUm there's a possibility with the you know you need a load up your family and get out of there\nYou know not being with your pregnant wife while she's carrying what your ... child you're in Boston and she's in Montana dude it's not okay [laughter]\nI mean you're not in the military you're not you're not required to be separated like that you're just making bad joy says no you need you need to scrape together a few dollars and go deliver some pizzas or something and uh for a month and and ... you know thousand Fifteen hundred bucks and get you are you home and get your button gear\nAnd enroll loan over to a Boston and take a job\nOr moving with your dad for a month with the whole dead gum crew over there you can something like that I mean you need to find a different way but this idea you're going to lay bringing your whole family\nAnd while your wife is getting no no no that's not going to work out for you it's gonna end poorly on diminish or your they links for going in men is one of those bands in Colorado Springs hey Ben how're you\nOther than I deserve what's up there I Am\nSelf employed I'm a real estate agent and we've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps wide\nAnd art but they were were kind of a crossroads on how to how to go up to about going on with the next babysat I'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan\nThat you know because I'm self employed and money isn't always the air I Need to have oh you know two two months or so of income to fall back on in ... to be able to make the budget\nThat does your wife work but if she does not she's a stay at home mother and so you're not make any money in the real estate business well I mean I'm making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year somewhere in there they are not having zero months\nNot any zero a month or during the winter in Colorado there's um a month they're slower than others where you know making the making the budget that would be tight tighter than where we're at ... I'm\nNot I don't I don't I never expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly vulnerable and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call it an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it a hill in the valley account\nThe hill and valley is the volatility of your income the hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month but\nDude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if he told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you have in some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues and charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are than okay since some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have\nA volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle hey mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYeah thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you I had a great impact on changed my life five years ago um do you think you are currently I I I got a critic question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my ... got a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that they come out as working for a very similar culture\nYeah I went to a competitor a much more of your making a making a eighty thousand dollars a year what do you make now\nI make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year on your question is what\nI make my question is I really missed a small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work\nAnd um you know I show up to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worth in the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company can't tell you but if you could probably find somebody whether these are folks are\nAnd how you what your worst\nThis is the remedy\nThat you know statistically when it comes to life insurance or protecting your family that women are more likely to be on insured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nAnd in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day this is one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning maybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or the need to replace family care\nIs equally important for women\nAs it is for men single moms working moms are stay at home moms all need term life insurance\nRates are actually lower for women which is why I send your designed or insurance they shop the top term life companies to find the lowest rates available you can compare rates online at ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two this is something every family has to deal with that ... gum\nThey treat you like crap and they over charging for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings their Web banking systems are\nNot any more sophisticated they're not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nAnd I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and I kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but\nYou know ... you know in most of these cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing\nJust the same how can I help\nBy ... thank you and your staff you're doing it it's a blessing thank you um how will be needing a life saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I ah I should continue funding NHL stay with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks here of course they just put that extra money into a Roth IRA her four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year a company I don't know who you can put you can hold their matching a couple hundred bucks a year in more okay\nShow the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what is it\nFinding deliver ooh I got the so yeah fortunately if you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know out okay how I'd say it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they asked a mate that you know Seventeen years out so okay I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know if I\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... you you you got to have the cash in your age essay or somewhere else in an investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nThat if I don't retire um then I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is I guess this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably yeah yeah\nSo I'm thinking we're going to term retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cobra but the cover only last what two years or something\nUm I don't know you can keep that indefinitely so I I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of those I don't want to time that poorly ah but then how much have you got coming\nI thought I was always a year end of that age essay or whatever your big adoptable is what your doctor will\n[noise] um [noise] ...\nYeah you or whatever that adoptable is on the ... year\nOh now the age I say that health insurance I Know of fun I don't\nKnow the edge essays are health savings account that is attached to a health an H essay health insurance policy that as a ... policy\nIt it depends uh depends on a policy I pick to either six to nine nine thousand\nWhat I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year end of that savings account\nThat would be six thousand out early on that yes and I don't touch it until I you know pre higher\nYes here's why out when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you keep your health insurance in place and you've got\nThis big juicy health savings account sitting there in and I use mutual funds in it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as it can there's no downside of that whatever you

Reno Hi Shay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDay thanks for taking my call today sure what's up\nI'm On the health insurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it we adopted our two children about three years ago\nAnd they came from the foster care system so we don't get a lot of services but one thing we do get is health insurance until they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system\nAnd every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise] time of year to make that decision\nOkay um what would his employer's plan cover that Medicaid is not covering\nAll they've both been healthy thankfully I guess or um you know the thing we always come back to is unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may however\nMany services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know and a lot of ways a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had you know minimal minimal\nIncident afraid if they had some kind of a major event that he'll Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know a scraping a bump and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a state than we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a um there's a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and I and\nYou are you know in November we can make a biohazard you uh uh you know free food stamps because you are adopted a foster child you know that would feel the same way as what you're saying um it would\nYeah I mean I well I don't look at you and he has to be able to get up and that takes care of their you know their their financial needs and um so I don't know this is not an easy now don't use a question and does it cost to add them to your husband's policy\nUm I think it would be nothing given the policy Ron has a high deductible each has a plan that we have and there's no cost ... and Emily\nAnd why is it a question if it doesn't cost anything and it's better coverage\nThat's a good answer there probably isn't a as an\nQuestion I guess the only question would be just changing jobs in the future if he were to believe that you know you know go somewhere else\nYou know I mean you you just have to cover your kids from then on you're done you're done goes you opted out you know I don't know you might be able to go back and if something got crazy but um but for now you could opt out okay and what that meant I guess for that matter I don't know that you have to opt out do you\nOut what's your household income or about Seventy thousand Seventy okay and what does your son make\nA hint shed got and job about twenty thousand dollars a hour for about twenty to twenty five hours a week\nHe's working twenty hours a week [noise]\nOkay what's she doing with the rest of his time\nHe he he\nDoesn't want to have found that when I quit his job because he's been trying to get into the job forever because\nWhy would a conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight on call 'em for this job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week\n... hours a week ... ... ... TV station ... in ... I'm going to have a football game and does it go to fix for him again\nYou know why would you be on call for football there is no emergency football\n[laughter] but he's been trying to get into the TV station here and\nI got that part where he's working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she came pages that gum twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to work another forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing football\nSo she can pay is freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that sound that would sound awesome\nI Try to tell him that when I get\nOut and get them to come through and I think and I do not have to pay out\n... thirty in the late ... thirty the ugly ... you don't work much\nYeah yeah it was a great place to go when you're broke to work so\nUh what I Would tell him to do is get into financial peace university and get his young budding gear and stuff\nBut on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker and his momma is calling me you single moms are single lady out here when you're fifty what that was fifty fifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills\nYeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on his little head okay\nYou know and then you you better plan on paying it if that ... doesn't get moving okay so you know ball and knock it out and then you'd miss chalk it up to that and but dude I'm telling you ah we're going to have some discussions is he married\nOkay I'll bet she works forty hours yeah yeah\nThere you go [noise] alright open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nAnd thank you I don't hear about my budget activity every dollar touch it among baby step to great protect my expenses for them on a\nProject what I'm going to be paying for that and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down I had to have it in repaired and it costs five hundred dollar\nBills and how often that we know that one of them are often do you have your your baby steps one with a thousand dollars right\nI Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it was I simply added a new line item to my budget for that item and then reduce the amount that I pay toward that for that month so I get it wrong\nThat will be okay you cash flow did you just ... but if you can cash flow in that month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on that each month\nGood and so you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap with this thing but usually you're not going to have that month in a month out now there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor ... you know you don't have anything budgeted\nFor car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to\nHave anything that she did for car repairs yeah\nI probably would put something in there for the cause of the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to spend something on the car in a given six month period of time it might be tires it might be maintenance you might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spin something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard\nSo probably gonna have a little bit of a sudden it to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up\nAs a sinking fund they call it than the every dollar software or in a ... I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you uh have the money in cash then for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected\nEmergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did fine just to cash flow through that emergency you slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully won't have another one of those and you can really\nGood question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nI did hear free shouldn't be doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nCan you monitor laid we've been together a long time you and I [laughter]\n[noise] so the question to you so my wife and I\nOnly have about three hundred okay and and did another hundred and Fifteen and automobile a line of credit that type of thing so it's about four Fifteen\nAnd we make a pretty good income shoot at about one twenty annually I met one eighty three hundred come on the question for you it I was a move back to school to get my masters the programs only twenty five okay to feel like that would be a very real are why on it\nBut over the last three days are starting to think who may be maybe I shouldn't just want to get your take on that\n... masters in what [noise] oh it would be an ...\n... ...\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K [laughter]\nYou'd probably be hard to say I'm there would be a winning case and you raise because of the category of jump into\nMhm okay you're going to get back into would make it back in touch over a year then from\nThat point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you live in in a very expensive area granted it's crazy expensive but I don't want to live in a really rough ... yeah but you guys are really you are really ... ...\n... and so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that may be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nBut you know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you scare me by buying anything else you bought enough for a while you need that you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this debt calling\nIn in the process of doing that can you we've twenty grand a police officer in the end of the budget pressure\nYour life so he gets time the rest of this\nThis is the rams\nWere the top\nRamsey scot free advice in\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring\nThe smart thing to do is to go to zip\nRecruiter dot com slash Dave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes\nIdentifies people with the ride skills education and experience for your job\nAnd actively invites them do apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast and right now my listeners can try zip recruiter for free at zip recruiter dot com\nThey are and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a used pickup truck both or transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall\nAnd answer if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nThere in Florida you go to the University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful thing you want to but wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to aim at\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make a scholarship hunting your full time job\nOr after school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and he probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for ... that'd be pretty cool\nNot a bad part time job the third thing is planning on working\nA lot while you are\nSo that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do well talking about minimum wage crap and if you're gonna live on campus go ahead and be an All right be a residential advisor or written that's what they call it what is in RA\nHow it is it is a resident advisor okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be in our a if you're going to live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their cigarette scholarships or somebody pays you to get there and then plant on working your butt off\nAnd those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nMr Ramsey ... thank you for everything that you do think you

South Carolina middle Tennessee Missouri Tennessee a\nGuy that you look at your own schedule is the door to schedule isn't any any better than went out and has done either and they're still plenty of games the point I Will be impressed with Georgia once they play LSU Florida in Kentucky a three straight weeks but to this point as failing anybody\nI totally agree and you know what the schedules yet they've got to go to share this coming home is good but yeah you gotta go over there by\nAll the chow hall case because he has to play rarely way I can tell when it got to be all things and that you know Alabama and yelled at our sat but at\nThe time the excitement is shared the we've got a good football team in Alabama needs to be worried about it and only about Georgia we don't have problems in office of land by the time we can do you have been back we want to say it's a fine and it will be like me to the ball\n... great alliteration they're they're all we love that\nDavis in Toledo Dave thank you welcome to the show\nThey fall how you doing that okay thank you\nHaven't talked to a few weeks the last time I called it was a butter written my hair and I just want to know if you've got to see that to a game I predicted he would walk into a standing ovation and they were they were with T shirts and praising him and everything and he had to smile back\nOn to say I saw like up there never happened\nThat's how college football is Dave uh as long as you when nobody cares what are we going to get their\nAbsolutely you out for the real reason my ... at a few what else with Alabama if you could possibly answer them for me I don't know how to tie breakers working the FCC kind of present well but um [noise] what happens if Alabama goes into death daily beat LSU\nAnd then all of our incomes then but there was some miracle happens of pulling up said it'd be some at the end of the season and all three of them end up with one law who goes to the championship\n[noise] yeah um I think uh I think it depends\nOn whether you're you're winner or losses in the division and the writing that they'd all be in the same division okay then then I think it goes to\nA I think there are a ...\nI'm afraid to answer the question because I Do sometimes is different I think there's a ranking issue as well\nVery salty coming up here in the next few weeks\nYeah brutal brutal play and that's the reason why playoff ranked are still only gives the LSU a six percent chance to make it as a you know just a long shot because of that for Dan stretch that's coming up plus out and then at the end of the year I think the interesting thing is there's a lot of focus on that Georgia LSU game but\nDon't sleep on this week's contest at Florida that's again the FBI actually thinks the Florida is favor ought to be favored by about three points a field goal or so it'll be an interesting test for Ellis shoes off and against Florida's defense that could be a game that trip dubbed the tigers head of Georgia\nYou don't want to get inside that game because you're right I mean there's just as a I've been up here today in New York telling friends that I've talked to watch out for the for for Florida in there and everyone's looking at me like are you out of your mind\nI think the funny thing is like there's a lot of\nMaybe positive feelings about let's use off as coming off that game it gets old mess but let's remember I'm In southern Illinois put on forty one ... to win\nLSU puts up forty five does that really mean that that they've proven themselves I'm not so sure I think that I Need to see and against the better decent wanted like Florida before I start to believe in that\nFinally Notre Dame has certainly a big game this weekend they they've had a lot of big games ah\nBush Virginia Tech before we even get into Notre Dame which the casualty of that O. D. you the Old Dominion loss for them how does that affect the everything else because these things are all interrelated aren't they\nAbsolutely all all interrelated and it does it does mean that Virginia Tech is not as significant as ... as an opponent I'm as we thought for Notre Dame and obviously one credit them with the type of wind that maybe you thought it would be a couple of weeks ago if they were to be Virginia Tech all that being said\nFBI still thinks that this is Notre Dame toughest remaining game of the season and when you look down their schedule kind of like we talked about with Penn State's not that tough and so you can imagine a situation where Notre Dame who went out and the question or named fans are probably wondering now is what if we lose one of these games will drop to Virginia Tech\nAt that point it's out of your hands you need help but I think they're in a better position to make the playoff or Lebanon one today than they were a few weeks ago just because they had some statement wins there can prove that sort of quality of their team to the committee\nWant to go back to a another question that keeps being brought up and that's the two SEC schools given should the skinny on and I realize it's October early October both a is a crowded field a problem for us\n... and ... and ... anytime you're talking about these undefeated a undefeated conference champions are talking about Notre Dame are screwing things up for the as they say that's all they were all that being said I Do think that uh\nThe SEC is actually still are really good spot to get two teams and because of what we talked about kind of at the top which is that\nEven though there haven't been a ton of upset so these top teams yet it's still pretty reasonable to assume that it will come so we think there's only like\nA Fifteen Percent chance that three or more ... power five conferences to have an undefeated champion and obviously the the the ... the conference with the best chance to do that\nSo it's always a pleasure look forward to talking to you again next week thank you for coming on baseball\nReally great stuff as always well we talked to him every Wednesday we're

do wonder what why there was one of the guys not getting more and I hear the same thing from\nAlabama fans lawyer has he has and play a whole game doesn't make any difference he's leading the he he is today is the highest been was award and he would win\n[laughter] I don't know what else you can ask for for for a guy that it's a relatively new Steve is next job in Athens Steve go ahead you're on the air\n[laughter] hey Paul thanks for taking my call 'em thank you\nI just want to say that first of all Darryl if not indicative of the bulldog nation\nA region I usually get that emotional\nAh but I Would like to talk to you first about the difference between Georgia and Kentucky and where they are as teams okay\nUh Kentucky right now is playing with chip on their shoulder a which is great I mean I Love what they're doing with the program\nA I think that they uh they have a lot of success in front of me and let's face it for the past four decades they've been pretty much a train wreck aw with momentary spurts of success and I love everything that they're doing\nA Georgia right now and I am a true Georgia fan or is not playing with that chip on their shoulder and there should be\nThey are they're not playing like they didn't lose the national championship game last year they think that because they're right number two that they deserve to be ranked number two and I just haven't seen that out of this key right now\n[noise] ah what do you think yeah\nI agree with you on that I I think uh I think Georgia is still coming together a little bit um I I didn't I I Would I Would have them in the top four but they wouldn't be a\nNumber to an end by the way that doesn't mean a thing right now because to me Georgia will will display what whatever it's all about in the next couple of weeks so I mean you're talking about LSU next week Florida in three weeks of Auburn in six weeks\nAlabama Kentucky\nKentucky or I mean there's just not a\nYou know and I always kind of hate you know before the season we talk about games and then we're in this but certain games will define programs in Alabama and Georgia right now have not been tested so are you have to look look down the road and see where when will they be tested oral anyone test them\nWell I I think right now uh the the Kentucky Wildcats are probably the top teams that are I Am concerned with as a bulldog than\nTo actually uh supersede them in the east\nThose are the ... does look like the two best teams but it's still evolving in my opinion and we are going to talk in a moment with a writer who believes Ohio State is better than Alabama that's not reason to stop traffic on Fifth Avenue but it is reason to have him on our show\nAnd by the way I I was asked this morning I'm On my Greenberg to uh give him my top for him I have the exact same for you had a I had I don't know how we stayed a change so you're you're not going to get much a dissent from me I Do want to take this a little bit deeper because the\n... with that conversation leads to the next one uh Haskins and into debt have emerged as the two most quarterbacks at least a in terms of highs when consideration how would you break that one down right now\nYeah I mean I've seen Ohio State or a yellow live the last five years I guess it I you know I thought shaky part yeah sorry the college football player you know ... some of the best numbers of all time\nUm but you can take so much money for the last couple of years where there was ... or even join Haskins was coming on last year it seemed like Ohio State kept on trying to to replace them\nUm so we kinda new ... was was going to be a really tough like recruit I have lived up to the building so far are you you've been very impressed by the better thrower a bit better pass\nYeah if you go further down I think off actually I think they have more weapons and they have had the last couple of years I'm ...\nI'm the same thing I mean I you know going back to the national championship game last year yeah amazing you know the ... ... what he's been you know the ... you know I I vote for the hype and as well I'm actually the state rep in in New Jersey I mean\nRight now of is ever trick too premature to to look at the height and those would be lined up or talk to and I think too it'd probably be the uh you know little bit ahead of of of a half years at this point\nTeeth are so are you with us or certainly are writes ah in New Jersey or for\nOr the or the\nSyndicate up there are also a in Newark or let me ask you though are because\nYou're you you have a different perspective because you do see a lot of Big Ten in in and I I'm I'm really interested in Rutgers because that's so the school you see all the time they've been in the Big Ten now it it's been a difficult transition where is that program and will they uh they ever be competitive\nUm it's a great question um year one they came in and I think um you know there was still you know they had some talent and it was a senior driven team and they actually had some immediate sense that they went eight and five they wonder ballgame\nAnd or if they want a couple of big big time daily beat Michigan when Michigan was down ... Brady hook that final year\nAlmost be Penn State as a as well so they are everyone kind of thought that that would springboard him they haven't since then you know they they've you know went through you know I Am horrible period in which you know they went on and see a pro probation two years have been a probation\nOr the new coach Chris ... Ohio Ohio State guy came from Wisconsin and Ohio State um came in there the total house cleaning he shouldn't ... year three um\nThe big can schedule is brutal as you know I'm a big town east division you know there's just fail at this point Rutgers is nowhere near you know they don't have the talent level to to be able to compete with the you know the Penn State's Ohio said in Michigan saves\nI'm On a on a weekly basis their recipe either formula for success is going to be to when they're non conference games\nAnd then to beat Indiana Maryland two teams that are similar and and and you know Jason in talent level at this point\nUm and this year they haven't done that they they lost to\nA non conference games that they really shouldn't have lost that Kansas last the buffalo which has you know really different directors fan base up in arms and and you know rightly so those are two games at this point that there is no excuse that you know Chris that should be able to win 'em\nThe rest of the way it's going to be tough I mean there's ... there are probably gonna be an underdog and every game arrested away one ... year three\nUm I've seen you know various things if you look at you know the joke that a lot of fans nationwide but think that Chris ... is on the hot seat he's on a hot you here's an eighty who is totally supportive\nOf them knows what he inherited and I really knows what the challenges yell considering they still have another year probation left\nBefore you go to these uh I I Am interested in in your view of over ... stories are we mentioned you mentioned Ohio State which is\nHow quickly the urban Meyer story has they say that but what about Jim ... a off to a decent storage now he lost to Notre Dame no shame there but what's your view of ... inside the Big Ten\nI actually picked them um to win the big Ken I'm and I actually you know some you know before the year I thought they would lose another day in which they did and then I thought they would be able to they figure it out the rest of the way I Would back off my my prediction for him to begin\nI I Know they they play a certain style football that you know they're just not going to be I thought he'd be a he'd have found a quarterback at this point I just looked at ... you know it has a history suggests that he is do we\nKnow it's been like a quarterback whisper ah every stop stop a guy that I'm as dumbfounded everyone else it that they haven't really been able to click\nYou know northwestern and they yell quality program you know that that it is not intending to let you know to the last three years but\nYou know for for them to almost lose ... you know a head scratcher I Know they won the game but um\nYeah at this point um I think that they're they're they're yelling notch below um there are a couple of notch below Ohio State clearly and then you know not all a Penn State in Michigan State could go either way though you know we could be looking at another yeah fourth place finish in the Big Ten for that\nKey Sargent or who has been a ... vote in a chooses Ohio State over Alabama and he came on this program and lived to tell about it\n[laughter] I Am I allowed to keep my ...\nYeah well you have to yeah you know day at a we had one of your colleagues who\nAh who ... who went with a\nCleansing last week uh yeah it it got a little bit contentious I I I buy what you say I mean I may have a slight disagreement but I thought you are\nYou're very fair and objectivity ... he came in just basically saying that's how I vote before the season and I'm not change uh again that's that's his ... yeah\nYeah I mean I I I don't again I I\nSpend a lotta time on a lake Saturday Night early Sunday Morning or crafting it and I do try to reward teams that play someone at that point and I'm not trying to put a team that you know number ... who who I think is the twenty eighth best team in a country another one I I Do think Ohio State is top three team I think that\nThey're

thirty some ... million dollars\nAnd with that money the state decided they wanted to serve seniors with this money so they came up with a program for nonprofits across the state to apply for\nA new idea to serve seniors with his money\nAnd habitat of Tennessee and our Memphis habitat program\nCombined together to fill out the application and apply and habitat of Tennessee actually received the largest amount of funding from this grant so we it is kind of aging in place grant\nSo with this um it's going to be part of our neighbor to neighbor but it'll stand kind of on its own because a homeowner won't have to pay anything\nUm but as the population is aging we need people to stay in their homes we don't want them to go to a nursing home we don't want them to have to get more support if we can make their home accessible so this'll include everything from adding grab bars widening doors building ramps\nAnd also if there's a major problem psych roof repair and so forth and again this will be for us and putting them in overeating county like I said there's about Fifteen affiliates that have received this funding it's a three year program\nWe've received enough to do about close to sixty projects over the next three years and it won't have any cost to the homeowners so we're very excited about it um we're going to do um\nWe're right now working on\nGetting subcontractors electricians and plumbers I'm certified to work with is because some of the work will set out to them a lot of the work are volunteers will do that refers you know we don't do roofing work anyway so we have to get some roofing contractor is ready so when we have a roof project\nThey've followed all the guidelines that the state is put out and we can assign them the job but we're very excited about it we see the need and both counties I'm the house sitting\nYou know the housing um stock and they used both communities especially in over dinner aging you know um there's just a lot of need for families to stay in their homes\nYes there there is now [noise] you should have had of Tennessee awarded I guess a lot of this money so if your habitat affiliate instead of Tennessee

heavy that that we have access to the White House and\nOn on this little dog and pony show where you have your you know pretty often\nBut it it is because um you could either wait for the media to tell you what the White House is saying or you can read the president's tweets or talk to Kellyanne or somebody else there so it's always great and um it sounds like\nShe's in alignment with you which is that there's going to be a vote this week on a on Brett Kavanaugh in the car I think there should have been about last week on Brett Kavanaugh because um these allegations had no teeth at all\nBut the weird part for me is and those of you listening in Arizona I mean maybe you can help me out with this guy but Jeff Flake pretends that he's ready to vote for cabinet or in the full Senate provided they do an FBI investigation for a week\nAnd Gary correct me if I'm wrong I keep hearing that flake is talking about how he can't put somebody on the court now who's got that temperament\nI have seen Santa than support yes but that everybody that that's the way they take that last week\nRight that was basically he gave his word just the duty investigation you've got my vote and now suddenly it's about temperament so exactly what I said would have happened happened last week when they put the vote off and they said let's wait for the investigation\nUm the next thing you know is there are going to be some more allegations there were although they were fake one guy just had a like going to hundreds they made it up and he's like he's now facing an FBI investigation\nAnd then I said that there would be more that would come out about him\nAnd now the temperament thing is what they thought they could latch onto because of how you reacted\nWhen he gave his opening statement last week so suddenly he's in bar fights and stuff so that's exactly what they're trying to prove a and then there was this very specious allegation about why he lied under oath he committed perjury and then that was completely blown out of the water because I guess NBC News reporting on this\nDid not report everything that was said\nBecause he does in fact say that what happened happened or that he knew about something that was happening um and it was reported as if he said he didn't know\nWhich wasn't true so the whole thing stinks just do the bill already Jeff Flake is out soon and if he is going to be a lobbyist as Michael Malice was saying the other day if he's going to be a lobbyist he's going to get a whole lot of help from people on the right I'm In that he's trying to stop this\nUm this nomination from happening it's very strange to me I think you will at least see McCaskill and probably um\nOh who's the guy in in West Virginia mansion you probably will see them\nUm go for Kavanaugh as well so it probably will be fifty two fifty one or fifty two maybe even fifty three depending on what\nCollins and Murkowski in these in these others do there really isn't anything else they can drop now that would be relevant to stop this vote from happening but I Do wish that somebody would ask the question and I think it's a good journalistic question\nHey senator Booker grow because hey senator Coons say senator Harris hey senator Columbus or will you vote yes to confirmed this guy if the investigation shows nothing new but nobody asked that\nQuestion I think that that's a valid question we go to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to a good on the line to actually barber wants to talk about Minnesota politics the barbecue hold on until after we have dug ward low he'll be at the bottom of the hour this way we can talk to in context to that uh that it\nIt's a race for attorney general in that state that the entire nation if not the world is watching between Keith Ellison and Douglas we'll have more information as we do that let me go to a is it a go ahead\nKeith Ellison thought that he would be the chairman of the DNC he was actually upset when Tom for as one and and now he's the vice chair as you said this is one he's one of the faces of a party\nUm and he's faces these allegations and you said this very well known repeated these are recent allegations I mean as recently as August\n... the number out of hand sun is out there you know publishing the allegations\nMe this isn't something that's thirty six years ago that you can't remember what House you were in or one day of the week it was her who went in there um is is Monaghan fully cooperating because you would have to assume that politically she might be similar to him since she was linked with him for for a while she cooperating and\nAnd will there be a prosecution in your opinion\nWell they shouldn't be a criminal investigation they there should be the ... the ... the Democrat here in Minnesota right around the clock they're trying to early voting has already started in Minnesota that kind of round the clock they're trying to\nCall her investigation and of course things happen to them or sex\nOr by that I actually have a you know on that day like little occurred yeah as a prejudiced round the clock and and we've got to stop them from doing they tell us and\nAt one of the base of the Democratic party nationally who wants to be the attorney general Minnesota and yet it said this on TV yeah is that he wants to drink so he can basically it struck President Trump's agenda he wants to bring lawsuits against the president\nOf the things from immigration to the Internet wants to lead the charge and other Democrats state attorneys general when just read a little Oregon the president and that's just inappropriate\nEight so I dug wardlaw he's the Republican running for attorney general great state of Minnesota I think he should win\nThe polls are very close right now but it's important to reiterate what you just said he's running or just as an anti Trump guy the attorney general's job is I'm guessing you know 'cause you want the job is not to make law is not going to bring frivolous suit is not to to argue because of your political or religious or whatever persuasion it is to follow the law\nProbably was a very good mentor for key fell as soon as to what he would do as a G because as the attorney general for the United states of America Eric Holder only took his walking papers and talking papers from Obama and obstructed justice if nothing else if you get the job\nWhat do you see the job as and keep in mind Minnesota was almost read almost when Trump in the last election so it's a very very tight race for good reason what do you bring to the people who are listening watching right now that that Keith Ellison couldn't\nASL is I'm wearing the date of politics out of the offices stand up or or law they trade is a law enforcement\nIn the legislature makes the laws and the executive branch attorney general and forces of execution laws and not rank of course policy not right away the political war with the office and focus on getting Minnesota ... say ... or say love it's a very simple math isn't is ratcheting process on\nA ... a G dot com Doug toward low W. A. R. D. L. O. W. A. G. dot com that Doug as far as I'm watching with Keith bellows soon as saying he is like gladly saying I I Would love to bring more refugee easier I Would love to keep on bringing people in that we don't really have a chance to vet\nUm that we should probably fight the president's attempt to stop bringing people in from places that we can't vet and Minnesota should just be where they where they put these people I mean that's a really odd tactic why does he think that's going to work and then why is he tied with you in the polls which is strange to me\nWell we're we're we're going to name recognition and and building that up until about ... we're still getting the message out to folks and it's going very well and just need to raise\nA little bit more money and get the message out there and I think that as a credible across the state talking to folks get the message out there they're coming on board and grows and we have the momentum that's very good ... else's answer all the more you know the war started in the made a re a here in Minnesota\n... what did he where I actually going to hear what you said he wore\nA T shirt in the ... here in Minnesota that red in Spanish I don't believe in ... I was recently interview and and he said that he thinks general orders create an injustice so how can a person doesn't leading the concept of borders and the state's top law enforcement official\n... if he doesn't believe in border is going to go out on a whim here he doesn't believe in the sovereignty of our nation\nI mean if things had borders should not exist he's literally saying Canada and Mexico are part of this country\nAnd they're not I mean there's a reason why people keep on trying to come here because it's better on this side of the border that's one of the border is necessary so we know exactly who's coming what they are bringing with them whether they're legal to come here and so on I ... I could never understand the guy like a Keith Ellison saying\nEverybody should be able to flood the state because that will change anything of course it'll change something they'll bring with them whenever it is that that was bothering them or didn't work for them and their and their previous country um the ... that's an important piece of information\nIt's forty one eye it's forty one to forty one right now\nFourteen percentage point you're telling me are undecided\nUndecided these are listening and they're watching right now in key fellow students history as an alleged abuser is important his history is an open borders guy is important\nBut in every ... in everyday life for Minnesotans they don't think well I Wonder if the agency is doing from you today so why should they lean your way and not his way because again once you are he takes the office they don't think about that job much\nRight they should come away with Keith Ellison who were elected as Minnesota less safe as a less they're hitting the flip side of the train gal\nWho's going to wait taxpayer resources and wait for a war against President Trump has completely inappropriate is going to be to distract and doing all of that\n... to focus on the thing that they shouldn't do namely that in a county attorney and prosecutors they rather than the opiate epidemic on dealing with human traffic or problem with that in Minnesota they're selling things that need to focus on it and bring law enforcement our deal with that we'll just see the ... to ... wait in his book the worst\nWhere he should be enforcing the law Doug I appreciate just dug ward low A. G. dot com and W. A. R. D. L. O. W. H.
